5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two on Thursday and one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain on the days before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small amount of evaporation had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through overnight in an effort to drain collected water and prevent further seepage. CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the pace car onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No improvement was reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after {{a certain point in}} the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|E

25|$|Nietzsche {{found in}} {{classical}} Athenian tragedy {{an art form}} that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in The Birth of Tragedy was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttrieben ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is {{the horror of the}} annihilation of the principle of individuality {{and at the same time}} someone who delights in its destruction. Both of these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> art as the power of nature in man.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Washington-Franklin issues (1908–11), every design {{incorporated}} {{a pair of}} olive branches surrounding {{one or the other}} of the two profiles. From 1912 on, however, the Franklin-head issues would instead appear with Oak leaves near the bottom of the oval in the image. Olive branches and Oak leaves are often used as symbols for peace (Olive branches) and strength (Oak leaves), though no significance was officially acknowledged in their use here. The Washington-Franklins were issued in denominations ranging from 1-cent to 5-dollars, each value printed in different color ink. The two engravings of either Washington or Franklin are employed in five basic design themes (i.e., framework, ornaments, lettering) which in turn were used to print more than 250 separate and distinct stamp issues over a fourteen-year period. During this time seven separate series of the Washington-Franklins appeared in succession, each series differing somewhat from its predecessor in physical characteristics (i.e., paper type, perforation size, etc.), while some series would also introduce new denominations printed with new colors. Produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington D.C., these issues were generally printed by the flat-plate process, but several of the issues also employed other new and experimental printing methods, including use of the revolutionary rotary printing press and the offset printing process. The first Washington-Franklin postage stamp to be released was a two-cent stamp issued on November 16, 1908. Other denominations soon followed and would continue to <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> the first World War years, with the last Washington-Franklin postage stamp issued in 1923. The series thus survived for almost fifteen years, longer than any previous U. S. Postage Stamp series produced by a single printing organization.|$|E

500|$|Having won the ROH World Tag Team Championship, their tag team title accouterments equaled seven at the time. The Broken Hardy storyline was {{abruptly}} dropped {{without explanation}} following {{a new set}} of television tapings between March 2–5, 2017. The Hardys did not appear on the Thursday, March 9 airing of Impact Wrestling and there was no reference to the Tag Team Championship, but the Broken Hardys were last seen broadcast in their compound using Vanguard-1 to teleport them with the TNA World Tag Team Championship belts to their next location, only for Decay to <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> teleportation with the belts with Rosemary declaring the Broken Hardys, [...] "deleted, obsolete, and decay!". The following week on the March 16 show, Bruce Prichard cut a promo in the ring and said that the Tag Team Titles are won in the ring, not in space.

500|$|On 17 February, Henry Sutherland Edwards {{wrote in}} the Musical World: [...] "In almost all conjunctions of music and words, there is a {{sacrifice}} of one to the other; but in Thespis... Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece." [...] Similar reports continued to <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> early March, when Thespis closed. The final performance during the authors' lifetimes was given {{less than two months}} later, on 27 April, at a matinée for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at [...] "inflated prices". The actress was a Gaiety favourite, [...] "not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure." [...] Others recalled [...] "the charm of Mlle. Clary, with her pretty face and piquant broken English". She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion, and her song in Act II, [...] "Little Maid of Arcadee", was the only one chosen for publication.|$|E
500|$|On 12 October, {{there was}} another TV debate on RTÉ, this time on the Prime Time programme, with the seven {{candidates}} and Miriam O'Callaghan as moderator. The debate, lasting 90 minutes, took place on a Wednesday night, though Prime Time usually aired on a Tuesday and Thursday, and was announced a week in advance. Dana Rosemary Scallon read out a prepared statement {{towards the end of}} the debate, announcing that a [...] "malicious" [...] and [...] "false" [...] accusation has been made against her and her family in the United States and, while refusing to divulge any details, she said she would leave [...] "no stone unturned" [...] in her mission to track down the person or organisation responsible. Scallon was visibly upset and was comforted by other candidates. She met with her lawyers the next day. David Norris expressed sorrow for Scallon and comforted her, also expressing frustration at the general tone of the election campaign and saying the media had libelled him in some of its reports. Scallon told TV3 News on 14 October that a freelance journalist had told her the allegations would <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> the media. Miriam O'Callaghan's treatment of Martin McGuinness resulted in more than 100 complaints to RTÉ. O'Callaghan's RTÉ colleague Pat Kenny said he watched on [...] "with shock and horror because I don't think I've ever seen a politician ever interviewed on radio before and more or less called a murderer. That was kind of shocking." [...] McGuinness himself also expressed disappointment with O'Callaghan.|$|E

In 1998 QWho, a modification for Quake, featured the Daleks as adversaries.

Another unauthorised game is DalekTron, a based on [...] written to coincide with the 2005 series.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the later music—and a few earlier pieces such as Continuum—treats the pulse as a musical atom, a common denominator, a basic unit which cannot be divided any further. Different rhythms <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> multiplications {{of the basic}} pulse, rather than divisions: this is the {{principle}} of African music seized on by Ligeti. It also appears in the music of Philip Glass, Steve Reich and others; and significantly it shares {{much in common with}} the additive rhythms of Balkan folk music, the music of Ligeti’s youth. He described the music of Conlon Nancarrow, with its extremely complex explorations of polyrhythmic complexity, as [...] "the greatest discovery since Webern and Ives ... something great and important for all music history! His music is so utterly original, enjoyable, perfectly constructed, {{but at the same time}} emotional ... for me it's the best music of any composer living today." ...|$|E
2500|$|A paper card {{version of}} the MP Handy Guide was {{published}} with folded card sliders for the war effort {{under the auspices of}} the UK Ministry of Defence during World War II and was intended for use by people knitting gloves, socks and balaclavas for the troops. In the 1960s, The Aero Needles Group Plc of Redditch, England produced the Knitters Companion, a pocket {{version of the}} complex counter, consisting of a pierced bar of black plastic containing seven knurled, white, rotary, numbered discs whose numbers would <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> the piercings in the bar. [...] As in the MP Handy Guide, the numbers were labelled Increase, Decrease, Rows and Times. It was supplied with a soft plastic case which was intended to maintain memory of the count by preventing accidental movement of the discs. In 1972, UK magazine Woman's Weekly gave away its own card variation of this, with the numbers on dials with rotary paper pointers to record rows, increases or decreases, and times. Like the MP Handy Guide it incorporated a small inch-ruler and needle gauge, but now added a tension gauge measure and centimetre ruler.|$|E

2500|$|The Australian {{painted lady}} is {{remarkably similar to}} the painted lady (Vanessa cardui). It is {{differentiated}} by its smaller size, rarely exceeding 2 inches (5 cm) across its wings, and the blue colouration at {{the centre of the}} four eyespots on its hindwings. Its body is dark brown, almost black, all over, except the tips of the antenna which are white. The base of the wings are brown, which turns into a brick red colouration, broken by bands of black. The tips of the forewing are black with four white dots running from the apex of the wing, and a white bar extending from {{the leading edge of the}} forewing. The hindwings have four round eyespots at their base, with a blue centre for at least three. The underwings are almost identical to the upperwings, except the base of the underwings is brick red rather than brown. The Australian painted lady's colouration allows it to blend in effectively with the ground. Males and females look almost identical. The ovum is translucent green in colour and barrel shaped with 13 to 15 vertical ribs. Right before hatching, the black head and grey-tinted body <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> the shell.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{time when}} {{producers}} were structuring Shortland Street as a soap with a culturally diverse cast, the character of Grace Kwan was created - a hard working Asian doctor. In 1994, Lynette Forday joined the cast as the part of Grace. After 3 years on the soap, Forday left the soap with Grace making her final appearance in 1997. In 2013 Forday was offered to reprise the role after 16 years off screen, to which she was happy to agree. She signed an initial [...] "Major Recurring Guest" [...] contract, which would see the character <b>appear</b> <b>through</b> to 2014. Forday described returning to the set as [...] "odd" [...] but also [...] "wonderful". Forday had considered the idea of returning to play Grace as a [...] "no-brainer" [...] and was happy to work alongside her former co worker, Michael Galvin (Dr. Chris Warner), [...] "It was very surreal ... We have {{been doing a lot}} of work together and he's just lovely. He's been very helpful and is amazing." [...] In October Television New Zealand announced Grace would be returning to the show during the month. Grace made her return on screen on 23 October 2013. Grace departed on 24 February 2014 but returns a couple of months later in May 2014 she made her last appearance 11 December 2014.|$|E
