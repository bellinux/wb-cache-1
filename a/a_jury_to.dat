5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, mobile {{developers}} Lilith and uCool released their titles Dota Legends and Heroes Charge, respectively. Both titles {{were influenced}} by Dota and the sequels.

Breyer, felt that due to the trio's actions as maintainers of the Dota mods, that they rightful have copyright claim to this. Separately, Lilith and uCool argued that Eul had, in a forum post dated September 2004, assigned an open-source copyright license to Dota, which would make Valve and Blizzard's copyright claims void. The case is scheduled to be heard by <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> resolve this matter at a later date.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The prosecution is under a common law duty to disclose all relevant evidence including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should be able to follow proceedings and {{they have a right to}} be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

500|$|Randolph's {{enforcement}} {{attempts were}} vigorously resisted {{by both the}} merchant classes and sympathetic magistrates despite Bradstreet's attempts to accommodate Randolph. [...] Juries frequently refused to condemn ships accused of violating the acts; in one instance Bradstreet tried three times to get <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> change its verdict. [...] Randolph's attempts to enforce the navigation laws eventually convinced the colony's general court that it needed to create its own mechanisms for their enforcement. [...] A bill to establish a naval office was vigorously debated in 1681, with the house of deputies, dominated by the commonwealth party, opposing the idea, and the moderate magistrates supporting it. [...] The bill that finally passed was {{a victory for the}} commonwealth party, making enforcement difficult and subject to reprisal lawsuits. [...] Bradstreet refused to actually implement the law, and Randolph published open challenges to it. [...] Bradstreet was in some degree vindicated when he won re-election in 1682, and he then used his judicial authority to further undermine the law's effects.|$|E
500|$|Core intent {{would be}} where the {{defendant}} acted either to cause at least grievous bodily harm to the victim, or where the defendant acted to achieve some other aim, where the death caused was a necessary means to that other end. In general, the jury is directed that [...] "intent" [...] is to be taken as meaning what it does in ordinary life, and that the judge should not attempt to define it in other terms. However, following R v Woollin, {{it is also possible}} for <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> convict if they [...] "feel sure that death or serious injury was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) {{as a result of the}} defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case" [...] known as [...] "oblique intent". Despite appearing to present an alternative to the primary, core sense of intent, courts have generally seen Woollin as allowing the jury to infer core intent from the evidence of virtual certainty. The jury are entitled to convict in these circumstances, and they should not be directed that they, finding virtual certainty, must convict. However, if it is difficult to imagine circumstances where a jury would find virtual certainty but not convict, which would support this complicating factor. The exception for medical care is mentioned as a general principle for homicide.|$|E

Roosevelt convened <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> and got <b>an</b> indictment. In 1930, he announced a war against rackets which produced few results. Charges were filed against him for general negligence, urging his removal. This was common procedure by Anti-Tammany reformers since the precedent of 1900 when Governor Theodore Roosevelt removed D.A. Asa Bird Gardiner. This time the charges were ultimately dismissed by Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|R
