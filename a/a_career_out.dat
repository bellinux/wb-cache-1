5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that he could make <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} in {{his left}} knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play part-time for Hereford United, including in the first team {{when they were in}} the fourth, and later in the third, division of the English Football League. He was earning up to £33 a week. But in 1973, at the age of 21, the pain in his joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E

25|$|While many PCL players {{went on to}} play in {{the major}} leagues, teams in the league were often {{successful}} enough that they could offer competitive salaries to avoid being outbid for their players' services. Some players made <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of the minor leagues. One of the better known was Frank Shellenback, whose major league pitching career was brief, but who compiled a record PCL total of 295 wins against 178 losses. Many former major league players came to the PCL to finish their careers after their time in the majors had ended.|$|E

25|$|PETA is {{critical}} of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says should be with their mothers. In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had made <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of antagonizing frightened wild animals.

500|$|The most {{important}} casting decision {{was that of}} the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host, but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition. Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with preschoolers. Johnson said that what made Burns a great children's TV host was that [...] "he didn't want to be a children's host... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of it." [...] Burns remained on Blue's Clues for seven years and was in over 100 episodes before he left. Burns himself stated, [...] "I knew I wasn't gonna be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happenin'—fast." ...|$|E

[...] The band's 1986 studio album, Bedtime for Democracy, is a play on Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo and features a multitude of songs about Reagan. [...] "Potshot Heard Round the World" [...] is about U.S. military actions in the Middle East, [...] "with Reagans and Gaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes." [...] Reagan plays the title role in the song, [...] "Rambozo the Clown," [...] a portmanteau of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo franchise and Bozo the Clown from children's daytime TV. The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert the album Frankenchrist. Singer Jello Biafra chose {{to include in the}} album {{the first time he saw}} it, saying, [...] "“This picture is like Reagan America on parade." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{show was}} first aired in 1993, on the Israeli public Channel 1, {{formulated}} by producer Aaron Goldfinger, who envisioned {{a show in}} which political debates are taking place, {{and in the midst}} of these debates, small breaks that will include pop music, in an in-studio playing, that will be conducted by various singers and bands - and so the show was granted its name Popolitica (Pop+Politics). Within a short period of time, the show developed its characteristic format, and was regularly hosted by two veteran news and political show hosts, Nissim Mishal and later, Dan Margalit, and included the regular following [...] "panel": journalist Tommy Lapid (later made <b>a</b> political <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of his [...] "stardom" [...] as [...] "panelist" [...] of the show), journalist Amnon Dankner, and Haredi journalist Yisrael Eichler (also later made <b>a</b> political <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of his [...] "panelist" [...] role). The pop songs were gradually thinned out until they were completely removed, in a way that only the political-debates format remained, the debates that had granted the show its fame.|$|R

500|$|John L. Flynn, a Towson University English {{professor}} {{who has written extensively}} about science-fiction film, unfavorably compared Night of the Blood Beast to The Creeping Terror (1964), which was also about an astronaut returning from space with a stowaway alien creature. Although Flynn said it lacked the [...] "epic pretentiousness" [...] of that film, he nevertheless said of Blood Beast: [...] "Corman made <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of making cheap knock-offs of popular films, but he seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel here". The Washington Post writer Tom Shales said [...] "it would be hard to find a worse movie" [...] and that the monster [...] "looks like the San Diego Chicken after having been tarred and feathered". Film critic and historian Steven H. Scheuer said the plot was a good idea but criticized what he called a [...] "sloppy execution". Literary and film critic John Kenneth Muir said he considered the film a failure because the monster [...] "simply could not live up to expectations once revealed". Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars with the entry: [...] "Well directed, but too low budget to succeed." [...] Night of the Blood Beast was among several films universally considered terrible that film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed it on a B movie level, calling it [...] "cheap but enjoyable and buoyed by its ideas". John Stanley, who hosted the San Francisco television show Creature Features about science-fiction films, said Night of the Blood Beast deliberately imitated the best scenes from The Thing from Another World. Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the alien in the film [...] "looks like a human-sized parrot covered in feces" [...] and ranked it as the fifth worst movie monster of all time. However, he said that the film's idea of an alien impregnating a human being was an [...] "interesting concept," [...] noting that it was reused in Ridley Scott's Alien.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, Helen Brown of The Telegraph {{wrote that}} [...] "Gregory has made <b>an</b> {{impressive}} <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of breathing passionate, independent {{life into the}} historical noblewomen whose personalities had previously lain flat on family trees, remembered only as diplomatic currency and brood mares." [...] She added, [...] "Gregory’s historical fiction has always been entertainingly speculative (those tempted to sneer should note that she’s never claimed otherwise) and comes with lashings of romantic licence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Madsen later {{attended}} the Ted Liss Acting Studio in Chicago, and Harand Camp Adult Theater Seminar in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin.

5000|$|Despite {{having spent}} a {{substantial}} part of his career appearing in gun-toting roles such as cowboys, policemen, gangsters and military men, Widmark disliked firearms and was involved in several gun-control initiatives.

It seems incredible to me that the United States are the only civilized nation that does not put some effective control on guns." ...|$|R
