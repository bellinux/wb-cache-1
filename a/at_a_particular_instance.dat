In particular, when graph signals mostly capture the effect of a few processes on a graph topology, the graph signals can be modeled as the linear combinations of a small number of constitutive components in a spectral graph dictionary [2, 3]. Such dictionaries, which can also be seen as a set of spectral filters on graphs, incorporate the intrinsic geometric structure of the irregular graph domain into the atoms and are able to capture different processes evolving on the graph. Moreover, they can exhibit a polynomial structure [3] or can be approximated by polynomials of a graph matrix [4, 5] (e.g., spectral graph wavelets). As such, they can be implemented distributively and therefore represent ideal operators for graph signal processing in sensor networks 1.|$|R

How-ever, presence of time provides us {{with the opportunity to}} analyze the interaction patterns of the communities, understand how each individual community grows/shrinks, becomes important over time. This paper, for the first time, systematically studies the temporal interaction patterns of communities using a large scale citation network (directed and unweighted) of computer science. Each individual community in a citation network is naturally defined by a research field – i. e., acting as ground-truth – and their interactions through citations in real time can unfold the landscape of dynamic research trends in the computer science domain over the last fifty years. These interactions are quantified in terms of a metric called inwardness that captures the effect of local citations to express the degree of authoritativeness of a community (research field) <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> time <b>instance.</b> Several arguments to unveil the reasons behind the temporal changes of inwardness of different communities are put forward using exhaustive statistical analysis.

In this paper, we extend, implement, and investigate the Credit-based Algorithm for Service Traffic Shaping (CASTS) in a production level enterprise network setting.

30|$|Two major {{challenges}} {{arise in}} the assignment of a dedicated control channel for CRAHNs, namely, PU activity and spectrum heterogeneity. With regard to PU activity, in a CRAHN, a PU has higher priority than an SU. If an SU is operating on a particular frequency band and a PU comes back to that frequency band, the SU has to vacate that channel {{in favor of the}} PU and migrate to some other unused frequency band. Thus, in environments where PU activity is not known, it is impossible to guarantee that the particular frequency band of the designated control channel will always remain available in the presence of PU activity. With regard to spectrum heterogeneity, every SU observes a different set of available channels depending on its geographical location, each of which is a subset of the set of all the licensed channels. Due to this spectrum heterogeneity, very rarely can a channel commonly available to all SUs <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> be found. To account for PU dynamics and spectrum heterogeneity issues, several researchers have proposed cluster-based approaches for control channel design of CRAHNs [5 – 8]. In cluster-based control channel schemes for CRAHNs, a neighbor discovery (rendezvous) process is performed to set up an initial network topology. Based on the information exchanged during the rendezvous process, the nodes are partitioned into clusters depending on highly correlating spectrum opportunities. A comprehensive survey on rendezvous process for cognitive radio is presented [9]. After clustering, one or more channels that are common to nodes within each cluster are designated as the control channels.|$|E

Such modes are initially fast growing but, like related studies, {{we assume that the}} viscous, non-parallel spreading of the shear layer results in them evolving in a linear fashion until they reach a position where their amplitudes are large enough and their growth rates have diminished sufficiently so that amplitude equations can be derived using weakly nonlinear and non-equilibrium critical-layer theories. Four different basic integro-differential amplitude equations are possible, including one due to a novel mechanism; the relevant choice of amplitude equation, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance,</b> being dependent on the relative sizes of the disturbance amplitude, the growth rate of the disturbance, its wavenumber, and the viscosity of the fluid. This richness of choice of possible nonlinearities arises mathematically from the indicial Frobenius roots of the governing linear inviscid equation (the Taylor-Goldstein equation) not, in general, differing by an integer. The initial nonlinear evolution of a mode will be governed by an integro-differential amplitude equations with a cubic nonlinearity but the resulting significant increase {{in the size of the}} disturbance's amplitude leads on to the next stage of the evolution process where the evolution of the mode is governed by an integro-differential amplitude equations with a quintic nonlinearity. Continued growth of the disturbance amplitude is expected during this stage, resulting in the effects of nonlinearity spreading to outside the critical level, by which time the flow has become fully nonlinear...|$|E

Organelles are specialized membrane bound structures within a cell that function by interacting with cytosolic and luminal soluble proteins making the protein composition of each organelle dynamic. Depending on organism, {{the total number of}} organelles within a cell varies, indicating their evolution with respect to protein number and function. For example, one of the striking differences between plant and animal cells is the plastids in plants. Organelles have their own proteins, and few organelles like mitochondria and chloroplast have their own genome to synthesize proteins for specific function and also require nuclear-encoded proteins. Enormous work has been performed on animal organelle proteomics. However, plant organelle proteomics has seen limited work mainly due to: (i) inter-plant and inter-tissue complexity, (ii) difficulties in isolation of subcellular compartments, and (iii) their enrichment and purity. Despite these concerns, the field of organelle proteomics is growing in plants, such as Arabidopsis, rice and maize. The available data are beginning to help better understand organelles and their distinct and/or overlapping functions in different plant tissues, organs or cell types, and more importantly, how protein components of organelles behave during development and with surrounding environments. Studies on organelles have provided a few good reviews, but none of them are comprehensive.

40|$|Abstract—While {{developing}} a software system, the complexity in describing a problem should be reduced. This {{can be done}} by separating the concern in a clean and explicit way. Each of the concern can be addressed by partitioning a software system into modules. Concerns are clearly identifiable with a special linguistic construct called Aspects, which has been introduced by a new programming paradigm known as aspect-oriented programming. No doubt aspect-oriented programming brings lots of opportunities for the software developer. On the other hand, it is very difficult for analysing those programs for different software engineering activities. In such scenario, slicing plays a vital role. This paper proposes an approach to compute the dynamic slices of aspect-oriented programs. In our approach, we have introduced different level dependence graphs, such as aspect-oriented statement level dependence graph, aspect-oriented method level dependence graph, aspect-oriented AC weaving level depen-dence graph, aspect-oriented package level dependence graph to represent an aspect-oriented program under consideration. Then, we apply aspect-oriented reverse hierarchical dynamic slicing algorithm on the intermediate program representation to compute the dynamic slices. Our algorithm traverses the dependence edges starting from the slicing node in a reverse hierarchical manner to list the reached node, which constitute the dynamic slice of the aspect-oriented program under consideration. This approach is advantageous as it constructs the graph and computes the dynamic slices level wise. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> the level dependence graph is quite manageable and quickly traversed.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{observation of}} human locomotion has found considerable utility {{in the diagnosis}} of numerous neuromuscular pathologies. Unfortunately without {{the construction of a}} dynamical system model of the measured gait, the effectualness of these observations is restricted to just the existing diagnostic variety rather than the prediction of potential instabilities in gait or guiding the construction of user specific prosthetics. In order to construct a dynamical system model of an observed gait in an automated fashion, one requires a family of representations rich enough to describe the dynamics of gait and an automated procedure to select a particular representation capable of describing a given observation from this family. 		The goal of this thesis is to address these two problems. First, a hybrid dynamical system representation is introduced that is shown to be capable of describing the discontinuities in dynamics that occur during locomotion. In particular, such a representation is constructible from observation given an unconstrained Lagrangian which is intrinsic to the biped after the identification of the sequence of contact points that are enforced during the observed motion. Second, a specific hybrid dynamical system representation is shown to be constructible from observed data by optimally switching between the set of vector fields corresponding to all possible combinations of contact point enforcements. 		At this point an algorithm for the computation of an optimal control of constrained nonlinear switched dynamical systems is devised. The control parameter for such systems include a continuous-valued input and discrete-valued input, where the latter corresponds to the mode of the switched system that is active <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> in time. The presented approach, which this thesis proves converges to local minimizers of the constrained optimal control problem, first relaxes the discrete-valued input, performs traditional optimal control, and then projects the constructed relaxed discrete-valued input back to a pure discrete-valued input by employing an extension of the classical Chattering Lemma. This algorithm is extended by formulating a computationally implementable algorithm that works by discretizing the time interval over which the switched dynamical system is defined. Importantly, this thesis proves that the implementable algorithm constructs a sequence of points by recursive application that converge to the local minimizers of the original constrained optimal control problem. Four simulation experiments are included to validate the theoretical developments and illustrate its superiority when compared to standard mixed integer optimization techniques. 		The thesis concludes by applying the presented algorithm to perform the identification of a hybrid dynamical system representation of two classes of gaits. The first is a synthetic gait generated by the application of feedback linearization to a classical robotic bipedal model. For this synthetic observation, the presented identification scheme is able to correctly identify the correct model. The second set of gaits is one constructed from motion capture observations of 9 subjects during a flat ground walking experiment. For each subject, the presented identification scheme determines a distinct hybrid dynamical system representation.

40|$|The main {{themes of}} this thesis are {{networked}} dynamic systems and related cooperative control problems. We shall contribute {{a number of}} technical results to the stability theory of switched positive systems, and present a new cooperative control paradigm that leads to several cooperative control schemes which allow multi-agent systems to achieve a common goal while, at the same time, satisfying certain local constraints. In this context, we also discuss a number of practical applications for our results. On a very abstract level, we first investigate the stability of an unforced dynamic system or network that switches between different configurations. Next, a control input is included to regulate the aggregate behaviour of the network. Lastly, looking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> of this problem setting, an estimation component {{is added to the}} mix. To be more specific, we first derive a number of necessary and sufficient, easily verifiable conditions for the existence of common co-positive linear Lyapunov functions for switched positive linear systems. This is particularly useful given the classic result that, roughly, existence of such functions is sufficient for exponential stability of the switched system under arbitrary switching. Such switched systems may represent a networked dynamic system that switches between different configurations. Next, we develop several cooperative control schemes for networked, dynamic multi- agent systems. Several decentralised algorithms are devised that allow the network to achieve what may be called implicit, constrained consensus: Constrained {{in the sense that the}} aggregate behaviour of the network (assumed to be a function of the totality of its states) should assume a prescribed value; implicit in the sense that the consensus is not to be reached on the states directly, but on values that are a function of the states. This can be used to assure inter-agent fairness in some sense, which makes this result relevant to a large class of real-world problems. Initially, three algorithms will be given that work in a variety of settings, including non-linear and uncertain settings, time-changing and asymmetric network topologies, as well as asynchronous state updates. For these results, the general assumption is that the aggregate behaviour of the network is made accessible to each node so that it can be incorporated into the control algorithm. Then, a somewhat more specific application is addressed, namely (algebraic) connec- tivity control in wireless networks. This is a setting where the aggregate behaviour (the network’s connectivity level, roughly an algebraic measure of how well information can flow through the network) has to be estimated first before it can be regulated. To that end, a fully decentralised scheme is developed that allows the connectivity level to be estimated locally in each node. This estimate is then used to inform a decentralised scheme to adjust the nodes’ interconnections in order to drive the network to the desired connectivity level. Finally, three further real-world applications are discussed that rely on the results pre- sented in this thesis...|$|E
