In a moment one goes over the years; every shrub, every turn, every peep of the house has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>history</b> in it. The weather is {{delightful}} and the place looks beautiful. The trees are all so grown and there a thousand pretty sheltered spots, which near the sea in this season is very pleasant. The birds sing, the flowers blow, and make me for moments forget the world and all the villainy and tyranny going on in it.|$|E

I then summarise the policy response of recent Labour administrations, briefly detail the effects of this response, and finally offer my own three-pronged policy attack on our thus far really quite stubborn inequalities in health...|$|R

60|$|Many people, however, {{can read}} treatises and cannot read Bibles. Darwin {{could not read}} Shakespear. Some who can read both, like to learn {{the history of their}} ideas.

60|$|The {{first task}} before us in Europe is, at any cost, to release our {{children}} from this nationalist obsession, {{to teach the}} mass of European people <b>a</b> <b>little</b> truthful <b>history</b> in which each one will see the past and future of his own country in their proper proportions, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> truthful ethnology in which each country will get over the delusion that its people are a distinct and individual race.

60|$|It {{fell into}} two pretty clearly defined parts. We learnt reading and writing, {{we made a}} certain study of grammar, the method of language, perhaps we learnt the {{beginnings}} of some other language than our own; we learnt some arithmetic and perhaps a little geometry and algebra; we did some drawing. All these things were ways of expression, means of expressing ourselves, means of comprehending our thoughts in terms of other people's minds, and of understanding the expressions of others. That was the basis and substance of our schooling; a training in mental elucidation and in communication with other minds. But also as our schooling went on there was something more; we learnt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>history,</b> some geography, the beginnings of science. This second part of education {{was not so much}} expression as wisdom. We learnt what was generally known of the world about us and of its past. We entered into the common knowledge and common ideas of the world.|$|E
6000|$|But Annie, who {{was reading}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>history</b> of St. Paul, would call Cilicia, Cicilia, and when told to spell it {{she began to}} cry too decidedly for Susan's good-nature to check her tears. And not only did Elizabeth's copy look as if she had written it with claws instead of fingers, but she was grieving over her spotted cotton instead of really seeking for places in her map. Thus the Moselle obstinately hid itself; and she {{absolutely}} shed tears because Miss Fosbrook declared that Frankfort WAS on the Maine. For {{the first time she had}} her grammar turned back upon her hands. How many mistakes Annie made would be really past telling; for these two little girls had their whole minds quite upset by the thought of a day's pleasure; and as they never tried to restrain themselves, and to [...] "be sober, be vigilant," [...] they gave way before all the little trials in their paths- -were first careless, and then fractious. Perhaps when they were older they would find out that this uplifted sense of excited expectation is the very warning to be heedful.|$|E
60|$|I {{had another}} adventure, which puts this matter out of doubt, and {{which may be}} an {{instruction}} for posterity {{in the case of}} a pickpocket. My good old governess, to give a short touch at her history, though she had left off the trade, was, as I may say, born a pickpocket, and, as I understood afterwards, had run through all the several degrees of that art, and yet had never been taken but once, when she was so grossly detected, that she was convicted and ordered to be transported; but being a woman of a rare tongue, and withal having money in her pocket, she found means, the ship putting into Ireland for provisions, to get on shore there, where she lived and practised her old trade for some years; when falling into another sort of bad company, she turned midwife and procuress, and played a hundred pranks there, which she gave me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>history</b> of in confidence between us as we grew more intimate; and it was to this wicked creature that I owed all the art and dexterity I arrived to, in which there were few that ever went beyond me, or that practised so long without any misfortune.|$|E
60|$|That mortal {{man should}} feed upon the {{creature}} that feeds his lamp, and, like Stubb, eat {{him by his}} own light, as you may say; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go <b>a</b> <b>little</b> into the <b>history</b> and philosophy of it.|$|R
