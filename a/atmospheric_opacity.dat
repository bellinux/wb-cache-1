Our analysis also assumes that Vega is spherically symmetric and its atmosphere is well described with the plane parallel approximation. – 2 – Comparing observations and computed fluxes {{we have been able}} to discriminate between two different flux scales that have been proposed, the IUE-INES and the HST scales, favoring the latter. The effective temperature and angular diameter derived from the analysis of observed optical and near-UV spectra are in very good agreement with previous determinations based on different techniques. The silicon abundance is poorly constrained by the UV observations of the continuum and strong lines, but the situation is more favorable for carbon and the abundances inferred from the UV continuum and optical absorption lines are in good agreement.

Here we explore the planet’s circulation {{as a function}} of atmospheric metallicity and atmospheric composition, modeling atmospheres with a low mean-molecular weight (i. e., H 2 -dominated) and a high mean-molecular weight (i. e. water- and CO 2 -dominated). We find that atmospheres with a low mean-molecular weight have strong day-night temperature variations at pressures above the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superro-tation. For these atmospheres, the enhancement of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>opacities</b> with increasing metallicity lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperature variations and hence stronger superrotation.

50|$|CO line intensities are {{calibrated}} {{using the}} room-temperature chopper-wheel method and the two-layer atmosphere model of Kutner (1978). At the CO signal frequency the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>opacity</b> is appreciable, mostly due to molecular oxygen and water vapor, and corrections to the observed line intensities for signal attenuation must be applied. Kutner's two-layer {{model of the}} atmosphere parameterizes the elevation dependence of the correction factor in terms of only 3 parameters, {{each of which has}} a physical interpretation. Because oxygen has a much greater scale height than water vapor, the model assumes they can be considered separate layers, oxygen above water, with different characteristic temperatures and opacities. The temperature and opacity of oxygen in the upper atmosphere do not vary much seasonally and are assumed to be constant at 255 K and 0.378, respectively, at the signal frequency. The remaining parameters in the model, the temperature and opacity of water and the fraction of the received power from the sky, are determined through antenna tippings (measurements of the intensity of the sky signal as a function of elevation) at least once per six-hour observing shift, and more frequently if the weather is changing. Typical zenith water opacities ranged from 0.10 to 0.15, with values as low as about 0.05 in the coldest, driest weather.

40|$|Here we {{introduce}} the RobERt (Robotic Exoplanet Recognition) algorithm for {{the classification of}} exoplanetary emission spectra. Spectral retrievals of exoplanetary atmospheres frequently requires the preselection of molecular/atomic opacities to be defined by the user. In the era of open-source, automated and self-sufficient retrieval algorithms, manual input should be avoided. User dependent input could, in worst case scenarios, lead to incomplete models and biases in the retrieval. The RobERt algorithm is based on deep belief neural (DBN) networks trained to accurately recognise molecular signatures {{for a wide range}} of planets, atmospheric thermal profiles and compositions. Reconstructions of the learned features, also referred to as `dreams' of the network, indicate good convergence and an accurate representation of molecular features in the DBN.

40|$|More {{than two}} dozen short-period Jupiter-mass gas giant planets have been {{discovered}} around nearby solar-type stars in recent years, several of which undergo transits, making them ideal for the detection and characterization of their atmospheres. Here we adopt a three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical numerical scheme to simulate atmospheric circulation on close-in gas giant planets. In contrast to the conventional GCM and shallow water algorithms, this method does not assume quasi hydrostatic equilibrium and it approximates radiation transfer from optically thin to thick regions with flux-limited diffusion. In the first paper of this series, we consider synchronously-spinning gas giants. We show that a full three-dimensional treatment, coupled with rotationally modified flows and an accurate treatment of radiation, yields a clear temperature transition at the terminator. Based {{on a series of}} numerical simulations with varying opacities, we show that the night-side temperature is a strong indicator of the opacity of the planetary atmosphere. Planetary atmospheres that maintain large, interstellar opacities will exhibit large day-night temperature differences, while planets with reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>opacities</b> due to extensive grain growth and sedimentation will exhibit much more uniform temperatures throughout their photosphere’s.
