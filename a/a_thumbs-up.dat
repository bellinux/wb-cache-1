500|$|Ryan Brockington from New York Post lauded the song, writing [...] "it’s a very surprising, and {{somewhat}} brilliant, apology track where Taylor sings about wishing {{to fix a}} relationship she wished she wouldn't have ruined in the first place." [...] His point was echoed by Rudy Klapper from Sputnikmusic, who described the song as a [...] "regret-filled apology". Stephen M. Deusner from Engine 145 gave the song <b>a</b> <b>thumbs-up</b> and praised Swift as [...] "an expressive singer", calling the song [...] "a dark fantasy of apology and reconciliation" [...] which is [...] "a true heartbreaker". Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded {{the production of the}} song as [...] "B", complimenting the lyrics in particular, by writing [...] "it’s always a good sign when there’s a line as memorable as that one, the kind that lingers around in your head more than the song itself." [...] He also added that he [...] "appreciate(s) the restrained vocal, though a more varied melody would’ve made the chorus quite a bit more distinctive." ...|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Allison Stewart of The Washington Post called the song [...] "great and gooey", {{saying that it}} sounded like [...] "Bryan Adams teaming with Heart in 1984 for a contribution to some alternate universe Footloose soundtrack." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 gave the song <b>a</b> <b>thumbs-up,</b> calling the song as [...] "a dramatic affair that demonstrates how pop and country can intersect {{with each other and}} offer decent results." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] ""Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] would be a suitable fit for a Foreigner or Whitesnake album, and, though nowhere near a classic, it’s an instant entrant into the [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] category." [...] Reviewing the album for Billboard, Gary Graff described the song as being part of an [...] "array of such bittersweet, emotionally ambivalent goodbye songs". Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave the song three-and-a-half stars out of five and praised both Aldean and Clarkson's fine voice, [...] "making for an interesting combination: Jason's rough, slightly nasal voice against Kelly's cleaner, forceful tone." [...] In a different perspective, Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded the production of the song as [...] "C", lambasting the song for its musical element, writing [...] "the sheer volume of noise that invades the track with the first chorus takes us straight into Monster Ballads territory." [...] He concluded his review by emphasizing that [...] "this isn’t country music. It just isn’t." ...|$|E

500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{said that}} the lack of the writing staff in the second season was [...] "disappointing". He [...] "love how this show is about NBC and really set at NBC", but was worried about the misuse of guest stars. Robert Canning of IGN said that for the first time, Jenna's storyline was the [...] "most {{entertaining}} of the night". He felt that first half of the episode was [...] "tightly written and very funny", but the second half [...] "waned a bit, with less than stellar conclusions to the stories and far less funny bits". Canning said that Jack's storyline was the [...] "most disappointing", and hoped that future guest stars were used properly, rather than for the sake of having a name guest star. George Freitag of BuddyTV said that although Tracy was [...] "not as strong as the previous two episodes", he was [...] "still terrific and the nod to his old SNL skit was a nice touch". He felt {{that the lack of}} focus on the personal life of Liz seemed to give the series [...] "a lack of focus". Freitag hoped that her private issues would be further explored, as [...] "her approachable yet successful persona {{was one of the main}} draws to the series in the first place". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that the episode [...] "fell a bit flat", and that the season lacked the other TGSers, Lonny, Frank, Twofer and [...] "director guy". He did not enjoy Jack's storyline, but said that Jenna's storyline [...] "ultimately won <b>a</b> <b>thumbs-up</b> from me for her getting turned on by Kenneth's rudeness".|$|E

In [...] "Rosebud" [...] and [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", he needed {{a great deal of}} effort to wrench items from Maggie. He has difficulty performing such simple actions as giving <b>a</b> <b>thumbs-up,</b> and crushing an insect by stepping on it, or using a door-knocker. [...] In one instance, when he is told to jump out of his burning mansion onto a life net, he drops at the speed of a feather and floats onto some power lines and is electrified. He pitched the opening baseball at a game in [...] "Dancin' Homer", but was only able to throw it a small distance, which drew mocking laughter from the crowd. When Mr. Burns joined Homer's bowling team in [...] "Team Homer", he was barely able to roll the ball down the lane. In season five's [...] "Burns' Heir", Smithers puts a sponge on Mr. Burns' head before leaving the bathroom, causing him to nearly drown in the tub from its weight.

2500|$|John Murphy of musicOMH {{positively}} {{reviewed the}} single as follows: [...] "First single 'Rock Steady' {{is a good}} example of how at ease All Saints sound with their skanking new direction. It feels fresh and cool, and the backing vocals from the Appleton sisters fit in beautifully." [...] Matthew Chisling of Allmusic described the song as a [...] "kicking track" [...] and [...] "solid dance hit with enticing grooves". M. H. Lo of Stylus Magazine gave the track a nine out of ten rating, saying: [...] "With a brilliantly insistent chorus, a backing track that deftly weaves a ska rhythm around a kind of breakbeat, the song will not leave your mind as long as you're willing to give it three spins. The golden age of British girl bands receives reinforcements." [...] Hamish Champ of Virgin Media mentioned in a review of Studio 1: [...] "From the opener, 'Rock Steady', one can't help feeling that the quartet has made a conscious decision to move into Girls Aloud territory." [...] Leon McDermott of the Sunday Herald also gave the single <b>a</b> <b>thumbs-up,</b> saying: [...] "An updated take on the sound they made their own, it adds cheeky nods to Jamaican-inspired two tone, ska and rock steady the genre that provides the title for their skanking, jumping comeback single." [...] Adrian Thrill of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the song: [...] "New single 'Rock Steady' finds their voices blending brilliantly over a backdrop of rimshot drumming and heavy, dubby bass." [...] Malcolm Mackenzie of The London Paper said [...] "Rock Steady" [...] is [...] "girly ska pop reminiscent of early Bananarama and [...] Lily Allen." ...|$|E

[...] The Winnipeg Free Press was mixed in their review, stating [...] "I can't really give Black Bridge <b>a</b> big <b>thumbs-up,</b> but I can throw {{it a few}} devil-horns for the crazed fervour with which it descends into high school headbanging culture, circa 1984." ...|$|R
40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common neurodevelopmental disorders. Although not a {{diagnostic}} feature, motor impairments have been recently acknowledged as prevalent and significant, such that these children have difficulties planning, organizing and coordinating movements. This study aimed to further investigate anticipatory motor planning in children with ASD by means of assessing end- and beginning-state comfort, considering inconsistent reports of end-state comfort in independent action, and the study of beginning-state comfort being limited to one study with young adults. Five- to 11 -year-old children with ASD, and chronologically age- and sex matched typically-developing children picked-up a glass and (1) poured a cup of water; and (2) passed it to the researcher to pour a cup of water. End-state comfort was deemed evident if participants grasped the glass thumb-down followed by a 180 ° rotation; therefore ending with <b>a</b> <b>thumb-up</b> posture. Beginning-state comfort was deemed evident if participants passed the glass to the researcher oriented upright. Findings revealed less end-state comfort in children with ASD, attributed to motor planning deficits. Beginning-state comfort did not differ, ascribed to the habitual nature of the task; therefore reflecting a stimulus-driven response as opposed to an action which reflects anticipatory planning. Findings support difficulties with motor planning and control for children with ASD in an independent task. However, when acting with a familiar object in joint action, behaviour does not differ, likely indicative of a habitual, stimulus-driven response...|$|R

Both teams' original Christmas songs and the music videos were played over the other's house. Deniesse and Divine commented on how soothing Wayuk's song was. Unad and the others had issues with the supposed lack of originality in High-Voltage's song. After Seth and Erica were evicted, Big Brother informed the housemates that the two will be the last evictees for the year.

Among his wins was a dominant performance in the 1989 Indianapolis 500 where he led 158 of 200 laps and won by 2 laps, but only after a dramatic duel with Al Unser, Jr. in the closing laps of the race. With both drivers a commanding six laps ahead of third place Raul Boesel, Unser ran down Fittipaldi after a late-race restart and passed him for the lead on lap 196. Three laps later, Fittipaldi used lapped traffic to his advantage to pull alongside Unser on the backstretch. Neither driver would give way, and the two cars touched wheels as they went through turn three side by side.
