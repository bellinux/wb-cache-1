50|$|Regulations {{governing}} the required thrust levels for transport aircraft are typically {{based upon the}} requirement that an aircraft {{be able to continue}} a takeoff if an engine fails after the takeoff decision speed is reached. Thus, with <b>all</b> <b>engines</b> <b>operating,</b> trijets must be able to produce at least 150% of the minimum thrust required to climb and quad-jets 133%. Conversely, since a twinjet will lose half of its total thrust if an engine fails, they are required to produce 200% of the minimum thrust required to climb when both engines are operating. Because of this, twinjets will typically have higher thrust-to-weight ratios than aircraft with three or more engines and are thus able to accelerate and climb faster.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In an {{electro-mechanical}} valve actuated engine, solenoid actuators {{drive the}} valves that control airflow into the cylinders, allowing {{elimination of the}} camshaft and flexible control of the valve timing. Individual control of the valves provides flexibility in valve timing over <b>all</b> <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> conditions and fully enables the benefits of variable valve timing. This paper describes a closed-loop preview control of an electromechanical valve actuator that achieves quiet, robust, and reliable operation {{in the presence of}} significant delays in electromagnetic system associated with eddy current losses. In this case, the desired trajectory of the armature position is known apriori. It is well know that preview control can greatly enhance disturbance rejection and tracking performance, when future information about the desired output is available.

40|$|It is {{apparent}} that all fluid flows behave in a transient manner, particularly with fluid flows across turbomachinery blade rows. In a turbofan engine, the transient flow behavior across the fan blades is a primary impetus for the generation of work done by the system so that successful operation is achieved by the engine [7]. The current methods in determining whether the flow is steady or transient around the fan at each operating condition for industrial applications are efficient because they reduce complexities and satisfy the need for quick, economical solutions. These methods however {{are more likely to}} depict an incomplete perspective of the flow physics around the fan, since the flow field is always transient at <b>all</b> <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> conditions, even for cases where the flow field is classified as steady-state. A proposed solution is to develop a strategy that presents a realistic scope of transient flow effects across fan blades in a turbofan engine. The objective in the present research is to investigate the transient flow behavior around an isolated fan stage when the turbofan <b>engine</b> <b>operates</b> from choked to stall conditions at three representative near-tip blade speeds. Finally, the research serves to establish a classification of flow behavior ranging from a small degree to a substantial degree of unsteadiness with respect to the overall performance of a turbofan engine. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{low-pressure}} hydrogen direct-injection {{system has}} been developed that is characterised by low storage residual pressure (~ 12 bar) and simple mechanical solutions. The injection is split in two steps. Firstly hydrogen is metered and admitted into a small intermediate chamber. by an electro-injector (a conventional one for CNG application). Next, a mechanically-actuated poppet valve times hydrogen injection from the intermediate chamber to the cylinder, allowing higher flow rate than any electro-injector. Injection must finish early enough to permit achieving good charge homogeneity, anyhow before in-cylinder pressure growth stops hydrogen entry, and must not start before intake valve closing to avoid backfire. A prototype has been realised modifying a single-cylinder 650 cm 3 production engine with three intake valves of which the central one {{has been replaced by}} the valve for hydrogen injection. Prototype design complies with the results of a previous CFD activity during which hydrogen injection in a quiescent, constant volume through poppet valves of different shapes was simulated in order to investigate how valve and seat-valve geometries act upon fuel-air mixing.

40|$|In {{order to}} comply with the exhaust {{emission}} regulations that are becoming more severe every year, more advanced engine control is necessary. Engine engineers are concerned about the Hydrocarbons (HCs) that flow through the air-intake ports and that are difficult to precisely control. The main sources of such HCs are; the canister purge, PCV, and back-flow gas through the intake valves. And the Air/Fuel ratio (A/F) may be aggravated when such HCs flow into the combustion chambers. The influence that HCs have on the A/F may even increase further due to the; increasingly stringent EVAP emission regulations, more effective ventilation in the crankcase, and growth of the VVT-operated angle and timing. In order to more precisely control the A/F, it is important to estimate the amount of HCs that are difficult to manage, and seek suitable controls over fuel injection, etc. Therefore, the authors have developed a HC concentration measuring technology of the air-intake system using FID (of which the gas sampling performance has been significantly improved).

The pintle-type outwards opening injector {{has the potential}} to address and overcome many of the typical problems related to close-spacing, spray-guided configurations owing to its hollow cone spray, exhibiting better air utilization than multihole sprays, with good penetration during early injection, and a spray angle almost independent of cylinder backpressure. The three prototype injectors have different nozzle exit geometries for optimization of spray stability under <b>all</b> <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. The emerging fuel sprays for both single- and double-injection operation were visualized using Mie scattering and a high-speed CCD camera.

From these images, a spray angle analysis was performed by comparing the mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum cone angle under different operating conditions; the spray stability was quantified by analysing the mean and RMS images and the mean and RMS spray cone angles.

The TEG device is built from commercially available materials for the sake of possible economical application. Two types of commercial TEM (thermo electric module) have been studied separately on the test rig.

An open circuit water cooling system is used to replicate the sea water cold source. The characterization tests showed that the silicium-germanium alloys TEM proved a remarkable reliability on <b>all</b> <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> points, with no significant deterioration of performance even under sever variation in the hot source conditions.

40|$|This {{research}} performs {{an experimental}} study of a trailing edge blowing system that can adapt to variations in flow parameters and reduce the unsteady stator-rotor interaction at <b>all</b> <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. The fan rotor of a 1 / 14 scale turbofan propulsion simulator is subjected to spatially periodic, circumferential inlet flow distortions. The distortions are generated by four struts that support a centerbody in the inlet mounted onto the simulator. To reduce the unsteady effects of the strut wakes on the rotor blades, the wake is re-energized by injecting mass from {{the trailing edge of}} the strut. Each strut is provided with discrete blowing holes that open out through the strut trailing edge. Each blowing hole is connected to a MEMS based microvalve, which controls the blowing rate of the hole. The microvalve is actuated by a signal voltage, generated by a PID controller that accepts free stream and wake axial flow velocities as inputs and minimzes their difference. To quantify the effectiveness of trailing edge blowing the far-field noise is measured in an anechoic chamber. The experiments are performed for two simulator test speeds, 29, 500 rpm and 40, 000 rpm, with and without trailing edge blowing.
