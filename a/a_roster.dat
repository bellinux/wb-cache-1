Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere.

5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it.

Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on <b>a</b> <b>roster.</b> During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E
