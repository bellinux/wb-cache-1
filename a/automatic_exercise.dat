40|$|A {{computer}} based training tool has been developed for Signals and Systems undergraduate course students. It consists in an <b>automatic</b> <b>exercise</b> generator and an automatic self assessment system {{that can be used}} by the students as many times as they want. The students use the tool to generate numerical variation of the problem, they solve it and afterword use again the tool to answer a series of questions that are automatically assessed. The proposed problem comprised a continuous time domain characterization of a linear and time invariant system and its Fourier domain and Laplace domain analysis. The <b>automatic</b> <b>exercise</b> generator is based on a simple algorithm that varies the parameters that defined the exercise in a controlled way, so the students can be trained to analyze different kind of first and second order filters. The proposed algorithm requires only an arbitrary input number to generate a new exercise. More than 2000 numerically different exercises are automatically generated and assessed. This tool can also be used as a {{computer based}} assessment system when used in an environment that guarantees the identification of the student. When used as assessment system, it has the advantage that the teacher can select the difficulty of the exercise (all the student are required to analyze the same order and type filter but with different parameters, so the cheating is quite difficult). The algorithm can be easily transferred to almost any kind of problem in Signal and Systems and other engineering disciplines...|$|E

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{systematic}} review was to summarize, structure and evaluate the findings on <b>automatic</b> evaluations of <b>exercising.</b> Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported measuring <b>automatic</b> evaluations of <b>exercising</b> with an implicit measure and assessed some kind of exercise variable. Fourteen nonexperimental and six experimental studies (out of a total N = 1, 928) were identified and rated by two independent reviewers. The main study characteristics were extracted and the grade of evidence for each study evaluated. First, results revealed a large heterogeneity in the applied measures to assess <b>automatic</b> evaluations of <b>exercising</b> and the exercise variables. Generally, small to large-sized significant relations between <b>automatic</b> evaluations of <b>exercising</b> and exercise variables were identified {{in the vast majority}} of studies. The review offers a systematization of the various examined exercise variables and prompts to differentiate more carefully between actually observed exercise behavior (proximal exercise indicator) and associated physiological or psychological variables (distal exercise indicator). Second, a lack of transparent reported reflections on the differing theoretical basis leading to the use of specific implicit measures was observed. Implicit measures should be applied purposefully, taking into consideration the individual advantages or disadvantages of the measures. Third, 12 studies were rated as providing first-grade evidence (lowest grade of evidence), five represent second-grade and three were rated as third-grade evidence. There is a dramatic lack of experimental studies, which are essential for illustrating the cause-effect relation between <b>automatic</b> evaluations of <b>exercising</b> and exercise and investigating under which conditions <b>automatic</b> evaluations of <b>exercising</b> influence behavior. Conclusions about the necessity of exercise interventions targeted at the alteration of <b>automatic</b> evaluations of <b>exercising</b> should therefore not be drawn too hastily...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{valuation}} formulas for {{several types of}} American options on two or more assets. Our contribution is twofold. First, we characterize the optimal exercise regions and provide valuation formulas {{for a number of}} American option contracts on multiple underlying assets with convex payoff functions. Examples include options on the maximum of two assets, dual strike options, spread options, exchange options, options on the product and powers of the product, and options on the arithmetic average of two assets. Second, we derive results for American option contracts with nonconvex payoffs, such as American capped exchange options. For this option we explicitly identify the optimal exercise boundary and provide a decomposition of the price in terms of a capped exchange option with <b>automatic</b> <b>exercise</b> at the cap and an early exercise premium involving the benefits of exercising prior to reaching the cap. Besides generalizing the current literature on American option valuation our analysis has implications for the theory of investment under uncertainty. A specialization of one of our models also provides a new representation formula for an American capped option on a single underlying asset. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Inc. 1997. ...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of ICCE 2002 International Conference on Computers in Education 3 - 6 December 2002; Auckland, New ZealandWith {{increasing}} {{access to}} the Internet and the wealth of material online, a Web-based self-teaching system has considerable educational value. Accordingly, we developed AEGIS (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Exercise</b> Generator based on the Intelligence of Students), which automatically generates questions whose difficulty level fits the achievement level of a student. However, it was implicitly assumed that all the questions were already categorized according to their subjects. In practice, {{this is not the}} case, but it is unreasonable (because of time and cost) to expect teachers to categorize each question into a suitable subject domain. Therefore, we need a method for categorizing questions automatically according to specified teaching concepts. This paper presents an automatic question categorization mechanism according to both a list of teaching concepts, called a Navigation List (NaviList for short), and the meaning of questions. We define an XML tag called a CONCEPT tag, which indicates a concept in a question, and an ontology, which is a hierarchical cluster of concepts. The method uses the tags and the ontology to categorize questions, based on the similarity between each category in a NaviList pre-composed by a teacher and an ontological concept specified by a CONCEPT tag in a question...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a forced non-electric-shock running wheel (FNESRW) system that provides rats with high-intensity exercise training using <b>automatic</b> <b>exercise</b> training patterns that {{are controlled by}} a microcontroller. The proposed system successfully makes a breakthrough in the traditional motorized running wheel to allow rats to perform high-intensity training and to enable comparisons with the treadmill at the same exercise intensity without any electric shock. A polyvinyl chloride runway with a rough rubber surface was coated {{on the periphery of}} the wheel so as to permit automatic acceleration training, and which allowed the rats to run consistently at high speeds (30 m/min for 1 h). An animal ischemic stroke model was used to validate the proposed system. FNESRW, treadmill, control, and sham groups were studied. The FNESRW and treadmill groups underwent 3 weeks of endurance running training. After 3 weeks, the experiments of middle cerebral artery occlusion, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), an inclined plane test, and triphenyltetrazolium chloride were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed platform. The proposed platform showed that enhancement of motor function, mNSS, and infarct volumes was significantly stronger in the FNESRW group than the control group (P< 0. 05) and similar to the treadmill group. The experimental data demonstrated that the proposed platform can be applied to test the benefit of exercise-preconditioning-induced neuroprotection using the animal stroke model. Additional advantages of the FNESRW system include stand-alone capability, independence of subjective human adjustment, and ease of use...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{levels of}} international communication {{in all aspects}} of life lead to a growing demand of language skills. Traditional language courses compete nowadays {{with a wide range of}} online offerings that promise higher flexibility. However, most platforms provide rather static educational content and do not yet incorporate the recent progress in educational natural language processing. In the last years, many researchers developed new methods for <b>automatic</b> <b>exercise</b> generation, but the generated output is often either too easy or too difficult to be used with real learners. In this thesis, we address the task of predicting and manipulating the difficulty of text-completion exercises based on measurable linguistic properties to bridge the gap between technical ambition and educational needs. The main contribution consists of a theoretical model and a computational implementation for exercise difficulty prediction on the item level. This is the first automatic approach that reaches human performance levels and is applicable to various languages and exercise types. The exercises in this thesis differ with respect to the exercise content and the exercise format. As theoretical basis for the thesis, we develop a new difficulty model that combines content and format factors and further distinguishes the dimensions of text difficulty, word difficulty, candidate ambiguity, and item dependency. It is targeted at text-completion exercises that are a common method for fast language proficiency tests. The empirical basis for the thesis consists of five difficulty datasets containing exercises annotated with learner performance data. The difficulty is expressed as the ratio of learners who fail to solve the exercise. In order to predict the difficulty for unseen exercises, we implement the four dimensions of the model as computational measures. For each dimension, the thesis contains the discussion and implementation of existing measures, the development of new approaches, and an experimental evaluation on sub-tasks. In particular, we developed new approaches for the tasks of cognate production, spelling difficulty prediction, and candidate ambiguity evaluation. For the main experiments, the individual measures are combined into an machine learning approach to predict the difficulty of C-tests, X-tests and cloze tests in English, German, and French. The performance of human experts on the same task is determined by conducting an annotation study to provide a basis for comparison. The quality of the automatic prediction reaches the levels of human accuracy for the largest datasets. If we can predict the difficulty of exercises, we are able to manipulate the difficulty. We develop a new approach for exercise generation and selection that is based on the prediction model. It reaches high acceptance ratings by human users and can be directly integrated into real-world scenarios. In addition, the measures for word difficulty and candidate ambiguity are used to improve the tasks of content and distractor manipulation. Previous work for exercise difficulty was commonly limited to manual correlation analyses using learner results. The computational approach of this thesis makes it possible to predict the difficulty of text-completion exercises in advance. This is an important contribution towards the goal of completely automated exercise generation for language learning...|$|E
40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} was to examine how self-efficacy, explicit exercise motives and implicit <b>automatic</b> associations with <b>exercise</b> influence exercise behaviour of sedentary adults. This dissertation {{is divided into three}} manuscripts. The first manuscript examined how self-selection influences the decision to enrol in an exercise program as well as in self-efficacy, explicit motives and implicit associations. Additionally, manuscript one sought to understand the role of self-selection bias in the adoption and maintenance of exercise over six months. A total of 290 inactive adults aged 35 - 65 completed the Multidimensional Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale (MSES; Rodgers, Wilson, Hall, Fraser, 2 ̆ 6 Murray, 2008), two Go/No Go Association Tasks (GNATs; Nosek 2 ̆ 6 Banaji, 2001) to measure automatically activated associations of exercise, and the Exercise Motivations Inventory- 2 (EMI- 2; Markland 2 ̆ 6 Ingledew, 1997) at baseline, three months and six months of an exercise program. Analysis of variance was used to test study hypotheses. At baseline, participants were grouped into three self-selection profiles: self-selection (n = 126), self-selection with previous knowledge of the exercise program (n = 111), {{and those who did not}} enrol in the exercise program (n = 53). Those in the self-selection groups had higher task, coping and scheduling SE, as well positive health exercise motives. No differences in implicit <b>automatic</b> associations with <b>exercise</b> were found. The influence of self-selection bias did not influence adherence or drop outs at three and six months across the three dependent variables. Manuscript two investigated the role that self-efficacy, explicit motives and implicit <b>automatic</b> associations with <b>exercise</b> influence the intention behaviour gap. Those participants who enrolled in the exercise program and had no previous knowledge of the exercise program were included in this study resulting in a total of 141 participants (107 inclined actors and 35 inclined abstainers) aged 35 - 65. Analysis of variance, logistic regression, and moderation models were used to examine hypotheses. SE beliefs, explicit motives or implicit <b>automatic</b> associations with <b>exercise</b> did not differentiate inclined actors and abstainers. Coping SE was a significant predictor of being an inclined actor. Explicit weight management and appearance motives moderated the relationship between SE and becoming an inclined actor. The purpose of Manuscript 3 was to examine how self-efficacy, explicit exercise motives and implicit automatic associations change over the course of a six-month exercise program as a function of exercise type (weight training or aerobic training). A total of 141 (aged 35 - 65) began the exercise program and were included in this manuscript. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess change over time. Implicit associations did not change over time. Explicit motives, except weight management motives significantly decreased from baseline to six months and from three months to six months. The change in appearance motives was stronger for those in the strength-training group. Task, coping and scheduling SE increased from baseline and remained stable except for task SE, which, decreased from three to six months...|$|R

REAP. PT is a project emerging from this new field, aiming to teach Portuguese in an innovative and appealing way, and adapted to each student. In this paper, we present a new improvement of the REAP. PT system, consisting in developing new, automatically generated, syntactic exercises. These exercises deal with the complex phenomenon of pronominalization, that is, the substitution of a syntactic constituent with an adequate pronominal form. Though the transformation may seem simple, it involves complex lexical, syntactical and semantic constraints. The issues on pronominalization in Portuguese make it a particularly difficult aspect of language learning for non-native speakers. On the other hand, even native speakers can often be uncertain about the correct clitic positioning, due to the complexity and interaction of competing factors governing this phenomenon. A new architecture for <b>automatic</b> syntactic <b>exercise</b> generation is proposed. It proved invaluable in easing {{the development of this}} complex exercise, and is expected to make a relevant step forward in the development of future syntactic exercises, with the potential of becoming a syntactic exercise generation framework.

Participants (N = 90) completed a response time categorization task (similar to the implicit association test) to capture how automatically people perceived each image as relevant to Exercise or Not exercise. Participants also self-reported their evaluations of the images using visual analog scales with the anchors: Exercise/Not exercise, Does not motivate me to exercise/Motivates me to exercise, Pleasant/Unpleasant, and Energizing/Deactivating. People tended to more strongly automatically associate images with exercise if the images were of an outdoor setting, presented sport (as opposed to active labor or gym-based) activities, and included young (as opposed to middle-aged) adults. People tended to reflectively find images of young adults more motivating and relevant to exercise than images of older adults.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigate}} {{practical and}} theoretical issues surrounding {{the use of}} natural language processing technology {{in the context of}} Russian Computer-Assisted Language-Learning, with particular emphasis on morphological analysis. In Part I, I present linguistic and practical issues surrounding the development and evaluation of two foundational technologies: a two-level morphological analyzer, and a constraint grammar to contextually disambiguate homonymy in the analyzer’s output. The analyzer was specially designed for L 2 learner applications—with stress annotation and rule-based morphosyntactic disambiguation—and it is competitive with state-of-the-art Russian analyzers. The constraint grammar is designed to have high recall, allowing an L 2 -learner application to base decisions on all possible readings, and not just the single most likely reading. The constraint grammar resolves 44 % of the ambiguity output by the morphological analyzer. A voting setup combining the constraint grammar with a trigram hidden markov model tagger demonstrates how a high-recall grammar can boost performance of probabilistic taggers, which are better suited to capturing highly idiosyncratic facts about collocational tendencies. In Part II, I present linguistic, theoretical, practical issues surrounding the application of the morphological analyzer and constraint grammar to three real-life computer-assisted language-learning tasks: automatic stress annotation, <b>automatic</b> grammar <b>exercise</b> generation from authentic texts, and automatic evaluation of text readability. The automatic stress placement task is vital for Russian language-learning applications. The morphological analyzer and constraint grammar yield state-of-the-art results, resolving 42 % of stress ambiguity in a corpus of running text. In order to demonstrate the value of a high-recall constraint grammar, I developed Russian grammar activities for the VIEW platform, a system for providing automatic Visual Input Enhancement of Web documents. This system allows teachers and learners to automatically generate grammatical highlighting, identification activities, multiple-choice activities, and fill-in-the-blank activities, enabling them to study grammar using texts that are interesting or relevant to them. I show that the morphological analysis described above is instrumental not only for generating exercises, but also for providing adaptive feedback, a feature which typically requires encoding specific learner language features. A final test-case for morphological analysis in Russian language-learning is automatic readability assessment, which can help learners and teachers find texts at appropriate reading levels. I show that features based on morphology are among the most informative for L 2 readability assessment...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{e-learning}} environments {{is the possibility of}} creating and evaluating exercises. However, the lack of tools supporting the authoring and <b>automatic</b> checking of <b>exercises</b> for specifics topics (e. g., geometry) drastically reduces advantages in the use of e-learning environments on a larger scale, as usually happens in Brazil. This paper describes an algorithm, and a tool based on it, designed for the authoring and automatic checking of geometry exercises. The algorithm dynamically compares the distances between the geometric objects of the student`s solution and the template`s solution, provided by the author of the exercise. Each solution is a geometric construction which is considered a function receiving geometric objects (input) and returning other geometric objects (output). Thus, for a given problem, if we know one function (construction) that solves the problem, we can compare it to any other function to check whether they are equivalent or not. Two functions are equivalent if, and only if, they have the same output when the same input is applied. If the student`s solution is equivalent to the template`s solution, then we consider the student`s solution as a correct solution. Our software utility provides both authoring and checking tools to work directly on the Internet, together with learning management systems. These tools are implemented using the dynamic geometry software, iGeom, which has been used in a geometry course since 2004 and has a successful track record in the classroom. Empowered with these new features, iGeom simplifies teachers` tasks, solves non-trivial problems in student solutions and helps to increase student motivation by providing feedback in real time.

40|$|The {{skill of}} {{programming}} {{is a key}} asset for every computer science student. Many {{studies have shown that}} this is a hard skill to learn and the outcomes of programming courses have often been substandard. Thus, a range of methods and tools have been developed to assist students’ learning processes. One of the biggest fields in computer science education is the use of visualizations as a learning aid and many visualization based tools have been developed to aid the learning process during last few decades. Studies conducted in this thesis focus on two different visualizationbased tools TRAKLA 2 and ViLLE. This thesis includes results from multiple empirical studies about what kind of effects the introduction and usage of these tools have on students’ opinions and performance, and what kind of implications there are from a teacher’s point of view. The results from studies in this thesis show that students preferred to do web-based exercises, and felt that those exercises contributed to their learning. The usage of the tool motivated students to work harder during their course, which was shown in overall course performance and drop-out statistics. We have also shown that visualization-based tools can be used to enhance the learning process, and one of the key factors is the higher and active level of engagement (see. Engagement Taxonomy by Naps et al., 2002). The automatic grading accompanied with immediate feedback helps students to overcome obstacles during the learning process, and to grasp the key element in the learning task. These kinds of tools can help us to cope with the fact that many programming courses are overcrowded with limited teaching resources. These tools allows us to tackle this problem by utilizing <b>automatic</b> assessment in <b>exercises</b> that are most suitable {{to be done in the}} web (like tracing and simulation) since its supports students’ independent learning regardless of time and place. In summary, we can use our course’s resources more efficiently to increase the quality of the learning experience of the students and the teaching experience of the teacher, and even increase performance of the students. There are also methodological results from this thesis which contribute to developing insight into the conduct of empirical evaluations of new tools or techniques. When we evaluate a new tool, especially one accompanied with visualization, we need to give a proper introduction to it and to the graphical notation used by tool. The standard procedure should also include capturing the screen with audio to confirm that the participants of the experiment are doing what they are supposed to do. By taken such measures in the study of the learning impact of visualization support for learning, we can avoid drawing false conclusion from our experiments. As computer science educators, we face two important challenges. Firstly, we need to start to deliver the message in our own institution and all over the world about the new – scientifically proven – innovations in teaching like TRAKLA 2 and ViLLE. Secondly, we have the relevant experience of conducting teaching related experiment, and thus we can support our colleagues to learn essential know-how of the research based improvement of their teaching. This change can transform academic teaching into publications and by utilizing this approach we can significantly increase the adoption of the new tools and techniques, and overall increase the knowledge of best-practices. In future, we need to combine our forces and tackle these universal and common problems together by creating multi-national and multiinstitutional research projects. We need to create a community and a platform in which we can share these best practices and at the same time conduct multi-national research projects easily...|$|R
