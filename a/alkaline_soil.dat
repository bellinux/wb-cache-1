5|$|Stropharia caerulea is a {{saprophytic}} fungus that fruits singly or in groups. It {{grows in}} or on meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. In Europe {{it is often}} found in beech woods in <b>alkaline</b> <b>soil.</b> It is a common species found throughout Europe, where it fruits from July to November.

5|$|B.epica {{is fairly}} new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in loamy clay or sandy gravel. It showed good {{tolerance}} for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, <b>alkaline</b> <b>soil</b> near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly <b>alkaline</b> <b>soil</b> and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Alkaline</b> <b>soils</b> are soils (mostly clay soils) {{with a high}} pH (> 9) and a {{poor soil}} {{structure}} and a low infiltration capacity. The are not saline, i. e. {{the total amount of}} soluble soils, especially sodium chlorides, is not excessive (ECe < 4 to 8 dS/m). Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0. 5 to 1 m. depth. Causes The causes of soil alkalinity are natural or they can be man-made. The natural development is due to the presence soil minerals producing sodium carbonate upon whethering. The man-made development is due to the application of irrigation water (surface or ground water) containg a relatively high proportion of sodium bicarbonates) Where The extent of <b>alkaline</b> <b>soils</b> is not precisely known.

25|$|While the {{possibility}} of carbonates on Mars has been {{of great interest to}} exobiologists and geochemists alike, there was little evidence for significant quantities of carbonate deposits on the surface.

2500|$|Liquidambar styraciflua is {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} and forestal tree, cultivated for its distinctive foliage and intense autumn colors.

2500|$|The Bidni, {{which is}} also {{referred}} to as Bitni, is an olive cultivar from the Mediterranean island of Malta. The fruit is small in size, and is renowned for its superior oil which is thought to be low in acidity.

As an indigenous olive cultivar, the Bidni has developed a unique DNA profile, and is believed to be among the most ancient species on the island, triggering local authorities to declare some of these ancient trees as [...] "national monuments", a status which is enjoyed by only a handful of other species.|$|E

2500|$|The Blue Mountain Basins {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by flat to rolling alluvial valleys containing floodplains, fluvial terraces, and scattered buttes in the Wallowa, Grande Ronde, and Baker valleys. The Wallowa Valley also includes outwash terraces, moraines, and a low elevation basalt plateau. Elevation varies from 2,600to5,000feet (792to1,524m). All three valleys are faultbounded grabens or depressions filled with sediments. The Wallowa and Grande Ronde valleys have a marine-moderated climate and moisture-retaining loess soils. The Baker Valley, located in the rain shadow of the Elkhorn Mountains, is drier and has areas of <b>alkaline</b> <b>soil.</b> All three valleys receive stream flow from the surrounding mountains. Most of the floodplain wetlands have been drained for agriculture, but a remnant exists in the Grande Ronde Basin at the Ladd Marsh state wildlife area. The Baker Valley features sagebrush steppe composed of Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue. The Wallowa and Grande Ronde valleys features grassland containing bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue. Wetlands support tufted hairgrass, sedges, basin wildrye, and black greasewood.
