40|$|The world {{population}} is growing fast {{and what we}} all have in common here on earth {{is that we need}} food to survive. Väderstad AB develops and manufacture machines that make crop production more efficient for today’s farming. This thesis’ purpose was to improve Väderstad AB’s planter Tempo by developing a floating row cleaner for it. At the time this work took place, row cleaners were bought from external manufacturers. The task was to develop an original design which was supposed to be more efficient and have a lower manufacturing cost than the purchase price for the existing product. To make sure that no solutions to the problem were lost, a systematic concept development method were used throughout the project. The achieved results were complete CAD models of the row cleaner’s design. The design was built up by two discs in V-formation suspended by a parallel linkage. The parallel linkage had an <b>adjustable</b> <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> Furthermore, prototypes of the discs for the developed row cleaner was manufactured and tested in the field. Good results were achieved and the shape of the discs could be considered ready for production. It turned out {{that it was possible to}} develop a row cleaner that can handle most conditions. The proportion of standard components and already existing components at the company that were used in the final design was 67, 4 percent. The price of the row cleaner was estimated to 86 percent of the fixed bought one. The alternative solutions that was investigated is also presented in the rapport. Since the project took place during a limited time some parts of the development process were not included. For example, no strength calculations were done, and no drawings were made. Recommendations and material for continued work on the design was handed over to Väderstad AB...|$|E

40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an <b>adjustable</b> <b>spring</b> force on the socket. A locking knob is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|R

30|$|Two main options {{exist to}} {{manipulate}} Eqs. (7) and (8) to meet iso-elasticity and adaptability requirements. These are <b>adjustable</b> <b>spring</b> constants or a novel geometry, respectively. In [16], variable stiffness springs are used, which allows adjustment {{of the point}} of equilibration. The design {{is based on a}} nut with pitch equal to the spring. By changing the location of the nut {{along the length of the}} spring, sections of the spring are inactivated. This is a viable solution if the adjustment can be made while the spring is not elongated. For variable <b>loaded</b> <b>springs</b> (i.e. variable elongated springs), the pitch changes and therefore the adjustment of the stiffness is not easily possible.|$|R

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> rack and pinion. This <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in <b>spring</b> <b>loading.</b> The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R

A rigid bar beneath the center of the instrument is pressed upward by an <b>adjustable</b> <b>spring,</b> and engages a long felt pad against the sharps and the naturals. [...] A foot pedal lowers the bar and allows notes to ring freely; releasing the pedal engages the damper and stops any vibrating notes.|$|R
