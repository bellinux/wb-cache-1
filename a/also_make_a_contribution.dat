5000|$|An oral {{consonant}} is a consonant {{sound in}} speech {{that is made}} by allowing air {{to escape from the}} mouth, as opposed to the nose. To create an intended oral consonant sound, the entire mouth plays a role in modifying the air's passageway. This rapid modification of the air passageway using the tongue and lips makes changes to the waveform of the sound by compressing and expanding the air. In addition to the nose and mouth, the vocal cords and lungs <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>contribution</b> to producing speech by controlling the volume (amplitude) and pitch (frequency) of the sound.

40|$|Abstract: A {{reexamination of}} the Clower-Leijonhufvud {{approach}} to Keynesian theory is presented. Central elements are {{the lack of}} information available to atomistic economic agents in a decentralized environment, and the insistence on multi-period analysis. Such a reexamination is necessary to avoid the currently widespread identification of Keynesian macroeconomics with models of exogenous prices or of non-atomistic agents. The analysis denies the frequent association between Clower and Leijonhufvud and the fix-price method.
