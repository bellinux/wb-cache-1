25|$|Calormenes disparage Narnian poetry, {{contending that}} it is all <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> love and war and not about useful maxims, but when the Calormen-raised Cor and Aravis first hear Narnian (or Cor's native Archenlandish) poetry they find it much more exciting. Calormen also prizes the art of story-telling, which, {{according}} to Lewis, forms part of {{the education of the}} nobility. The talking horse Bree, though not fond of most things Calormene, thoroughly enjoys a story told in Calormene style by Aravis and rolling like inarticulate Calormene horses.|$|E
25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

As Janet sings, Howlett faced a particular acting challenge. She possesses, she explained, [...] "very little {{understanding of what}} constitutes music, and no idea at all <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> keys, pitch or melody – I even struggle {{with the concept of}} 'high' and 'low' sounds". The song Janet sings—"Only You" [...] by Yazoo—was particularly challenging. Howlett sought help from the composer John Chambers, with whom she had previously worked, and with his help, learnt the song's rhythm and then placed the lyrics relative to it. Chambers then produced a [...] "board of 'tune'", with words sung with a high note placed physically higher on the board, and Howlett tried various methods to train herself to sing different pitches. The whole process took a considerable amount of time, but [...] "In the end, it paid off, because I got the role. It {{was one of the best}} and most welcoming sets I've been on, especially in mainstream filming. I never once felt like a token Deaf, which is rare and beautiful." ...|$|E

500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I try not to think <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, {{said he would like to}} try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E

I think 'Teflon' is my favorite because it kind of has that slacker attitude of someone who doesn't vote {{but at the same}} time is giving a fuck. I think a lot of people could maybe understand that." [...] In this same interview, it was pointed out that the introduction of [...] "Halo of Nembutals" [...] contains a sample of a Jeremy Michael Ward recording, dating back to 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, a film {{adaptation}} of Moore's V for Vendetta was released, produced by The Wachowskis {{and directed by}} James McTeigue. Producer Joel Silver said {{at a press conference}} for the Warner Bros.' V for Vendetta that fellow producer Lana Wachowski had talked with Moore, and that [...] " [...] was very excited about what [...] had to say." [...] Moore disputed this, reporting that he told Wachowski [...] "I didn't {{want anything to do with}} films... I wasn't interested in Hollywood," [...] and demanded that DC Comics force Warner Bros to issue a public retraction and apology for Silver's [...] "blatant lies". Although Silver called Moore directly to apologise, no public retraction appeared. Moore was quoted as saying that the comic book had been [...] "specifically <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> fascism and anarchy. Those words, 'fascism' and 'anarchy,' occur nowhere in the film. It's been turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sabbat were {{initially}} labelled as [...] "thrash" [...] and [...] "satanic" [...] in the Midlands metal scene. Fraser Craske: [...] "We're not Satanists. It's more theatrical. We're interested in religion and philosophy and {{it follows that}} we write tracks <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] The band’s early lyrics were [...] "primarily Satanic or [...] influenced by the Occult in some way"; in Walkyier’s interpretation, Satanism [...] "doesn’t say ‘let’s go out and kill people’ or anything like that", referring to The Satanic Bible which has [...] "nothing to do with sacrifice" [...] but with a selfish outlook. Walkyier sees Satanism as a rebellion against orthodox Christianity. As he considers Satan and the Devil to be [...] "in a lots of ways [...] a bogeyman invented by the Christians" [...] to make people follow them, and [...] "started to look more into the old religion of Europe , and that’s sort of where my… my kind of personal beliefs lie really".|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} subsequently drew {{comment from}} the entire band; other than the composer (McCartney), none appear to have fond memories of their work on the song: Lennon said [...] "I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it", adding later [...] "I hate it, 'cos all I remember is the track... did everything {{to make it into}} a single, and it never was and it never could have been." [...] Harrison characterised the song as [...] "fruity" [...] and commented [...] "we spent {{a hell of a lot}} of time on it", and later [...] "after a while, we did a good job on it". Starr added retrospective input on the finished result in a Rolling Stone article from 2008: [...] "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.'
