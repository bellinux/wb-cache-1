5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E

25|$|Attention {{should be}} made to two {{important}} points in these definitions.

25|$|For instance, a {{power factor}} of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 {{percent of the}} total current {{supplied}} is <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses as they do no real work for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer’s load source that causes the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacity.|$|E

25|$|The {{season is}} usually a few races shorter {{than that of the}} Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, and the prize money is {{significantly}} lower. However, over the last several years, a number of Cup Series drivers have run both the Xfinity and Cup Series events each weekend, using the Xfinity race as a warm-up to the Cup event at the same facility. Furthermore, several drivers not only participated in both Cup and Busch/Nationwide events in the same weekend but also began to compete in both series on a full-time basis. Kevin Harvick was the first Cup series driver to compete full-time in the Busch Series and win a title, <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> so twice; in 2001, he did this for Richard Childress Racing but only did so out of necessity as Dale Earnhardt's death forced him into the Cup series ahead of RCR's intended schedule for him. His win in 2006, where he raced three separate cars for RCR and his own race team, was the first of five consecutive titles in NBS/NNS that were won by Cup series regulars.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1791 the other monarchies of Europe watched with alarm the {{developments}} in France, and considered {{whether they should}} intervene, either in support of Louis XVI or {{to take advantage of}} the chaos in France. The key figure, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, brother to the French Queen Marie Antoinette, had initially looked on the Revolution calmly. He became more and more disturbed as the Revolution became more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war. On 27 August 1791, Leopold and King Frederick William II of Prussia, in consultation with emigrant French nobles, issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, which declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe in the well-being of Louis and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a way of taking action that would enable him to avoid <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> anything about France, at least for the moment, Paris saw the Declaration as a serious threat, and the revolutionary leaders denounced it.|$|E
500|$|Bill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht: Nighy {{was cast}} {{to give a}} {{sympathetic}} quality, so Olbricht {{would not be the}} [...] "fall guy".

The actor described his portrayal, [...] "One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform. It's so associated with evil that it took me several days to get used to being in costume." ...|$|E

500|$|Borah {{generally}} {{approved of}} many of Wilson's proposals, but found reasons to vote against them. [...] He voted against the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, after gaining a concession that no banker would initially be appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. Borah believed monopolies, public and private, should be broken up, and believed the new Federal Trade Commission would prove a means for trusts to control their regulators; he voted against the bill and stated he would not support confirmation of the first commissioners. The Clayton Antitrust Act, Borah opined, was merely {{a means by which}} Congress could appear to be dealing with the trusts without <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Wiseau {{mentioned}} {{plans for}} a Broadway adaptation of the film, {{in which he would}} appear only on opening night: [...] "It will be similar to {{what you see in the}} movie, except it will be musical. As well as, you will see… like, for example, Johnny, we could have maybe 10 Johnnys at the same time singing, or playing football. So, the decision have to be made at the time when we <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> choreography, ‘cause I’ll be doing choreography, as well I’ll be in it only one time, that’s it, as Johnny." [...] He mentioned the plans again during a 2016 interview describing his idea for it to be a [...] "musical slash comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Darabont {{described}} {{the process of}} developing the series and setting it up at a network as [...] "four years of frustration". He first initiated a deal with NBC to own copyrights to The Walking Dead, but was later declined. [...] "They were very excited about the idea of doing a zombie show until I handed them a zombie script where zombies were <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> zombie shit," [...] he stated. Darabont credited Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. [...] "Gale was tremendously instrumental in jump-starting it at a point where it felt like it was languishing, [...] "he asserted. [...] "I'd gotten turned down enough times, which is no reflection on the material, but no matter what you're trying to sell in Hollywood, you're Willy Loman and it's Death of a Salesman. You're out there trying to sell shit that nobody wants. Even if it's good shit." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "Release" [...] was {{developed}} by John Shiban and David Amann; the teleplay was written by Amann. Kim Manners helmed the directing of the episode. [...] "Release" [...] was originally going to be written by Shiban alone, but he later turned the script over to Amann because he was needed elsewhere at the time. Shiban had been desiring {{to write a story}} like [...] "Release" [...] for a while. The character of Hayes was crafted as an ambitious character, inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle: he was written to be either a [...] "brilliant guy who's solving crimes with his amazing intuition", comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or [...] "a guy who's <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> those crimes and playing a game", like Professor Moriarty. Shiban and Amman came up with a story wherein Scully encounters a [...] "genius" [...] from her classes at the FBI Academy at Quantico. Later on, they extrapolated on the story, allowing the [...] "genius" [...] crime solver to help John Doggett {{find out what happened to}} his son, Luke Doggett.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} issued {{in a clear}} jewel box with a die-cut {{cardboard}} O-card. It included sixteen pages, which fold {{out to be a}} poster, which displays the cover art. Both the disc and the disc tray feature — as described by Chris Morris — an [...] "image reflective of the mania displayed by the group's fans, and exemplary of American frequently deployed shock tactics: a kid carving the band's name into his arms with a scalpel." [...] Mike Bone from American Recordings said that [...] "we captured this not only by photography, but with video — him <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> it." [...] The front cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter, an American artist who would later paint the covers for the other Slayer releases Undisputed Attitude and Live Intrusion. The album sleeve features for the second time the backronym Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot. This phrase was first used on the vinyl edition of the album Show No Mercy where it was carved into the runout groove of the record.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith, who {{collaborated with}} Burton on Dark Shadows and , {{to write and}} produce a sequel to Beetlejuice. Grahame-Smith signed on with the {{intention}} of doing [...] "a story that is worthy of us <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat." [...] He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We talked {{for a couple of hours}} and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [...] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen." [...] The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; [...] "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice , time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story." ...|$|E

500|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "Sentimentality, in which crude emotion replaces dispassionate analysis, affects {{all aspects of}} public life, such as the debates over education, prison places and overseas aid. As Dalrymple points out, no country has ever escaped poverty via international aid—but never mind, since what matters is not <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> anything about state education or crime or Africa, but being seen to be caring about the 'vulnerable'". [...] The book was listed as a non-fiction choice by Steven Poole in The Guardian, who wrote, [...] "Dalrymple alternates vague ranting with surgical demolition (he is excellent on the fatuity of 'family impact statements' in court), and exhibits impressive thrift, in these uncertain times, with his research, getting tens of pages out of a single visit to WHSmith and the purchase of two newspapers. Perhaps the most suggestive sentence is tucked away in an endnote about tattoos: 'I wish I had the space to elaborate on the dermatological semiotics of violence in England'. If only someone had awarded him that space". The book was also {{the subject of a}} spoof review by John Crace in The Guardian, which satirised the book and its author.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Variously {{throughout}} the war, serious shortage of able-bodied men ("manpower") {{occurred in the}} country, and women were required to take {{on many of the}} traditional male roles, particularly in the area of arms manufacture; though this was only significant in the later years of the war, since unemployed men were often prioritised by employers. Women both found work in the munitions factories (as [...] "munitionettes") despite initial trade union opposition, which directly helped the war effort, but also in the Civil Service, where they took men's jobs, releasing them for the front. The number of women employed by the service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to over 102,000 by 1921. The overall increase in female employment is estimated at , from 5.9 to , and female trade union membership increased from 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918—an increase of 160 percent. Beckett suggests that most of these were working class women going into work at a younger age than they would otherwise have done, or married women returning to work. This taken together with the fact that only 23 percent of women in the munitions industry were <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> men's jobs, would limit substantially the overall impact of the war on the long-term prospects of the working woman.|$|E
