40|$|Authorship is {{a central}} element of {{scientific}} research carrying a variety of rewards and responsibilities, and while various guidelines exist, actual <b>author</b> <b>contributions</b> are often ambiguous. Inconsistent or limited contributions threaten to devalue authorship as intellectual currency and diminish authors' responsibility for published content. Researchers have assessed <b>author</b> <b>contributions</b> in the medical literature and other research fields, but similar data for the field of ecological research are lacking. Authorship practices in ecological research are broadly representative {{of a variety of}} fields due to the cross-disciplinary nature of collaborations in ecological studies. To better understand <b>author</b> <b>contributions</b> to current research, we distributed a survey regarding co-author contributions to a random selection of 996 lead authors of manuscripts published in ecological journals in 2010. We obtained useable responses from 45 % of surveyed authors. Reported lead <b>author</b> <b>contributions</b> in ecological research studies consistently included conception of the project idea, data collection, analysis, and writing. Middle and last <b>author</b> <b>contributions</b> instead showed a high level of individual variability. Lead authorship in ecology is well defined while secondary authorship is more ambiguous. Nearly half (48 %) of all studies included in our survey had some level of non-compliance with Ecological Society of America (ESA) authorship guidelines and the majority of studies (78 %) contained at least one co-author that did not meet International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) requirements. Incidence of non-compliance varied with lead author occupation and author position. The probability of a study including an author that was non-compliant with ESA guidelines was lowest for professor-led studies and highest for graduate student and post doctoral researcher-led studies. Among studies with > two co-authors, all lead authors met ESA guidelines and only 2 % failed to meet ICMJE requirements. Middle (24 % ESA, 63 % ICMJE) and last (37 % ESA, 60 % ICMJE) authors had higher rates of non-compliance. The probability of a study containing a co-author that did not meet ESA or ICMJE requirements increased significantly with the number of co-authors per study although even studies with only two co-authors had a high probability of non-compliance of approximately 60 % (ICMJE) and 15 to 40 % (ESA). Given the variable and often limited contributions of authors in our survey and past studies of other research disciplines, institutions, journals, and scientific societies need to implement new approaches to instill meaning in authorship status. A byline approach may not alter <b>author</b> <b>contributions</b> but would better define individual contributions and reduce existing ambiguity regarding the meaning of authorship in modern ecological research...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} measuring user contributions to versioned, collaborative bodies of information, such as wikis. Measuring the <b>contributions</b> of individual <b>authors</b> {{can be used to}} divide revenue, to recognize merit, to award status promotions, and to choose the order of authors when citing the content. In the context of the Wikipedia, previous works on <b>author</b> <b>contribution</b> estimation have focused on two criteria: the total text created, and the total number of edits performed. We show that neither of these criteria work well: both techniques are vulnerable to manipulation, and the totaltext criterion fails to reward people who polish or re-arrange the content. We consider and compare various alternative criteria that take into account the quality of a contribution, in addition to the quantity, and we analyze how the criteria differ in the way they rank authors according to their contributions. As an outcome of this study, we propose to adopt total edit longevity as a measure of <b>author</b> <b>contribution.</b> Edit longevity is resistant to simple attacks, since edits are counted towards an <b>author’s</b> <b>contribution</b> only if other <b>authors</b> accept the <b>contribution.</b> Edit longevity equally rewards people who create content, and people who rearrange or polish the content. Finally, edit longevity distinguishes the people who contribute little (who have contribution close to zero) from spammers or vandals, whose contribution quickly grows negative...|$|R
