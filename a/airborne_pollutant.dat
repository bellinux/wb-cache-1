2500|$|Heslop-Harrison (Harrison and Garrett 1926; Harrison 1928) {{suggested}} that the increase of melanic moths in industrialised regions was due to [...] "mutation pressure", not to selection by predators which he regarded as negligible.

Similar experiments by Hughes McKenney (1932) and Thomasen and Lemche (1933) failed to replicate these results. However, the statistician and geneticist Ronald Fisher showed that Heslop-Harrison's controls were inadequate. This hypothesis, however, appeared to be falsified by breeding experiments.

50|$|Exposure is {{commonly}} {{understood to be}} the concentration of the <b>airborne</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{in the air at}} the mouth and nose boundary.

The fraction of this ambient concentration that is inhaled by a person depends mainly on their location (indoor or outdoor), distance to pollution sources and their minute ventilation. Traditionally exposure is estimated based on outdoor concentrations at the residential address. Trips to other locations and physical activity level are mostly neglected although some recent studies have attempted to use portable and wearable sensors.|$|E

40|$|Summary]: It was {{established}} that improvement in air quality in livestock buildings could produce significant benefits for animals, {{workers and the}} environment. In order to achieve a sustained reduction in the concentration of <b>airborne</b> <b>pollutants</b> in livestock building; the different management, environmental and housing factors, which could influence the concentrations within and emissions of <b>airborne</b> <b>pollutants</b> from livestock buildings had to be statistically evaluated. Thus a broad study of air quality in piggery buildings was designed (1) to determine the key piggery design and management factors that affect the internal concentrations and emissions of <b>airborne</b> <b>pollutants</b> and then to (2) model and therefore able to predict the concentrations and emission rates of the main pollutants.

40|$|Between 1997 and 1999 a {{comprehensive}} survey of <b>airborne</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations within, and emissions from, 160 Australian piggery buildings was undertaken. The primary {{aim of the}} study was to model the concentrations and emissions of different airborne pollutants and thus identify potential reduction techniques. The main factors identified as significantly influencing <b>airborne</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations were building type, pen hygiene, pig flow management, seasons, building volume, ventilation airflow rate, air temperature, relative humidity, and farm size (as expressed by number of sows on site). These effects were included in comprehensive statistical models to explain the variation in measured concentrations and emission rates. The models developed were validated and fine-tuned using the ‘‘leave-one-out’’ cross-validation technique. This article details the validation technique used that was aimed to maximise the value of available experimental data and further improves the practicality of the models developed. The main result {{of the study was}} the development of an improved model. The study results, and the resulting prediction models, should help improve air quality in piggery buildings by providing decision makers with an awareness of the environmental conditions inside and outside of piggery buildings. In turn, that should lead to improvements in the health and welfare of pigs and piggery staff and the sustainability of the piggery operations...|$|E

40|$|The {{negative}} effects of high concentration of airborne pollutants on animal health, welfare and productivity are well documented. Reducing the concentration of airborne pollutants in livestock buildings is therefore an important task and could also help to reduce the {{occupational health and safety}} risk associated with farm work. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of spraying a mixture of oil and water directly on the floors of livestock building or applying oil treatment to different bedding materials on the concentration of airborne pollutants inside three different livestock facilities. In addition, a number of other <b>airborne</b> <b>pollutant</b> reduction methods were trialled in a horse facility. Air quality parameters were recorded in: (1) a number of partially slatted, mechanically or naturally ventilated pig facilities; (2) a horse stable; and (3) two poultry buildings. <b>Airborne</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations were measured and compared between the treatment and control facilities. The concentrations of both inhalable and respirable airborne particles were significantly reduced in the experimental pig facilities. The results also demonstrated a significant reduction (P< 0. 001) in the concentrations of inhalable and respirable airborne particles in the horse boxes treated with oil-impregnated bedding material as well in the oil treated poultry building. This technique would enable livestock producers to improve the environmental quality in livestock buildings at a relatively low cost. ...|$|E
