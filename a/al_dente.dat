50|$|Unlike many Western {{noodles and}} pastas, Chinese noodles made from wheat flour are usually made from salted dough and {{therefore}} {{do not require}} the addition of salt to the liquid {{in which they are}} boiled. Chinese noodles also cook very quickly, generally requiring less than 5 minutes to become <b>al</b> <b>dente</b> and some taking less than a minute to finish cooking, with thinner noodles requiring less time to cook. Chinese noodles made from rice or mung bean starch do not generally contain salt.|$|E
5000|$|Monkland Avenue {{has been}} a {{commercial}} street since the 1930s and has gone through various highs and lows. Today the strip is transforming into a more upper-scale commercial street and is generally doing very well. It is home to many small businesses including restaurants (Monkland Tavern, Lucille's, <b>Al</b> <b>Dente),</b> cafés (St-Viateur Bagel, Second Cup, Marconi's), bars (Typhoon's, Ye Olde Orchard), food stores (Le Maître Boucher, Première Moisson), unique boutiques (Ciel Bleu, Kidlink, Enfantino, 101 artisans, Espace Tricot… [...] ) and a dance school (Les Ateliers Turcotte).|$|E
50|$|Properly cooked risotto is {{rich and}} creamy {{even if no}} cream is added, due to the starch in the grains, if {{properly}} prepared. It has some resistance or bite (<b>al</b> <b>dente)</b> and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda ("wavy, or flowing in waves"). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once, as it continues to cook in its own heat, making the grains absorb all the liquid and become soft and dry.|$|E
50|$|Pastelarias and Asian {{restaurants}} {{serve it}} in the entire country. They generally are presented in chicken (the most common), beef, shrimp and pork versions, with vegetarian and egg versions being much rarer. Brazilian yakisoba is typically served much more <b>al</b> <b>dente</b> than the Japanese, being also heavy in soy sauce, sesame oil, and vegetables, almost always including at least carrot, cabbage, onion {{and at least one}} dark green species (usually other than kale, collard, spinach, chicory or mustard) such as Chinese cabbage, and less often either bean sprouts, broccoli/broccolini, zucchini, shiitake, bell pepper and/or cucumber.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} features: First, the wontons are predominantly prawn, with {{small amounts of}} minced pork, or no pork at all. Second, aficionados will insist on fresh, smooth thin noodles which are <b>al</b> <b>dente,</b> free from the taste and odor which is characteristic in many egg noodles when cooked. Third, the bouillon is light brown (prepared from dried flounder) and is usually steaming hot. Lastly, garlic chives are used as a garnish. The first two give the dish a wet but crunchy or crispy mouthfeel. The last two give the dish a unique bouquet.|$|E
