40|$|Abstract: In {{a context}} of network covert channels, unused header fields in {{communication}} protocols are vulnerable to embed secret data. An IP Option field in the IP header is considered as one of useful spaces for constructing the Internet-wide network covert channels. On the other hand, IP packets with IP Option have been said non-transparent on the global Internet. This paper investigates how an IP packet with IP option can be going through over the Internet by active and passive monitoring methods. At first, we investigated AS border traffic in an academic AS and a commercial IX. The result was that only four types of IP Options, Route Record (RR), Time Stamp (TS), No Operation (NOP) and End of Option List (EOOL), were observed. Then, we preliminary evaluated transparency of these four types IP Options over the global Internet by probing from ten Planetlab nodes on six countries against 5, 000 randomly chosen destination IP addresses and 11, 251 intermediate routers. Both destination addresses and intermediate routers were included in 1, 132 intermediate ASes. As the active measurement result, 57 % routers replied to IP packets with the RR Option, that is, the RR Option was transparent in 914 intermediate <b>ASes</b> <b>on</b> this experiment. On the other hand, 41 % of intermediate routers replied probe packets with the TS option, that is, the TS Option was transparent in 811 intermediate <b>ASes</b> <b>on</b> this experiment...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of whether a score for a specific antiretroviral (e. g. lopinavir/r in this analysis) that improves prediction of viral load response given by existing expert-based interpretation systems (IS) could be derived from analyzing the correlation between genotypic data and virological response using statistical methods remains largely unanswered. We used the data of the patients from the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) Study for whom genotypic data were stored in the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database (UK HDRD) to construct a training/validation dataset of treatment change episodes (TCE). We used the average square error (<b>ASE)</b> <b>on</b> a 10 -fold cross-validation and on a test dataset (the EuroSIDA TCE database) to compare the performance of a newly derived lopinavir/r score with that of the 3 most widely used expert-based interpretation rules (ANRS, HIVDB and Rega). Our analysis identified mutations V 82 A, I 54 V, K 20 I and I 62 V, which were associated with reduced viral response and mutations I 15 V and V 91 S which determined lopinavir/r hypersensitivity. All models performed equally well (<b>ASE</b> <b>on</b> test ranging between 1. 1 and 1. 3, p =  0. 34). We fully explored the potential of linear regression to construct a simple predictive model for lopinavir/r-based TCE. Although, the performance of our proposed score was similar to that of already existing IS, previously unrecognized lopinavir/r-associated mutations were identified. The analysis illustrates an approach of validation of expert-based IS {{that could be used in}} the future for other antiretrovirals and in other settings outside HIV research...|$|R

In this context, suitable waveguide optimization enabling the reduction of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold values appears as important as synthetic chemistry protocols to promote polymer robustness against photo-oxidation. In this work, we develop rib waveguides with different geometries based on four different fluorene-based compounds and assess the influence of rib confinement <b>on</b> <b>ASE</b> properties. We observe ASE threshold values as low as 8. 9 × 10 - 4 mJ cm- 2, being among the lowest threshold values reported so far on blue emitting polymer/oligomer waveguides.
