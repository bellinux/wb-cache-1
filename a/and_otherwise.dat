5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{pioneering}} efforts by Olav Selvaag and others, archaic <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> unnecessary restrictions were relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences. Norwegians often undertake home improvement projects on their own, and many have built most of their own homes.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In April 1863, food {{shortages}} led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. Perhaps even more seriously, he clashed with powerful state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> blocked mobilization plans.|$|E

5|$|Knowledge of Roman history stands {{apart from}} other civilizations in the ancient world. Its chronicles, {{military}} <b>and</b> <b>otherwise,</b> document the city's very foundation to its eventual demise. Although some histories have been lost, such as Trajan's account of the Dacian Wars, and others, such as Rome's earliest histories, are at least semi-apocryphal, the extant histories of Rome's military history are extensive.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated. If for some i all maps are null homotopic, then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.|$|E

Trevor Pinnock won a Gramophone Award for his recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos with the European Brandenburg Ensemble, an occasional orchestra formed to mark his 60th birthday.|$|E

5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} artists, musical <b>and</b> <b>otherwise,</b> have collaborated with Stereolab.

They have released tracks by and toured with post-rock band Tortoise, while John McEntire of Tortoise has in turn worked on several Stereolab albums. In the 1990s Stereolab and veteran industrial band Nurse With Wound released two limited-edition records together; both contained Nurse With Wound remixes of original tracks provided by Stereolab.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} single-player story, Undead Nightmare adds two {{multiplayer}} modes: Undead Overrun and Land Grab. The former is a horde mode in which {{up to four}} players cooperatively fight off waves of zombies. Players must open coffins between waves to replenish a countdown timer, which discourages players from camping in the same location. It is also designed so as to encourage cooperation such that players can revive each other if nearby. The other mode, Land Grab, is an additional game mode within the main game's multiplayer free roam <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> unconnected to the undead theme. In Land Grab, players attempt to secure seven areas across the game's environment. While players with the base game can join in Land Grab games, only Undead Nightmare owners can initiate them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Sports Illustrated {{magazine}} estimated Vick's {{annual income}} between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes. Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound Ness became {{widely known}} {{due to his}} later {{appearance}} in the Super Smash Bros. series. He appeared in the original Super Smash Bros. and its sequels: Melee, Brawl, and 3DS/Wii U. In Europe, which did not see an original EarthBound release, Ness is better known {{for his role in}} the fighting game than for his original role in the role-playing game. He returned in the 2001 Melee with EarthBound Mr. Saturn, which could be thrown at enemies <b>and</b> <b>otherwise</b> pushes items off the battlefield. Melee also had an unlockable Fourside level based on the EarthBound location. Ness was joined by Mother 3 Lucas in Brawl, and both characters returned in 3DS/Wii U, its sequel. Players can fight in the 3DS Magicant stage, which features clips from the Mother series in its background.|$|E
