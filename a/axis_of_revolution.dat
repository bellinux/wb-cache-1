40|$|AbstractThe study {{deals with}} a {{proposal}} and experimental study on the tilted planetary motion drilling for CFRP. The authors have modified cutting mechanism principle of the orbital drilling, which named as the tilted planetary motion drilling. Its <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> tool rotation spindle is not parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> planetary <b>revolution.</b> The tilted angle is adjustable from 0 to 2 degrees. Because <b>of</b> tool rotation <b>axis</b> is tilted, penetration is not caused by outermost cutting edges but inner cutting edges. If penetration could be occurred, the inner cutting edges penetrate firstly, then the outermost edges enlarge drilled hole and these sequence can avoid generation of delaminations and burrs. The tilted planetary motion drilling has been demonstrated by the practical fundamental drilling experiment by use of a high-speed spindle unit and a lathe as imitating tilted planetary motion. From the experimental result, capability of tilted planetary motion drilling has been realized and no burrs and delaminations are observed on the workpiece...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the space {{intersecting}} curve between two surfaces <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> with parallel axes of surfaces have been determined. Two mathematical models for determination of intersecting curve between two surfaces <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> have been formed: auxiliary planes {{have been used}} in the first mathematical model and auxiliary spheres {{have been used in}} the second model (Obradović 2000). In the first case each auxiliary plane intersected with each surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> on circle and two points of intersecting curve are obtained as intersecting points between these two circles. In the second case centres of two locks of auxiliary spheres are put on axes <b>of</b> surfaces <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> (centre <b>of</b> first lock is on <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the first surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> and centre <b>of</b> second lock is on <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the second surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution)</b> on same z coordinate (when axes <b>of</b> surfaces <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> are parallel with z <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> coordinate system). First lock sphere intersects the first surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> on w 1 parallels and second lock corresponding sphere intersects the second surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> on w 2 circles. It is possible to find a relationship that for selected radius of the first lock sphere can determine the radius of second lock sphere and real points of intersecting curve have been determined by use of these two spheres.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{ray tracing}} surfaces <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> is presented. The {{objective is to}} improve the computation cost and data structure during the intersection determination between a ray and a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> As a preprocessing step, a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> is subdivided into a series of simple primitives. We experimented our method with two subdivision schemes. In the first subdivision scheme, a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> is approximated by bounded cones. The offset curve of a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> is subdivided into linear segments. A series of bounded cones is produced by revolving these linear segments around the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation. The second subdivision scheme uses revolute quadric surfaces to reconstruct a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> The offset curve is approximated by connected conic sections. These conic sections are converted to a series of coaxial revolute quadric surfaces by revolving the conic sections around the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation. After a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> is subdivided into bounded cones or revolute quadric surfaces, a binary bounding volume tree structure is built and used for finding the intersection between a ray and the surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> Calculating the intersection of a ray and a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> is then reduced to a simple tree searching routine with the data structure. Further reduction of the processing time can be achieved by using range searching and adaptive bounding volumes for the surfaces...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} recovering the 3 D shape of a surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> from multiple uncalibrated perspective views.

However, there exists one degree of freedom in the reconstruction which corresponds to the unknown orientation <b>of</b> the <b>revolution</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> In this paper, such an ambiguity is removed by estimating the horizon, again, using the image invariants associated with the surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> A bundle-adjustment approach is then proposed to provide an optimal estimate of the meridian when multiple uncalibrated views of the same surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> are available.
