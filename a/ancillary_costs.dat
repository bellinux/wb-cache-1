5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other <b>ancillary</b> <b>costs,</b> such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E

3000|$|The last {{column of}} Table  3 reports the cost {{difference}} between the forecast and perfect-foresight cases divided by total wind generation {{over the course of}} the year. The values in this column represent the cost of wind uncertainty and variability (which we term ‘wind-integration cost’ in the table) on a per-MWh basis.

30|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that without the}} PEVs, wind uncertainty and variability impose an <b>ancillary</b> <b>cost</b> of about 0.23 /MWh of wind. This cost increases to 0.46 /MWh of wind if PEV charging is not controlled (i.e., PEVs charge immediately upon arrival at a charging station). However, if PEV charging can be fully controlled, the <b>ancillary</b> <b>cost</b> of wind uncertainty and variability is reduced to 0.09 /MWh. We also examine {{a case in which}} there is a limited two-hour window of flexibility within which PEV charging can be controlled. We show that such a two-hour window of flexibility provides much of the benefits of complete PEV-charging control. This is because the benefit of controlled PEV charging is in allowing the system to more easily accommodate errors in estimating wind availability. Although wind forecasts can be wrong in a particular hour, these errors tend to smooth out over the course of several hours. Thus, some limited flexibility in shifting PEV-charging loads around within two hours provides almost as much benefit as complete control of PEV charging in reducing wind-integration costs. The choice of studying a two-hour window of flexibility is meant to represent an intermediate case of charging control, between the extremes of uncontrolled and fully controlled PEV charging. One could study other intermediate cases, which is an area of further study.|$|R

50|$|These are the {{secondary}} or {{side effects of}} mitigation policies, and including them in studies can result in higher or lower mitigation cost estimates (Markandya et al.., 2001:455). Reduced mortality and morbidity costs are potentially a major ancillary benefit of mitigation. This benefit is associated with reduced use of fossil fuels, thereby resulting in less air pollution (Barker et al.., 2001:564). There may also be <b>ancillary</b> <b>costs.</b> In developing countries, for example, if policy changes resulted in a relative increase in electricity prices, this could result in more pollution (Markandya et al.., 2001:462).|$|E
50|$|An energy slave is used {{to compare}} the {{productivity}} of a person and the energy that would be required to produce that work in the modern, oil fuelled industrial economy, although it could be applied anywhere that labor is produced with non-human sourced energy. It does not include the <b>ancillary</b> <b>costs</b> of damage to the environment or social structures. Formally, one energy slave produces one unit of human labor through the non-human tools and energy supplied by the industrial economy, and therefore 1 ES times a constant that converts to work accomplished = 1 human labor unit.|$|E
30|$|Concerns {{surrounding}} growing energy demand, climate change, and finite fossil-fuel supplies {{have increased}} interest {{in the use of}} renewable energy resources. Renewables, such as wind, can significantly reduce electricity-related emissions and costs by displacing conventional fossil-fueled resources. They can, however, have <b>ancillary</b> <b>cost</b> impacts on other generators. This is because their real-time output is uncertain and variable when making operational decisions day- or even hour-ahead. More specifically, to accommodate this variability, conventional generators may have to frequently adjust their output levels or be cycled on and off. A power system may also need more reserves from conventional generators to balance wind uncertainty, forcing generators to operate inefficiently in a partially loaded fashion [1, 2]. Empirical numerical studies of the Belgian [3], Irish [4], Texas [5], and U.K. [6] power systems further demonstrate these effects of wind.|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} ship chartering, demurrage is an <b>ancillary</b> <b>cost</b> {{that represents}} liquidated damages for delays.

Laytime is the term used to quantify the time allowed within which an operation is allowed to be made. Demurrage is laytime consumed less laytime allocated (if any). The master of the ship must give a Notice of Readiness (NOR) to the charterer when the ship has arrived at the port of loading or discharge. The NOR informs the charterer that the ship is ready to load or discharge. The date and time of the NOR determines when laytime is to commence.|$|R

5000|$|St. Raphael's {{is a high}} Gothic Revival structure, {{built of}} {{sandstone}} from Berea. [...] Since construction in the 1890s, it {{has been one of}} Springfield's most distinctive buildings, {{due in large part to}} its two front towers — the bell tower is 135 ft high, and the principal tower 184 ft. By climbing 156 steps to the summit of the principal tower, one gains a panoramic view of the city and surrounding countryside. The building's general plan is that of a streamlined Latin cross, with slight gabled projections near the rear forming the crosspieces. [...] Three entrances pierce the facade, while lancet windows of similar height are placed at varying locations in the towers, and two-story windows fill the side bays. Widest and tallest are the windows placed in the rear-side projections and above the entrances on the facade. Both towers are topped with pointed roofs, surrounded by ornamental pointed roofs of far smaller sizes, while the roof of the main part of the church is a steep gable. [...] Despite extensive Gothic Revival detailing, such as the pointed-arch windows and doorways, the building also retains some elements of the Romanesque Revival style, including the false buttresses and columns around the main entrance, as well as the sheer massing of both towers. [...] By the time that the building was complete, parishioners had spent $75,000 on construction and <b>ancillary</b> <b>costs.</b> The architect for St. Raphael's was Charles A.

50|$|The flyaway cost can be meaningfully {{compared}} to another cost metric, the weapons system cost. The weapons system cost (often {{referred to as}} the procurement cost) is the total price of the aircraft. A good {{way of looking at the}} difference is the flyaway cost is the cost of making the aircraft, but the weapons system cost is the cost of buying the aircraft. Weapons systems <b>costs</b> may include <b>ancillary</b> equipment <b>costs,</b> one time non-recurring contract costs, and airframe, engine and avionics support costs. For example, the flyaway cost for the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet up to 2009 (for the 449 units built) was US$ 57.5 million per unit, but the weapons system cost was 39.8% higher, at US$ 80.4 million per unit. The production cost of technologically complicated aircraft will always be higher during the low rate initial production period, and costs per units invariably drop as an aircraft is put into full production. The Government Accountability Office has found that the United States Department of Defense rarely achieves these cost savings because few programs move from LRIP to full-scale production.|$|R
