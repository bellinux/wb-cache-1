Drawing on ethnographic data collected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> economics <b>news</b> <b>desk</b> {{of a major}} quality newspaper in Belgium, we examine the link between linguistic performance and journalistic competence.

40|$|As ethnographic {{studies of}} the visual {{gatekeeping}} process at news rooms are scarce and <b>the</b> increasingly digitised <b>news</b> era demands for reconsideration, {{this article focuses on}} the results of a qualitative study <b>at</b> <b>the</b> photo <b>news</b> <b>desk</b> of a Flemish newspaper in Belgium. Our aim has been to provide an update and a broadening of previous studies on visual gatekeeping processes, and the findings are based on observations, in-depth interviews and reconstructions of the visual selection process. Our results show that routine and organisational influences as the ‘newsroom culture’ and the ‘rhythm’ of the newspaper outweigh individual preferences of photo editors. In-house photographers are systematically preferred to wire photographs. The information value of photos prevails, but aesthetics and good taste add another layer of deliberation. In addition, layout policies explicitly steer photo editors in their decision-making process. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Concurrently, first {{reports of}} a suicide attack in Jerusalem were {{beginning}} to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> channel's <b>news</b> <b>desk.</b> Executives <b>at</b> Telad were faced with a dilemma about which of these events should be broadcast. Given the propensity of suicide attacks during this period (following the Second Intifada), the situation was fairly common, and normally handled by [...] "handing off" [...] broadcast to the Channel 2 News company. However, on this occasion Telad ultimately decided to split the screen - broadcasting the game on the rightmost third of the screen, while airing <b>the</b> breaking <b>news</b> and footage from the scene on the remaining space. <b>The</b> <b>news</b> break featured pictures of the devastated scene of the attack.

50|$|Jensen {{was known}} in New York for his booming, gravelly voice and {{deliberate}} demeanor, and was often {{thought of as a}} local version of Walter Cronkite. WCBS had gone back and forth with WNBC-TV for first place, but under Jensen became the dominant station in New York, a lead it kept for most of the time until the mid-1980s. He was also known for asking perceptive questions, even of his colleagues <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>desk.</b> WCBS' reporters had to know their stories very well if their stories aired when Jensen was behind the anchor desk. They risked embarrassing themselves on-air if Jensen asked them a question that they could not answer. Over the years, his partners at the anchor desk - some of them New York broadcast legends in their own right - included Ralph Penza, Rolland Smith, Carol Martin, Michele Marsh and finally Dana Tyler. He was reportedly the model for Jim Dial, Murphy Brown's co-anchor.|$|E
40|$|Within {{the field}} of media {{discourse}} {{it has been shown}} that press releases constitute an important and interesting genre. In particular, previous discourse-analytic work (Jacobs 1999) has demonstrated that they are heavily preformulated, i. e. through a number of metapragmatic features like self-quotation and third-person self-reference they can easily be copied by journalists in their own news reporting. The present article sets out to further explore this notion of preformulation by presenting an innovative mix of linguistic ethnography (Rampton 2007) and computer-assisted writing process analysis (Perrin 2006) on how press releases are being written at the PR department and rewritten <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>desk.</b> Drawing on preliminary fieldwork data collected in various institutional settings (including Kim Sleurs’s work at a major Belgian financial institution as well as Tom Van Hout’s work at a Belgian Dutch-language quality newspaper), we will point to the wide range of practical as well as political concerns that have been glossed over in previous work on the topic. We will also discuss the practical implications of these findings both for PR and media professionals...|$|E
