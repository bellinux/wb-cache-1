5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> were {{rated on a}} scale of 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. Most of this part of the creek <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> were rated 166 or higher, which was considered optimal. The waters near the mouths of West Branch and East Branch Fishing Creeks, and Fishing Creek near Benton, were rated 113 to 160, considered suboptimal. A portion of West Creek was rated 60–112, considered marginal.|$|E
5|$|Mud Creek {{is named}} for its muddiness. An area near it was settled as early as 1772 and several bridges were built across it <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> in the 20th century. The creek is {{designated}} as a warm-water fishery.|$|E

5|$|The Merced River <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> are {{a popular}} {{recreational}} area {{in part because}} of Yosemite National Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E

The house mouse (Mus musculus) is now the most common mammal of the Torrens environ.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, the John Day basin was frequented by Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and {{gathered}} roots and berries in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, and a few small towns along the river <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>tributaries.</b> Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally. Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E
