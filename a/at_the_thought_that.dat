5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides {{to go to the}} landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
25|$|With this {{commission}} Manon, the third trophy, {{slipped out of}} the room, as untouched as she had come; her errand didn't seem to trouble her.

25|$|At Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Edna {{could leave}} the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports car so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the {{fireworks}} display. They are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money {{to be able to}} retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to blackmail after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, each finalist must ask their nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner tells the truth. Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, but looks forward to marrying Skinner.|$|E
500|$|Visitors to Seeon {{included}} Prince Felix Yusupov, {{husband of}} Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who wrote, [...] "I claim categorically {{that she is}} not Anastasia Nicolaievna, but just an adventuress, a sick hysteric and a frightful playactress. I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, I am convinced that you would recoil in horror <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." [...] Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.|$|E
500|$|The All Blacks' last {{match in}} the British Isles was against Swansea at Saint Helen's Ground on 30 December. Swansea had only lost once in over two seasons (to Cardiff) {{and were the}} {{champion}} club team of Great Britain. Wallace said of the match [...] "This was the thirty-second match of the tour and our hearts rejoiced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{this was to be}} the last." [...] The first half was mainly spent in All Blacks territory as they struggled to gain ground kicking into a strong wind and, after 25 minutes, Swansea scored a try through Fred Scrine that was unconverted. The half finished 3–0 to Swansea. The All Blacks playing with the wind to their backs nearly scored a try to McGregor but he was ruled to have stepped out. However, soon after, Wallace gained possession and ran towards Swansea's 25-yard line before kicking a drop-goal in the strong wind to give the All Blacks a 4–3 lead. The All Blacks then kept forcing Swansea back with kick after kick for the next 15 minutes to win the match 4–3.|$|E

2500|$|Acceptance of the Absurd: a {{solution}} {{in which one}} accepts the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, believing that by accepting the Absurd, one can achieve the greatest extent of one's freedom, and that by recognizing no religious or other moral constraints and by revolting against the Absurd while simultaneously accepting it as unstoppable, one could possibly be content from the personal meaning constructed in the process. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as [...] "demoniac madness": [...] "He rages most of all <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{to those}} who refuse to be oedipalized {{in one form or}} another, at one end or the other in the treatment, the {{psychoanalyst}} is there to call the asylum or the police for help.

In 1945, he was hiding in monastic clothes at Bistrița Monastery, where he met the medical assistant and monk-in-training Valeriu Anania. In his memoirs, Anania describes Buzdugan as a mediocre poet, his Orthodox devotional pieces comparable to Lord's Army hymns, adding: [...] "He grew old with the impression of him being a great poet, and I became awfully sad <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> I might grow old with that same impression of myself." [...] According to Anania, Buzdugan also angered the starets with his urban demeanor, and left for Bucharest when [...] "times changed for the better".|$|E

2500|$|For his part, Thomas Jefferson {{is perhaps}} one of the Founding Fathers with the most outspoken of deist tendencies, though he is not known to have called himself a deist, {{generally}} referring to himself as a Unitarian. In particular, his treatment of the Biblical gospels, which he titled The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, but subsequently became more commonly known as the Jefferson Bible, exhibits a strong deist tendency of stripping away all supernatural and dogmatic references from the Christ story. However, Frazer, following the lead of Sydney Ahlstrom, characterizes Jefferson as not a Deist but a [...] "theistic rationalist", because Jefferson believed in God's continuing activity in human affairs. Frazer cites Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, where he wrote, [...] "I tremble" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> [...] "God is just," [...] and he warned of eventual [...] "supernatural influence" [...] to abolish the scourge of slavery.|$|E
2500|$|The Shah and {{his prime}} {{minister}} had an antagonistic relationship. Part {{of the problem}} stemmed {{from the fact that}} Mossadegh was connected by blood to the former royal Qajar dynasty, and saw the Pahlavi king as a usurper to the throne. But the real issue stemmed from the fact that Mossadegh represented a pro-democratic force that wanted to temper the Shah's rule in Iranian politics. He wanted the Shah to be a ceremonial monarch rather than a ruling monarch, thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah. While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly, Mossadegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote (the latter which the Shah supported as well) in order to block the Shah's ability to act. As a result, the oil nationalization issue became increasingly intertwined with the Mossadegh's pro-democracy movement. The dejected Shah was angered by Mossadegh's [...] "insolence" [...] (according to Abbas Milani, he angrily paced in the rooms of his palace <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he would be reduced to a figurehead). But Mossadegh and the oil nationalization's popularity prevented the Shah from acting against his prime minister (which was allowed under Iran's constitution, something that Mossadegh felt a king had no right to do). In 1952 the Shah dismissed Mossadegh, replacing him with Ahmad Qavam (a veteran prime minister). But widespread protests by Mossadegh supporters resulted in the Shah immediately reinstating him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God promised to {{maintain}} the covenant with Abraham and his offspring as an everlasting covenant throughout the ages, and assigned all the land of Canaan {{to him and his}} offspring as an everlasting holding. God further told Abraham that he and his offspring throughout the ages were to keep God's covenant and every male (including every slave) was to be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin at the age of eight days {{as a sign of the}} covenant with God. If any male failed to circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that person was to be cut off from his kin for having broken God's covenant. And God renamed Sarai as Sarah, and told Abraham that God would bless her and give Abraham a son by her so that she would give rise to nations and rulers. Abraham threw himself on his face and laughed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> a child could be born to a man of a hundred and a woman of ninety, and Abraham asked God to bless Ishmael. But God told him that Sarah would bear Abraham a son, and Abraham was to name him Isaac, and God would maintain the everlasting covenant with him and his offspring. In response to Abraham's prayer, God blessed Ishmael as well and promised to make him exceedingly numerous, the father of twelve chieftains and a great nation. But God would maintain the covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah would bear at the same season the next year. And when God finished speaking, God disappeared. That very day, Abraham circumcised himself, Ishmael, and every male in his household, as God had directed. The maftir (...) reading that concludes the parashah reports that when Abraham circumcised himself and his household, Abraham was 99 and Ishmael was 13. The seventh reading ( [...] , aliyah), the third open portion ( [...] , petuchah), chapter [...] and the parashah end here.|$|E

The time of mercy will be then past, for now is that acceptable time, behold now is the day of salvation; the gate of mercy will then be shut, and must not be opened again; for now is that gate open, now it is open for a door of hope (2 Cor 6:2; Matt 25:10; Luke 13:25).|$|R
