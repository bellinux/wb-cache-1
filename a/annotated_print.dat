40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we extend the Semantic Desktop {{with a novel}} input modality: {{handwriting}} on paper. This extension allows for <b>annotating</b> <b>printed</b> documents with handwritten notes, which are then recognized, interpreted and integrated into the per-sonal knowledge space. Thus it supports personal knowledge work on paper. In partic-ular, the user can mark any text segment and annotate it {{with his or her}} own comments. The semantic of these comments and marks are then interpreted and, finally, the result is included in the user’s Semantic Desktop. The methodology for finding the intended meaning of the annotation in context of the marked text is presented in this paper. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we have implemented a prototype for the NEPOMUK Semantic Desktop. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Lehigh Steel Collection (LSC) is an {{extremely}} large, heterogeneous set of documents dating from the 1960 's through the 1990 's. It was retrieved by Lehigh University after it acquired research facilities from Bethlehem Steel, a now-bankrupt company that was once the second-largest steel producer and the largest shipbuilder in the United States. The documents account for and describe research and development activities that were conducted on site, and consist of a very wide range of technical documentation, handwritten notes and memos, <b>annotated</b> <b>printed</b> documents, etc. This paper addresses only a sub-part of this collection: the approximately 4000 engineering drawings and blueprints that were retrieved. The challenge resides essentially {{in the fact that}} these documents come in different sizes and shapes, {{in a wide variety of}} conservation and degradation stages, and more importantly in bulk, and without ground-truth.

40|$|Knowledge workers use paper {{extensively}} for document reviewing and note-taking {{due to its}} versatility {{and simplicity}} of use. As users <b>annotate</b> <b>printed</b> documents and gather notes, they create a rich web of annotations and cross references. Unfortunately, as paper is a static media, this web often gets trapped in the physical world. While several digital solutions such as XLibris [15] and Digital Desk [18] have been proposed, they suffer from a small display size or onerous hardware requirements. To address these limitations, we propose PapierCraft, a gesture-based interface that allows users to manipulate digital documents directly using their printouts as proxies. Using a digital pen, users can annotate a printout or draw command gestures to indicate operations such as copying a document area, pasting an area previously copied, or creating a link. Upon pen synchronization, our infrastructure executes these commands and presents the result in a customized viewer. In this paper we describe the design {{and implementation of the}} PapierCraft command system, and report on early user feedback...|$|R

40|$|Geographic {{information}} systems {{are designed to}} deal with data arrayed in space, {{and over the years}} they have gained a reputation for taking an essentially static view of the world. There are good reasons for this, of course, and they stem from the early connection between GIS and maps, and the notion that GIS is best understood as a collection of maps stored in a computer. Maps are expensive to produce, since humans must be involved in the elaborate process of acquiring and compiling data, editing, <b>annotating,</b> and <b>printing,</b> and today the U. S. Geological Survey estimates that a standard topographic sheet costs on the order of $ 100, 000 if prepared from scratch. To justify their cost, therefore, maps must be useful for as many purposes as possible, and {{for as long as possible}} – and it follows that maps will emphasize the comparatively static features of the Earth’s surface over the dynamic ones. Topographic maps show contours, placenames, roads, railroads, rivers, and lakes, all of which are expected to remain largely the same throughout the lifetime of the map; and a GIS developed to store and manipulate such maps will also tend to favor such static features. This emphasis on the static and cross-sectional suggests that GIS will be of little interes...|$|R

40|$|Ink {{annotation}} is {{a popular}} approach for recording feedback over text documents, either on paper or over a digital document. However, we are interested whether this success can be seen when annotating program code directly within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Program code is different from text documents {{in that it is}} non-linear and therefore it can become inefficient to <b>annotate</b> over <b>printed</b> versions of code, as the reviewer must manually search through pages of code to find method declarations and object classes. Reading code within an IDE, then documenting code issues {{on a piece of paper}} or in a text editor involves frequent switching between the code and the issue list, risking a break in concentration, while also giving no direct reference point to the code, resulting in each issue requiring a higher degree of description. Lastly, coding issues should not be written directly within the IDE as a comment, as they can be difficult to distinguish from actual code comments. The ability of digital ink annotation directly in an IDE gives the reviewer a more distinguishable and intuitive annotation approach, and gives a computerized approach to improve efficiency problems seen in code review, while also retaining all the benefits an underlying code editor has to offer. In this thesis we investigate the necessary requirements for a digital ink annotation tool within the IDE, this will provide benefit to any scenario where one reads or writes code.

40|$|Document {{portability}} programs transform electronic documents into a {{state that}} allows information to be viewed, <b>annotated,</b> and <b>printed</b> by any computer system, regardless of the original computer platform or software application used to create the primary document. In addition, portable documents maintain formatting, fonts and graphics as they appear in the original. Despite the unique opportunity these programs offer for distributing information, most portable document developers do not use the technology effectively. Poor font rendering and page sizes too large for easy navigation or comfortable monitor viewing make most portable documents impractical for pure electronic use. When a document is presented on screen, it {{no longer has the}} same properties as a printed page. Though the information contained within it may not have changed, the reader has less control over the conditions under which the document will be read. It becomes the responsibility of the creator to present that information in a useful manner, if he or she wishes the information to reach its audience. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether it is possible, through simple formulaic reformatting, to create highly legible text intensive documents for on screen viewing using a document portability program, specifically Adobes Portable Document Format. This objective was achieved by determining the factors that con tribute to legibility and creating and testing various documents based on those findings. Three experiments were conducted to determine whether the portable document format is a viable medium for viewing text intensive documents on screen.

When the manuscript was returned to Massachusetts at the end of the 19th century, the Massachusetts legislature commissioned a new transcription to be published. While the version that resulted was more faithful to the idiosyncratic orthography of Bradford, it contained, according to Morison, many of the same mistakes as the transcription published in 1856. The legislature's version was published in 1898. A copy is hosted by the Internet Archive.
