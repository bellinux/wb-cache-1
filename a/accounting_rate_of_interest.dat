40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} framework for the social evaluation of projects in Bahrain by estimating a set of shadow prices and social parameters. In general, and when market distortions prevail, the use of shadow prices intends to take an economy towards an optimal allocation of resources by valuing goods and factors at their social opportunity costs. The methodology adopted for the estimation of shadow prices and social parameters is that of the "World Bank" developed by Squire and van der Tak. The World Bank approach is selected to guide the empirical work after a study of three main approaches of project evaluation, which includes in addition to the World Bank's that of Little and Mirrlees (1974) and the UNIDO Guidelines. The shadow prices estimated are those for traded goods and labour as well as some social parameters. Shadow wage rates at social prices are estimated for Bahraini and migrant labour. Social parameters are estimated for Bahraini households only and include the consumption distribution weights, the value of public income, the summary distribution measure, the critical consumption level and the <b>accounting</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The major findings derived from our empirical work are that shadow prices of traded goods are relatively high and are thus close to their market prices, shadow wage rates for Bahraini labour are mostly close to their market values, and that shadow wage rates generated by employment of migrant labour are relatively high and are clearly higher than those of Bahraini labour...|$|E

We provide evidence that in countries with greater restrictions on capital mobility, a given reduction in the inflation rate is associated with a smaller loss in output. This result is shown to be consistent with theoretical presumption from a version of the Mundell-Fleming model. Restrictions on capital mobility are measured using the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Rate Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. Estimates of the output-inflation tradeoff are taken from previous studies, viz., Lucas (1973) and Ball, Mankiw and Romer (1988).

Practically {{many of the}} SMEs finance their projects through their own funds, family funds, and friends’ funds due {{to a number of}} difficulties in accessing bank financing (MIC 2007). Non-banking institutions, non-governmental development banks, also finance SMEs. The non-banking institutions include PODE (Development of Enterprises’ Projects) that provide long-term financing in a period of 2.5 to 7  years (MIC, 2007). In addition, some other non-banking institutions focus in funding small agriculture and some other sectors. Those institutions include GAPI (Society for Management in Financing and Promoting the SMEs), FFPI (Small Industries Funding Program) which provide funds for small industries, and FARE (Funds for Aiding and Rehabilitation of the Economy) (MPD, 2007). There are a number of challenges SMEs face that prevent them from conducting their businesses effectively and efficiently. The cost of finance products in the country is high (25 – 30  %). Even if the financial market is stabilized, banks face issues of high overhead costs and this influences the price of finance products (MIE, 2010). The financial institutions have highlighted several constraints encountered by SMEs which limit the provision of finance products to SMEs. The constraints faced by SMEs are associated with the lack of clear financial plans, the <b>accounting</b> documentation, higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> and the lack of collateral requirements (MIC, 2007). There remain in the country important policy challenges on the lending side.|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 60). Modern Banking presents an extensive variety of economic services – particularly credit, funds, and payment services and carries out the widest array of economic tasks of any business firm in the financial system which is a result improvement. Earning a good image of honesty to pact with money of the shareholders is the vital characteristic of banking process. Internship program assists to attain realistic understanding along with scholastic understanding. Study is not complete without realistic details, and it helps to recognize genuine situation of study. I have obtained knowledge on General Banking procedures by getting chance as an intern in UCBL. I have worked there for three months as a prerequisite of internship part of BBA program under the Department of Business Administration of Brac University. I have chosen the subject “General Banking Activities of UCBL. ” One {{of the first generation}} commercial banks in Bangladesh is UCBL which provides expert banking services and contributes to the social and economical development of the country. After initiation of business in 1983, it has been able to set up one of the biggest networks having 148 branches in different districts. United Commercial Bank Limited intends to play a primary role in the financial activities of the country. Through adapted service, inventive practices, vibrant advance and wellorganized administration, it has made a distinct mark in the area of private banking division by now. Through an imaginative credit policy, it is also decisively occupied in the improvement of business, trade, and production. General Banking is the main point of discussion in this report. So I discussed its diagnosis and necessity. General banking operation includes general account’s opening, requirements <b>of</b> opening <b>accounts,</b> schemes, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> on deposit, cheque clearing and bills department sections, collection section, local remittance department and customer services. iv I have organized the report in the following way: In chapter – 1, the introductory terms and purposes of the report, restrictions regarding the report, tactic and source of the study are described. In chapter – 2, describes the general situation of UCBL, including the history, the market share, support, diverse actions, branch network and administration hierarchy etc. In chapter – 3, represents the overall actions of general banking and its diverse products characteristic and services. In chapter – 4, UCBL’s financial position is described here. In chapter – 5, The internship positions, duties and learning points which have done in the UCBL are shown. In chapter – 6, The SWOT analysis of UCBL is described here. In chapter – 7, 8, 9 the last chapter, is all about ending, suggestions of the report and bibliography. Humayra HaseenB.

Uncertainty concerning the length of life yields an equilibrium in which private and social <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> discount differ and budget deficits exert real effects. It is shown that a current budget deficit(resulting from a tax cut) raises world <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> On the other hand {{the direction of the}} effect of an expected future deficit on the short-term <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> depends on whether the country is having a surplus or a deficit inits current account of the balance of payments. If it runs a deficit in the current account then the short-term <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rises and vice versa; the future <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> however, must rise. It is also shown that budget deficits raise domestic wealth and lower foreign wealth and thus result in a negative transmission. In the long run, a higher steady-state value of government debt raises the steady-state world <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> but its effect on the long-run value of foreign wealth is ambiguous. The effects of changes in government spending depend on both the timing and the patterns of spending. A transitory (balanced-budget) rise in current government spending raises the current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and lowers domestic and foreign wealth while a transitory future rise in government spending lowers the current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> lowers domestic wealth and raises foreign wealth. A permanent rise in government spending lowers the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> if the current account of the balance of payments is in deficit, and vice versa. Finally, the model is generalized to a multi-commodity world and the impact of policies are shown to depend on comparison among various spending and saving propensities of private sectors and of governments. ...|$|R
