5|$|In {{both the}} Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Freyr sees Gerðr from a distance, becomes deeply lovesick <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shimmering beauty, and has his servant Skírnir go to Jötunheimr (where Gerðr {{and her father}} Gymir reside) to gain her love. In the Poetic Edda Gerðr {{initially}} refuses, yet {{after a series of}} threats by Skírnir she finally agrees. In the Prose Edda, no mention of threats are made. In both sources, Gerðr agrees to meet Freyr at a fixed time at the location of Barri and, after Skírnir returns with Gerðr's response, Freyr laments that the meeting could not occur sooner. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Gerðr is described as the daughter of Gymir and the jötunn Aurboða.|$|E

The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: [...] "I've made a conquest!" [...] Via pantomime through the glass, she kindly offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.|$|E
500|$|Mary's body {{becomes the}} {{tabernacle}} holding the Host made flesh. She becomes {{an object of}} devotion, a [...] "monstrance containing the Host". Her full belly {{and the presence of}} the dove indicate the moment of Incarnation has occurred. Viewers would have been reminded of the Crucifixion and Lamentation with the swoon, [...] "thus anticipating Christ's sacrifice for the salvation of mankind at the moment of his conception." [...] According to theologians, Mary stood with dignity at the Crucifixion of Jesus, but in 15th-century art she is depicted swooning, according to Jolly, [...] "in agony <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dying son… assuming the pose of a mother in the throes of the pain of childbirth". At the cross she felt the pain of his death; pain which at his birth she had not experienced.|$|E

500|$|The singer had a {{very close}} {{relationship}} with her paternal grandfather, Ron Cyrus, a Democratic legislator {{in the state of}} Kentucky and public servant, whom she referred to as [...] "Pappy". He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer that develops from the protective lining that covers many of the body's internal organs, and struggled with the illness for several years as result of exposure to asbestos. Cyrus then relocated from Franklin, Tennessee to Los Angeles, California to commence work on the Disney Channel original series Hannah Montana. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grandfather ailing from afar, Cyrus was inspired to compose [...] "I Miss You". In her autobiography Miles to Go (2009), she explained, [...] "That's how I ended up writing the song 'I Miss You' for Pappy. He was so sick. I knew he was dying, and slowly so did my heart. I couldn't imagine life without him." [...] She co-wrote the song with her mother's dear friends Wendy Foy Green and Brian Green, and described it as the most difficult song for her write because of the subject matter. Cyrus attempted to halt writing [...] "I Miss You", telling her co-writers she could not bear anymore.|$|E

[...] <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> daughter, {{whom she had}} not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. [...] Once {{recovered}} she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. [...] Elizabeth was described as being in a [...] "deplorable condition"; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a shift, a petticoat, and a bedgown. [...] A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. [...] According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. [...] They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. [...] She awoke [...] "by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me" [...] and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would [...] "go their way" [...] (become a prostitute). [...] Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft. [...] There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. [...] The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. [...] Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. [...] She recalled hearing the name [...] "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road. [...] On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of [...] "Mother" [...] Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, nearly [...] distant.|$|E

It states: [...] "Hugh Logan is a widower who lives with his only child, a little girl, in a small cottage in the country. Logan is a commercial traveler and, as the play opens, is preparing to leave on a business trip. He takes the train to the city, where he is attacked by footpads, who leave him unconscious in the roadway. He is found by Maud Neal and her father, who are passing in an auto, and they take him into their home. There he revives, but the shock has affected his memory, and {{he is unable to}} recall anything of his past life. The kindly Neal secures him employment, and as time passes Logan falls deeply in love with Maud. He finally proposes to her and it is accepted. In the meantime, little May has been waiting in vain for her father. As no word is received from him, and she has no other relatives, Bridget, the servant, takes her to the orphan asylum, where she is compelled to make her home with other little unfortunates. May dislikes the place. In the end she escapes from it. But, gaining the city, she gets lost there and, tired and hungry, goes to sleep on a doorstep - the Neals'. There she is found by Maud, who takes her into the house. Maud is much attracted by the child's charms and finally decides that she must never be parted from her. She tells Logan of her decision and he objects. They quarrel. Feeling himself in the wrong, Logan returns and asks Maud's pardon. He meets May, who recognizes her father. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> his memory returns. Speedily he determines to retain May from out of the things of the old life, and Maud from out of the new." ...|$|E

[...] "Their legs were up to the knees, the wide folds of their bathing skirts outlining the gracious curves of their thighs. [...] Their hair hung loose and their arms were bare. [...] They wore striped gay-colored blouses... Pale and motionless, the religious Actaeon (i.e. Padre Salvi, who was hiding in the bushes, acting as a voyeur) watched this chaste Diana (i.e. Maria Clara): his sunken eyes glistening <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> beautifully molded white arms, the graceful neck ending in a suggestion of a bosom.

2500|$|Annie saved most of {{the money}} she made cooking to start her {{catering}} business which she operated out of her restaurant, the Wayside Inn, which was located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> childhood home behind Grindstone schoolhouse. She reportedly had over 1,000 place settings of china and handled many large catered events for the University of Missouri. One of her largest banquets at an Alumni dinner for the University of Missouri she was paid 1,200 dollars at a price of two dollars per plate. Annie's beaten biscuits became so popular that Missourians who had moved out of state would mail order her biscuits to be delivered to states as far away as New York and California. Annie cooked in what she referred to as, [...] "old Missouri style," [...] which meant she used local ingredients to give her food a distinct flavor and her cooking became so popular that she began endorsing local businesses such as the Boone County Mill's H-P flour which she used in her famous biscuits. In 1911, a Sedalia hostess who handled catering for the Missouri State fair made sure Fisher's biscuits were on the presidential table for William Howard Taft's visit. Fisher's ingenuity didn't end in the kitchen, she invented a specific cutter for her biscuits that would keep them from sticking {{to the surface of the}} cutter and after Fisher's mail order business had taken off, she incorporated a biscuit brake to meet the demand for her biscuits. In a news article, Fisher reported she usually makes around one million biscuits a year and around 50 dozen biscuits every hour with the help from her daughter. By 1919, Fisher was making 500 dollars a month on selling her biscuits alone, she sold them for 15 cents a dozen. Using the profits from her cooking and catering businesses, Fisher bought her first house in 1901 and paid it off in two years. After her first property purchase, Fisher went on to buy 18 rental properties in the downtown Columbia area, most of which were along what is now Ash street and fifth street. Later after Fisher's catering business had become quite successful, she purchased a 58 acre farm outside of Columbia where she raised livestock and crops to use in her cooking.|$|E
