50|$|The {{severity}} of clinical signs and their speed of onset {{is determined by}} the dose of <b>alloantibodies</b> taken in by the foal and their potency. <b>Alloantibodies</b> against the Aa blood group are especially potent, and usually produce more severe signs than other <b>alloantibodies</b> when an equivalent dose is absorbed. Mares with multiple exposures to a blood group antigen also produce a greater amount of <b>alloantibodies</b> and therefore the foal receives a larger dose.|$|R
50|$|Some mares have natural <b>alloantibodies,</b> {{usually to}} the Ca blood group, {{without ever having}} a known {{exposure}} to that blood group. This is seen in 10% of Thoroughbred mares and 20% of Standardbred mares. In this case, Ca <b>alloantibodies</b> are thought to actually suppress a response against Aa blood groups, and therefore these mares do not make Aa <b>alloantibodies</b> if the foal has both Ca positive and Aa positive blood. These natural <b>alloantibodies</b> have not been shown to produce isoerythrolysis in foals, and are actually thought to help prevent NI by desensitization {{of the immune system}} and preventing the more harmful Aa <b>alloantibodies</b> from forming.|$|R

50|$|If intrauterine {{platelet}} transfusions are performed, {{they are}} generally repeated weekly (platelet lifespan after transfusion is approximately 8 to 10 days). Platelets administered to the fetus must be negative for the culprit antigen (often -1a, as stated above). Many blood suppliers (such as American Red Cross and United Blood Services) have identified -1a negative donors. An alternative donor is the mother who is, of course, negative for the culprit antigen. However, she must meet general criteria for donation and platelets received from the mother must be washed to remove the offending <b>alloantibody</b> and irradiated {{to reduce the risk}} of graft-versus-host disease.

Anti-K does not bind complement, therefore hemolysis is extravascular. Individuals without K antigens(K0) who have formed an antibody to a K antigen, must be transfused with blood from donors who are also K0 to prevent hemolysis.|$|E

ResultsAt kidney allograft loss, donor-specific alloantibodieswere detected in three group II patients (14. 2 %) and six group I patients (12. 5 %). At last follow-up, donor-specific <b>alloantibodies</b> were detected in 11 patients (52. 4 %) without and 39 patients (81 %) with an allograft nephrectomy (P= 0. 02).

As <b>alloantibody</b> is also highly potent when given after the antigen when an afferent mechanism is unlikely to occur, studies on the specificity of immunosuppression, particularly the likely requirement for antibody to I region determinants, would best be conducted by giving the antibody after the antigen, thereby avoiding any possible afferent inhibitory activity...|$|E
40|$|Alloantigen {{exposure}} typically provokes {{an adaptive}} immune response that can foster rejection of transplanted organs, and these responses present the most formidable biological barrier to kidney transplantation.

The properties of this <b>alloantibody</b> were indistinguishable from those of <b>alloantibody</b> induced by conventional immunization procedures.

These phenomena occurred in 'responder' and 'non-responder' female strains (referring to the ability of allogeneically mated females to produce anti-paternal <b>alloantibody</b> during normal pregnancy) demonstrating that they do not differ in their ability to produce a secondary immune response to alloantigens presented via the intrauterine route.

Experiments were performed using normal mice, MHC class II- deficient mice, MHC class II-deficient mice with an intact peripheral CD 4 + cell population (due to expression of class II antigens only on thymic epithelium), mice lacking the cytoplasmic tail of their MHC class II antigens, and mice depleted of CD 4 + cells by anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibody treatment. Depletion of recipient CD 4 + cells reduced <b>alloantibody</b> production to barely detectable levels. Absence of donor MHC class II antigens {{did not affect the}} production of either immunoglobulin (Ig) M or IgG antibodies directed at class I alloantigens. Absence of recipient MHC class II antigens, however, led to production of only IgM but not IgG antibodies, even if the recipients had an intact CD 4 + cell population. Absence of the cytoplasmic tail of the recipient's MHC class II antigens led to the production of slightly reduced amounts of IgG antibody. These findings indicate that (a) CD 4 + cells are essential helper cells for B cell <b>alloantibody</b> production; (b) production of IgM <b>alloantibody</b> can occur with help from CD 4 + cells, which recognize either donor class II antigens or modified recipient class II antigens; (c) isotype switching from IgM to IgG <b>alloantibody</b> requires help from CD 4 + cells activated by antigens presented by recipient MHC class II molecules; and (d) the cytoplasmic domain of the recipient MHC class II molecules may be involved in the mechanism that leads to isotype switching by B cells.

However, the majority of transfused individuals never form detectable <b>alloantibodies.</b> Expanding upon observations that children initially transfused with RBCs at a young age are less likely to form <b>alloantibodies</b> throughout their lives, we hypothesized that “non-responders” may not only be ignorant of antigens on RBCs but instead tolerized. We investigated this question in a reductionist murine model, in which transgenic donors express the human glycophorin A (hGPA) antigen in an RBC-specific manner. Although wild-type mice treated with poly IC and transfused with hGPA RBCs generated robust anti-hGPA IgG <b>alloantibodies</b> that led to rapid clearance of incompatible RBCs, those transfused {{in the absence of an}} adjuvant failed to become alloimmunized. Animals depleted of CD 4 + cells or treated with CD 40 L blockade prior to initial hGPA RBC exposure, in the presence of poly IC, failed to generate detectable anti-hGPA IgG <b>alloantibodies.</b> These non-responders to a primary transfusion remained unable to generate anti-hGPA IgG <b>alloantibodies</b> upon secondary hGPA exposure and did not prematurely clear transfused hGPA RBCs even after their CD 4 cells had returned or their CD 40 L blockade had resolved. This observed tolerance was antigen (hGPA) specific, as robust IgG responses to transfused RBCs expressing a third-party antigen occurred in all studied groups. Experiments completed in an RBC alloimmunization model that allowed evaluation of antigen-specific CD 4 + T-cells (HOD (hen egg lysozyme, ovalbumin, and human duffyb)) demonstrated that CD 40 L blockade prevented the expansion of ovalbumin 323 - 339 specific T-cells after HOD RBC transfusion and also prevented germinal center formation. Taken together, our data suggest that recipients may indeed become tolerized to antigens expressed on RBCs, with the recipient’s immune status upon initial RBC exposure dictating future responses. Although questions surrounding mechanism(s) and sustainability of tolerance remain, these data lay the groundwork for future work investigating RBC immunity versus tolerance in reductionist models and in humans...|$|R

The finding of anti-idiotypes against anti-VIII:C <b>alloantibodies</b> in IVIg suggests that, in addition to autoantibodies, some <b>alloantibodies</b> may be suppressed in vivo by IVIg...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neonatal alloimmune-mediated {{neutropenia}} (NAIN) due to maternal <b>alloantibodies</b> {{directed against}} one of the human neutrophil antigens (HNAs) can cause severe infections. NAIN has been described as caused by antibodies against HNA- 1 a, -b, -c, - 2 a, - 3 a, or - 4 a, but not by antibodies against HNA- 5 a. RESULTS: Blood from a 3 -week-old newborn and from his parents was sent to our laboratory because of suspicion of NAIN. Granulocyte-specific antibodies were present in the maternal antiserum and reactive with the paternal granulocytes. The specificity of the maternal <b>alloantibodies</b> was shown to be anti-HNA- 5 a by the monoclonal antibody immobilization of granulocyte antigens assay. The mother was genotyped HNA- 5 a negative, and the father was genotyped homozygous HNA- 5 a positive. CONCLUSION: We identified a first case of NAIN due to maternal <b>alloantibodies</b> against HNA- 5...|$|R
