40|$|Bill, a third-year medical student, {{had just}} started his {{internal}} medicine clerkship rotation. Seriously considering a career in primary care medicine, Bill was eager {{to be exposed to}} as many clinical scenarios as possible during this two-month rotation. The first patient he was assigned to care for was Mr. Wolfe, who came to the emergency room with shortness of breath and was subsequently admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF). Mr. Wolfe responded well to medical treatment, and Bill was able to learn firsthand how to care for CHF patients. Because Mr. Wolfe was 68 and this was his second hospitalization in the last 9 months for CHF exacerbation, the resident physician in charge wanted Bill to make sure that Mr. Wolfe understood the importance of taking his medications and limiting his sodium intake. As a result of their many conversations, Bill developed a good rapport with Mr. Wolfe. On the day that Mr. Wolfe was being discharged, Bill visited to see if he had any questions and to wish him well. Mr. Wolfe thanked Bill for his attention and care and before parting ways said, “I’ve been meaning to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> button you’ve been wearing. ” Bill explained, “It’s a Human Rights Campaign pin. The HRC works to ensure that gay and lesbian Americans have equal basic rights, including the right to marriage. ” Mr. Wolfe paused before muttering “Uh, OK. Thanks for stopping by. ” Later that day, Bill told his classmate Anna about his conversation with Mr. Wolfe, saying, “It was so disappointing. I really like Mr. Wolfe and felt like we had a great relationship. Then he asked about my pin and acted weird when I said what it was. ” Bill added that he thought HRC’s mission was an important one for doctors to support because social stigmatization of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people could have detrimental health effects. Anna said, “But if it makes some patients uncomfortable, maybe it’s better if you just stop wearing the pin at work. ” Commentary When approaching this case, it’s important to begin by ruling out a common piece of nonsense. We often hear people refer to any controversial issue as “political, ” an...|$|E

A/C Judson ClarkSqdrn 5 Class 45 -ACadet DetachmentStewart FieldNewburgh, New York [Transcription begins]:Sunday nite Dearest Judson, Golly, here another weekend {{has just}} flown by. Can’t you do {{something}} to slow them down a little and hurry the week in between them. Ever since you said {{that we might be}} mistaking good friendship for love, I’ve been worrying. That may be the way you feel and that’s what I’m afraid of. I know that’s not the way it is with me, though. I’m sure of that. Honey, your mother and sister are really swell. They’re real nice 2 ̆ 6 loads of fun—I like them an awful lot. We had quite a talk about you on the way home. They’re both crazy about you—(me, too) (I mean I’m crazy about you, too) —I really am. You’re so sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful and just wonderful in general. You said you were afraid of getting serious. Why are you afraid? I meant to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> What’s wrong with that? The only thing is that I’m terribly afraid of falling too hard and getting hurt. It seems to me that someplace I read that the real kind of love was the kind that started or had a real good friendship, too. Oh, well, time alone will tell. Darling, I miss you already. You’ve only been away for a few hours and it seems months already. If this is friendship—well, I don’t think I’ve ever had that kind of a feeling for any friend. There were so darned many things I wanted to write you but now that I’m actually writing all I can think of is how much I love you and miss you. Every weekend seems to be nicer than the one before that. Just being with you is so wonderful. You’re so sweet. (I could go on like that all night). Oh, before I forget. This is really an effort to get my mind away from you for a while. Was talking to Woody and she has to go to school this Saturday morning until one or something like that. But anyhow. Do you think you can get a date with that fellow you were telling me about for her for Saturday night? What would you like to do, honey, anything special? Let’s go easy on your money for a change. I hate to have you spend so much on me. Oh, yes, how about going out with your Mom 2 ̆ 6 sister because I’m sure they’d enjoy seeing you a little bit more. Your Mom is swell about your going out all the time but I think if you took her too she’d enjoy it an awful lot. What do you think? Judson, I’m afraid I’m too serious already. Honestly, it’s really getting pretty bad. Remind me to be more aloof next time I see you. Another thing, remind me to tell you how wonderful you are, too. This letter is slightly different from the ones I usually write, isn’t it. Seems to be in a rut. Oh, yes, please answer all the questions I ask you. I hate people who just ignore questions. It drives me crazy. Don’t forget about your promise not to fly over Pelham unless it’s legal. Please don’t forget about it because I know how much the air corps 2 ̆ 6 flying means to you and I’d hate to see anything happen because of a few minutes of pleasure. Golly, I could just write all night about how much I miss you and everything but you’d get very bored reading it no doubt. Do you have that 40 hour check this week? Please be careful, honey, on that cross-country thing. Take care of yourself. I love you. Lots of love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
