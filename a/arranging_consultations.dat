40|$|Genetic {{counseling}} plays a {{key role}} in the BRCA 1 /BRCA 2 and hMLH 1 /hMSH 2 /hMSH 6 testing process. The initial genetic counselling encounter will determine the appropriateness of the test by collecting a detailed family history and determining the likelihood that the family has a BRCA 1 /BRCA 2, hMLH 1 /hMSH 2 /hMSH 6 mutation. Once the test is offered, then genetic counselling discussions center around the possible test results, implications of the patient and other relatives, and risk and benefits of testing. The goal of this pre-test genetic counseling session is to ensure that patients have sufficient information with which to make a decision about being tested. At results disclosure, individuals can learn their results along with information about cancer risks and medical management options. Follow-up genetic counseling services can provide continued support and help <b>arrange</b> <b>consultations</b> with other medical care providers as needed.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the role of}} promotoras—briefly trained community health workers—in depression care at community health centers. The intervention focused on four contextual sources of depression in underserved, low-income communities: underemployment, inadequate housing, food insecurity, and violence. A multi-method design included quantitative and ethnographic techniques to study predictors of depression and the intervention’s impact. After a structured training program, primary care practitioners (PCPs) and promotoras collaboratively followed a clinical algorithm in which PCPs prescribed medications and/or <b>arranged</b> <b>consultations</b> by mental health professionals and promotoras addressed the contextual sources of depression. Based on an intake interview with 464 randomly recruited patients, 120 patients with depression were randomized to enhanced care plus the promotora contextual intervention, or to enhanced care alone. All four contextual problems emerged as strong predictors of depression (chi square, p < . 05); logistic regression revealed housing and food insecurity {{as the most important}} predictors (odds ratios both 2. 40, p < . 05). Unexpected challenges arose in the intervention’s implementation, involving infrastructure at the health centers, boundaries of the promotoras’ roles, and “turf” issues with medical assistants. In the quantitative assessment, the intervention did not lead to statistically significant improvements in depression (odds ratio 4. 33, confidence interval overlapping 1). Ethnographic research demonstrated a predominantly positive response to the intervention among stakeholders, including patients, promotoras, PCPs, non-professional staff workers, administrators, and community advisory board members.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Move for Change is {{an online}} pan-European patient survey {{based on the}} European Parkinson's Disease Association (EPDA) Charter for People with Parkinson's Disease (PD), which states that all PD {{patients}} have the right to: be referred to a doctor with a specialist interest in PD; receive an accurate diagnosis; have access to support services; receive continuous care; and take part in managing their illness. METHODS: This part of the survey focuses on the final two elements of the Charter. It was administered online through the EPDA website and through affiliated patient associations' websites. A total of 1591 questionnaires were received and 1546 were analysed (97. 2 %). RESULTS: Approximately half of the patients (53. 0 %) consulted a neurologist regularly (every 4 - 6 months). <b>Consultations</b> were usually <b>arranged</b> {{as part of a}} follow-up process (65. 5 %) and lasted for 15 - 30 min (63. 2 %), with 16. 1 % lasting 30 min. Patients were largely satisfied with the attention they received (63. 2 %) but just 11. 6 % of patients were involved in treatment decisions, and 39. 1 % prepared a list of symptom changes for discussion. Two hundred caregivers also took part in the survey, and 71. 4 % felt included in the treatment plan by the doctor. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that PD disease-management is driven by the clinician; he/she <b>arranges</b> <b>consultations</b> and makes the majority of management decisions, rather than patients being included in the process. This survey can be used to raise awareness for PD patients, encouraging greater involvement in the management of PD...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Homonymous quadrantanopsia {{results from}} retrochiasmal lesions {{in the visual}} pathway. Invasive mole is a benign tumor that arises from myometrial {{invasion}} of a hydatidiform mole via direct extension through tissue or venous channels. Cerebral metastasis of invasive mole is rare {{and there has been}} no report demonstrating homonymous quadrantanopsia as the first manifestation of metastasis in any trophoblastic neoplasms. Case presentation We report the case of a 31 -year-old Asian woman who presented with right homonymous inferior quadrantanopsia from the mass effect of a solitary cerebral metastasis from an invasive mole. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain showed a metastatic tumor in the left occipital lobe. The visual field improved slightly after chemotherapy. There was a reduction in the tumor size and the surrounding edema. This is the first case report demonstrating that homonymous quadrantanopsia {{should be included in the}} manifestations of the metastasis of an invasive mole. Conclusions The presentation of homonymous quadrantanopsia must alert ophthalmologists to conduct a complete medical history and <b>arrange</b> specialist <b>consultation.</b> </p...|$|R

60|$|It was no very {{difficult}} {{matter for the}} Earl to divert the King's attention from {{the matter of the}} feast. His Majesty was very intent just then upon supplying a quota of troops to the Dauphin, and the chief object of his visit to Devlen was to open negotiations with the Earl looking to that end. He was interested--much interested in Myles and in the coming jousting in which the young warrior was to prove himself, but he was interested in it by way of a relaxation from the other and more engrossing matter. So, though he made some passing and half preoccupied inquiry about the feast he was easily satisfied with the Earl's reasons for not holding it: which were that he had <b>arranged</b> a <b>consultation</b> for that morning in regard to the troops for the Dauphin, to which meeting he had summoned a number of his own more important dependent nobles, that the King himself needed repose and the hour or so of rest that his barber-surgeon had ordered him to take after his mid-day meal; that Father Thomas had laid upon Myles a petty penance--that for the first three days of his knighthood he should eat his meals without meat and in his own apartment--and various other reasons equally good and sufficient.

40|$|The {{psychology}} service programme {{was implemented}} at the Kalafong Paediatric HIV Clinic. The {{students from the}} Department of Psychology from the University of Pretoria were involved. The aim {{of the study was}} to explore, explain and describe the experiences of the personnel at the Clinic during the implementation of the programme in terms of an interpretive narrative framework. A qualitative research design was used. The primary source of data collection was through interviews. Interpreting experience took place at Reissman’s five levels of representation and Labov’s six elements for data reduction and interpretation were used. The emerged interpretive categories were presented as questions. The study found that the multidisciplinary team identified the need for psychological intervention, more so during the time when some of the adolescent patients had discovered that they were HIV positive. The patients were struggling to cope with the reality of accepting the diagnosis. The study noted the challenges that were experienced during the implementation, as well as the highlights.

To review evidence and to investigate current clinical practice in pain assessment and management in PWH the European Haemophilia Therapy Standardisation Board undertook a literature review and a survey in 22 Haemophilia Treatment Centres (HTC), using a questionnaire and seven clinical scenarios. Consensus was sought on pain assessment and management in PWH. Few clinical studies on pain management in PWH were identified. The HTCs care for 1678 children (47 % severe haemophilia, 84 % on prophylaxis, 17 % with arthropathy and 8 % with chronic pain) and 5103 adults (44 % severe haemophilia, 40 % on prophylaxis, 67 % with arthropathy and 35 % with chronic pain). Analgesics are prescribed by HTCs in 80 % of cases (median; range 0 - 100 %) and in 10 % (median; range 0 - 80 %) are bought over the counter. Pain and analgesic use are assessed when reported by patients and at check-ups. Only eight centres use a specific pain scale and/or have specific pain guidelines. Two HTCs <b>arrange</b> regular <b>consultations</b> with pain specialists. For acute pain, the preferred first-line drug is paracetamol for children, and paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for adults.

40|$|In Denmark the {{provision}} of out of hours care by general practitioners came under increasing pressure in the 1980 s because of growing demand for services by the public and increasing complaints from rural doctors about their heavy workload and disproportionately low remuneration in comparison with urban doctors. As a result, the out of hours service was reformed {{at the start of}} 1992 : locally negotiated rota systems were replaced with county based services. Each county now has a coordination centre, where all patients' calls are received by a team of doctors. The doctors may give a telephone consultation, advise the patient to attend one of the emergency clinics strategically placed about the county, or arrange for a home visit. Doctors on home visiting duty are located at bases throughout the county and keep in touch with the coordination centre with mobile telephones. Graded fees mean that doctors are encouraged to give telephone <b>consultations</b> rather than <b>arrange</b> for clinic <b>consultations</b> or home visits.

40|$|IN 1954 COOPERATIVE STUDIES were {{begun by}} a {{psychiatrist}} (M. G.) and an intern-ist (J. V. T.) {{that led to}} a new technique of psychiatric consultation (1). These consul-tations were conducted in the internist's office with the internist present. Instead of being sent into the new and foreboding environment of a psychiatrist's office, the patient would come to the familiar situa-tion of his internist's office where he was more at ease and had less tendency to de-velop special defenses. Our original consultations involved three individuals: the patient, the consulting psy-chiatrist, who as guest in the internist's office was the central figure, and the intern-ist, who was the host. This three-cornered arrangement, referred to as "the psycho-somatic triangle, " offered the advantage of continuing the doctor-patient relationship as it had been established before the con-sultant appeared. Thus, the visiting psy-chiatrist entered this relationship, made himself a part of it, used it to best advan-tage as he saw fit, and then stepped out of it again, if handled properly, without sig-nificant disturbance. The flow of associa-tion was easier, more spontaneous, and of milder intensity {{than it would have been}} in the psychiatrist's office. Although the evaluation was psychiatric, the atmosphere remained medical, centering around the medical problem. The advantages of this method of psy-chiatric consultation for each of the three participants have been discussed in detail previously (1). Suffice it to say that the in-ternist found that he could <b>arrange</b> these <b>consultations</b> with ease, avoiding the re-sistance of sending his patient to a psychia-trist; and the psychiatrist, by being called in to see many patients he would not ordi-narily see, obtained a broader view of psy-chosomatic problems in general, of border-line cases of normality, and of some very sick psychotic patients, earlier, before their breaking point. From the patient's stand-point, the joint consultation in the intern-ist's office gave him direct understanding of the inextricable interaction of his physi-cal and emotional problems...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Chest pain is {{a common}} reason for an {{encounter}} in general practice. The present investigation was set out to characterize the consultation rate of chest pain, accompanying symptoms, frequency of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and results of the encounter. Materials and Methods: Cross‑sectional {{data were collected from}} randomly selected patients in the German Sächsische Epidemiologische Studie in der Allgemeinmedizin 2 (SESAM 2) and analyzed from the Dutch Transition Project. Results: Overall, 270 patients from the SESAM 2 study consulted a general practitioner due to chest pain (3 % of all consultations). Chest pain was more frequent in people aged over 45 years. The most common diagnostic interventions were physical examination, electrocardiogram at rest and analysis of blood parameters. For the majority of cases, the physicians <b>arranged</b> a follow‑up <b>consultation</b> or prescribed drugs. The transition project documented 8117 patients reporting chest pain with a frequency of 44. 5 / 1000 patient years (1. 7 % of all consultations). Physical examination was also the most common diagnostic intervention, and physician’s advice the most relevant therapeutic one. Conclusion: The most common causes for chest pain were musculoskeletal problems followed by cardiovascular diseases. Ischemic heart disease, psychogenic problems, and respiratory diseases each account for about 10 % of the cases. However, acutely dangerous causes are rare in general practice...|$|R
40|$|M. Cur. (Professional Nursing Science: Nursing Education) One of the {{strategic}} priorities for the National Health System 2004 - 2009 {{is to have a}} 15 - 20 % {{increase in the number of}} nursing students to address both equity requirements and changing human resources, and to meet the health needs of the nation (National Plan of Higher Education, 2001 : 2). At the nursing college under study, this increase in nursing student numbers has led to a number of teaching and learning problems, as reported in the college study (Waterson, Harms, Qupe, Maritz, Manning, Makobe & Chabeli, 2006 b: 70). Nurse educators encourage students to <b>arrange</b> individual <b>consultations</b> to attend to their learning problems. The purpose of the study was to explore and describe the perceptions of nursing students and nurse educators on factors they perceive to be contributing to ineffective teaching and learning in large groups, and to describe strategies to improve this situation at a nursing college in Johannesburg. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, and contextual research design was employed to obtain a deeper understanding of nursing students’ and nurse educators’ perceptions that contribute to ineffective teaching and learning in large classes. A purposive sampling method was used for the first-year nursing students in a Johannesburg nursing college. Focus group interviews with nursing students and nurse educators were conducted by the expert interviewer. Open coding qualitative data analysis methods were used in accordance with Tech’s qualitative method (Creswell, 2012 : 186). Credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability were used to ensure trustworthiness in accordance with Lincoln and Guba’s model (1985 : 290 - 326).

We aimed to determine the incidence of medically-attended respiratory illnesses (MARI) in pregnant women {{and the proportion of}} women who are tested for respiratory pathogens at these visits. We conducted a nested retrospective cohort study of a non-random sample of women aged ≥ 18 years who had a live birth in maternity units in Brisbane, Queensland, from March 2012 to October 2014. The primary outcomes were self-reported doctor visits for MARI and laboratory investigations for respiratory pathogens. Descriptive analyses were performed. Among 1202 participants, 222 (18. 5 %, 95 %CI 16. 3 %- 20. 7 %) self-reported MARI during their pregnancy. Of those with an MARI, 20. 3 % (45 / 222) self-reported a laboratory test was performed. We were able to confirm with health service providers that 46. 7 % (21 / 45) of tests were undertaken, responses from providers were not received for the remainder. Whilst one in five women in this population reported a MARI in pregnancy, only 3. 7 % (45 / 1202) reported a clinical specimen had been <b>arranged</b> at the <b>consultation</b> and the ability to validate that self-report was problematic.

40|$|Objectives Practice {{nurses in}} general {{practices}} suboptimally adhere to smoking cessation guidelines. Since {{the effectiveness of}} their smoking cessation support is greatest when full adherence to these guidelines is achieved, interventions need to be developed to improve practice nurses' guideline adherence, for example, by tailoring their content to adherence determinants. However, the sociocognitive determinants explaining adherence have not yet been investigated. Therefore, this qualitative needs assessment aimed to explore practice nurses' current counselling practices, as well as their sociocognitive beliefs related to their smoking cessation guideline adherence and their needs regarding web-based adherence support. Setting Primary care; general practices in the Netherlands. Participants 19 practice nurses, actively involved in smoking cessation counselling. Methods Semistructured individual interviews, based on the I-Change Model and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory, were conducted from May to September 2014. Data were systematically analysed using the Framework Method and considered reliable (κ 0. 77; % agreement 99 %). Results Respondents felt able to be empathic and collaborative during smoking cessation consultations. They also reported psychological (eg, low self-efficacy to increase patient motivation and <b>arranging</b> adequate follow-up <b>consultations)</b> and practical barriers (eg, outdated information on quit support compensation and a perceived lack of high-quality trainings for practice nurses) to smoking cessation guideline adherence. Most respondents were interested in web-based adherence support to overcome these barriers. Conclusions Sociocognitive determinants influence practice nurses' smoking cessation guideline adherence. To improve their adherence, web-based tailored adherence support can provide practice nurses with personally relevant feedback tailored to individually perceived barriers to smoking cessation guideline adherence. More specifically, low self-efficacy levels can be increased by peer modelling (eg, presenting narratives of colleagues) and up-to-date information can be presented online, enabling practice nurses to use it during patient consultations, resulting in more effective communication with their smoking patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite efforts {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} the prehospital delay and treatment delay, a considerable proportion of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) present late and receive the reperfusion therapy after unacceptably long time periods. This study aimed at finding out the patients' decision delay, prehospital delay, door-to-electrocardiography (ECG), door-to-needle, and door-to-primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) times and their determinants among STEMI patients. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted among 96 patients with STEMI admitted in a tertiary care center in South India. The data were collected using interview of the patients and review of records. The distribution of the data was assessed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and the comparisons of the patients' decision delay, prehospital delay, and time to start reperfusion therapy with the different variables were done using Mann–Whitney U-test or Kruskal–Wallis test {{based on the number}} of groups. Results: The mean (standard deviation) and median (range) age of the participants were 55 (11) years and 57 (51) years, respectively. The median patients' decision delay, prehospital delay, door-to-ECG, door-to-needle, and door-to-primary PCI times were 75, 290, 12, 75, 110 min, respectively. Significant factors associated (P < 0. 05) with patients' decision delay were alcoholism, symptom progression, and attempt at symptom relief measures at home. Prehospital delay was significantly associated (P < 0. 05) with domicile, difficulty in <b>arranging</b> money, prior <b>consultation</b> at study center, place of symptom onset, symptom interpretation, and mode of transportation. Conclusions: The prehospital delay time among the South Indian population is still unacceptably high. Public education, improving the systems of prehospital care, and measures to improve the patient flow and management in the emergency department are essentially required. The time taken to take ECG and to initiate reperfusion therapy in this study points to scope for improvement to meet the American Heart Association recommended timings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Waiting time is {{an index}} {{assessing}} patient satisfaction, managerial effectiveness and horizontal equity in providing health care. Although heart surgery centers establishment is attractive for politicians. They are always {{faced with the}} question of to what extent they solve patient’s problems. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate factors influencing waiting time in patients of heart surgery centers, and to make recommendations for health-care policy-makers for reducing waiting time and increasing the quality of services from this perspective. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2013. After searching articles on PubMed, Elsevier, Google Scholar, Ovid, Magiran, IranMedex, and SID, a list of several criteria, which relate to waiting time, was provided. Afterwards, the data on waiting time were collected by a researcher-structured checklist from 156 hospitalized patients. The data were analyzed by SPSS 16. The Kolmogorov Smirnov and Shapiro tests were used for determination of normality. Due to the non-normal distribution, non-parametric tests, such as Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney were chosen for reporting significance. Parametric tests also used reporting medians. Results: Among the studied variables, just economic status had a significant relation with waiting time (P = 0. 37). Fifty percent of participants had diabetes, whereas this estimate was 43. 58 % for high blood pressure. As the cause of delay, 28. 2 % of patients reported financial problems, 18. 6 % personal problem and 13. 5 % a delay in providing equipment by the hospital. Conclusions: It seems the studied hospital should review its waiting time arrangements and detach them, as far as possible, from subjective and personal (specialists) decisions. On the other hand, ministries of health and insurance companies should consider more financial support. It is also recommend that hospitals should <b>arrange</b> preoperational psychiatric <b>consultation</b> for increasing patients’ emotionally readiness. © 2015, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal...|$|R
60|$|And, then, {{during these}} three days there arose another question, the {{discussion}} of which embarrassed him not a little. Mr. Westmacott was in the town, {{and there was a}} question whether he and Mr. Westmacott were to join forces. It was understood that Mr. Westmacott and Mr. Westmacott's leading friends objected to this; but the chairmen of the young men, and the presidents and the secretaries on the Radical side put their heads together, and declared that if Mr. Westmacott were proud they would run their horse alone;--they would vote for Moggs, and for Moggs only. Or else,--as it was whispered,--they would come to terms with Griffenbottom, and see that Sir Thomas was sent back to London. The chairmen, and the presidents, and the secretaries were powerful enough to get the better of Mr. Westmacott, and large placards were printed setting forward the joint names of Westmacott and Moggs. The two liberal candidates were to employ the same agent, and were to canvass together. This was all very well,--was the very thing which Moggs should have desired. But it was all <b>arranged</b> without any <b>consultation</b> with him, and he felt that the objection which had been raised was personal to himself. Worse than all, when he was brought face to face with Mr. Westmacott he had not a word to say for himself! He tried it and failed. Mr. Westmacott {{had been a member of}} Parliament, and was a gentleman. Ontario, for aught he himself knew, might have called upon Mr. Westmacott for the amount of Mr. Westmacott's little bill. He caught himself calling Mr. Westmacott, sir, and almost wished that he could bite out his own tongue. He felt that he was a nobody in the interview, and that the chairmen, the secretaries, and the presidents were regretting their bargain, and saying among themselves that they had done very badly in bringing down Ontario Moggs as a candidate for their borough. There were moments before he left Percycross in which he was almost tempted to resign.|$|R

I should like {{to say a few words}} before we separate. You young men, lads and lasses, will in a few years have a paramount influence in Stokebridge; upon you it depends whether that place is to be, as it used to be, like other colliery villages in Staffordshire, or to be a place inhabited by decent and civilized people. I am delighted to observe that a great change has lately come over it, due in a great measure to your good and kind friends Mr. and Mrs. Dodgson, who have devoted their whole time and efforts to your welfare." [...] The cheering at this point was as great as that which had greeted Mr. Brook himself, but was even surpassed by that which burst out when a young fellow shouted out, [...] "and Jack Simpson." [...] During this Jack Simpson savagely made his way out of the tent, and remained outside, muttering threats about punching heads, till the proceedings were over. [...] "And Jack Simpson," [...] Mr. Brook went on, smiling, after the cheering had subsided. [...] "I feel sure that the improvement will be maintained. When you see the comfort of homes in which the wives are cleanly, tidy, and intelligent, able to make the dresses of themselves and their children, and to serve their husbands with decently cooked food; and in which the husbands spend their evenings and their wages at home, treating their wives as rational beings, reading aloud, or engaged in cheerful conversation, and compare their homes with those of the drunkard and the slattern, it would seem impossible for any reasonable human being to hesitate in his or her choice between them. It is in your power, my friends, each and all, which of these homes shall be yours. I have thought that some active amusement is necessary, and have <b>arranged,</b> after <b>consultation</b> with your vicar and with Mr. and Mrs. Dodgson, that a choir-master from Birmingham shall come over twice a week, to train such of you as may wish and may have voices, in choir-singing. As the lads of Stokebridge can beat those of any of the surrounding villages at cricket, so I hope in time the choir of the lads and lasses of this place will be able to hold its own against any other." [...] Again the speaker had to pause, for the cheering was enthusiastic. [...] "And now, good-night; and may I say that I hope and trust that when the fireworks, which will now be displayed, are over, you will all go home and straight to bed, without being tempted to join in the doings at the feast. If so, it will be a satisfaction to me to think that for the first time since the feast was first inaugurated, neither lad nor lass of Stokebridge will have cause to look back upon the feast-day with regret or shame." ...|$|R
40|$|Context This {{improvement}} {{project was}} set in a single general practice in rural Lincolnshire, East Midlands, UK. All doctors and practice staff were actively engaged in reducing inappropriate long term prescribing of hypnotic drugs in the practice population {{as part of a}} Quality Improvement Collaborative (QIC). Problem Hypnotic drugs are only licensed for short term use but inappropriate long-term prescribing of hypnotics is common. Evidence from previous studies shows that hypnotics have limited therapeutic value and potential for significant adverse cognitive and psychiatric effects. Although there is evidence for hypnotic drug withdrawal programmes there have been few improvement projects showing whether and how this might work in practice. Assessment of problem and analysis of its causes Baseline rates of hypnotic prescribing were analysed and charted using statistical process control (SPC) methods. Patients on repeat prescriptions of hypnotic drugs were identified from the practice database. Causes, solutions and barriers were determined using surveys and focus groups of patients and staff. A withdrawal programme was implemented for all patients on long term hypnotics by writing to patients, <b>arranging</b> a <b>consultation,</b> making a detailed assessment and using techniques such as tapering doses of drugs and using cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) during general practice consultations. The improvement was supported by a QIC called REST (Resources for Effective Sleep Treatment) which supported the practice team to implement sleep assessment and management tools using plan-do-study-act cycles, process mapping and new protocols. Strategy for change The change was coordinated in the practice over six months, with each practitioner maintaining an agreed and consistent approach for managing sleep problems. All staff including doctors, nurses, administrative staff and practice manager took part. Patients were informed of the planned alteration to their treatment for their sleeping problem via a letter detailing exactly how the new regime would be implemented alongside the reasons for this. Patients were offered an appointment to discuss the proposed changes with their GP and all did so. Measurement of improvement We measured improvement by analysing prescribing rates using statistical process control charts. We also surveyed patients and conducted a focus group to explore the patients’ personal experiences of the new service the support they received during the withdrawal programme and how they manage their sleep now. Effects of changes There was a significant reduction in hypnotic prescribing of benzodiazepines (664. 9 to 62. 0 ADQ per 1000 -STAR-PU) and Z drugs (2156. 7 to 120. 1 A ADQ per STAR-PU) in the practice over the six months of the project and this improvement has been sustained since the initiative. Some patients were initially unhappy about being taken off sleeping tablets but with the approach described were successfully withdrawn. No patients are now prescribed long term benzodiazepines or Z drugs for sleep difficulties in the practice. Psychological treatments for the management of sleep problems are used first-line instead of hypnotics. The transition from hypnotics to psychological treatments is evidence of improvement in patient care. Lessons learnt It is possible to implement a hypnotic withdrawal programme over {{a relatively short period of}} time in general practice using a carefully constructed programme applied consistently by staff comprising a letter to patients, tapering of drugs and CBTi supported through education of practitioners in sleep management and quality improvement methods. Message for others Key factors for success in this improvement project were a motivated practice team, a range of solutions which could be adapted locally, expert support on sleep management and quality improvement methods and feedback of results. We will present further data on the experience of patients in this improvement project...|$|R
