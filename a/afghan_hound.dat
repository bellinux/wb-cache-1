5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult <b>Afghan</b> <b>hound.</b> As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E

50|$|Europeans first {{described}} {{the type of}} dog the Basenji breed derives from in 1895—in the Congo. These local dogs, which Europeans identified as a unique breed and called basenji, were prized by locals for their intelligence, courage, speed, and silence. An article published called The Intelligence of Dogs by Stanley Coren, Ph.D. questions this. It ranks the breed at #78 out of 79, which is the second to lowest rank in intelligence. Some consider this an unreliable list, as it focuses on only the ability {{to listen to a}} first command. Some consider independent dogs such as Basenjis and <b>Afghan</b> <b>Hounds</b> more intelligent than obedient breeds because of their ability to recognize which actions benefit them, and which simply please another.|$|R
25|$|The {{study found}} {{distinct}} genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to phenotype or function.

40|$|Extract] Laryngeal {{paralysis}} is characterised by {{a failure}} of {{one or both of}} the arytenoids to move during the respiratory cycle. Failure of abduction during inspiration causes an obstruction to airflow. The disease is usually a consequence of failure of innervation to the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, rather than primary muscle disease. The condition is commonly encountered in old Labrador Retrievers, <b>Afghan</b> <b>Hounds</b> and some other large breeds. Males are more frequently affected than females and most affected Labradors are older than 10 years. Laryngeal paralysis is usually considered to be a manifestation of a more generalised polyneuropathy. There is no compelling association with hypothyroidism. Congenital laryngeal paralysis occurs in Bouvier des Flandres as an autosomal dominant trait. Trauma and neoplasia are rather less common causes, although thyroid carcinomas and cranial mediastinal tumours can certainly cause laryngeal paralysis...|$|R
5000|$|The Tobet (төбет, [...] ), {{also known}} as the Kazakhstan {{mountain}} dog, is a molosser-type livestock guardian breed of dog with ancient origins in Kazakhstan.

40|$|High genetic {{diversity}} of East Asian village dogs {{has recently been}} used to argue for an East Asian origin of the domestic dog. However, global village dog {{genetic diversity}} {{and the extent to}} which semiferal village dogs represent distinct, indigenous populations instead of admixtures of various dog breeds has not been quantified. Understanding these issues is critical to properly reconstructing the timing, number, and locations of dog domestication. To address these questions, we sampled 318 village dogs from 7 regions in Egypt, Uganda, and Namibia, measuring genetic diversity > 680 bp of the mitochondrial D-loop, 300 SNPs, and 89 microsatellite markers. We also analyzed breed dogs, including putatively African breeds (<b>Afghan</b> <b>hounds,</b> Basenjis, Pharaoh hounds, Rhodesian ridgebacks, and Salukis), Puerto Rican street dogs, and mixed breed dogs from the United States. Village dogs from most African regions appear genetically distinct from non-native breed and mixed-breed dogs, although some individuals cluster genetically with Puerto Rican dogs or United States breed mixes instead of with neighboring village dogs. Thus, African village dogs are a mosaic of indigenous dogs descended from early migrants to Africa, and non-native, breed-admixed individuals. Among putatively African breeds, Pharaoh hounds, and Rhodesian ridgebacks clustered with non-native rather than indigenous African dogs, suggesting they have predominantly non-African origins. Surprisingly, we find similar mtDNA haplotype diversity in African and East Asian village dogs, potentially calling into question the hypothesis of an East Asian origin for dog domestication...|$|R

Chicago, Prickly Paradigm Press.) extends her {{concept of the}} cyborg to explore how the figure of ¿companion species¿ can rethink the models of reality that traditionally underpin cultural research. This paper investigates the kind of consumption worlds and consumption relations the ontology of companion species suggests and what it offers in terms of understanding consumption in a post-human (and post-canine) consumer-behavior landscape. Following this, it proposes the concept of ¿companion-species consumption¿ (CSC) as a new ontology to extend interpretive research on consumers and their pets (Hirschman, E. C., (1994). Consumers and their animal companions. J Consum Res, 20 (3), 616 ¿ 632.; Holbrook, M. B., Stephens, D. L., Day, E., Holbrook, S. M. and Strazar, G., (2001).

40|$|Much {{of what is}} {{understood}} about canine coat color genetics focuses on single gene inheritance. However, within the traditional color patterns, there is noticeable variation, suggesting modification of known coat color alleles. Alleles of the Agouti Signaling Protein (ASIP) gene control the temporal and spatial expression of red-based phaeomelanin and black-based eumelanin pigments. While up to six ASIP alleles have been predicted by previous studies, only two alleles, ay fawn and a recessive black, {{have been identified as}} polymorphisms within ASIP. Through sequence analysis, a SINE insertion in intron 1 of ASIP was detected that segregates with the black-and-tan, saddle tan and recessive black phenotypes. Together with the diagnostic tests for the ay and a alleles, detection of the SINE allows for complete genotyping of the four common ASIP alleles: ay, aw, at, a. Salukis and <b>Afghan</b> <b>Hounds</b> exhibit a phenotype known as grizzle or domino. This phenotype is similar to the black-and-tan phenotype, also present in both breeds, though the phaeomelanin points extend further up the limbs, onto the ventral surface, and form a widow’s peak on the face. Sequencing of the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC 1 R) gene identified a G 78 V polymorphism that segregates with the grizzle/domino phenotype. Further genotype analysis showed that expression of the grizzle/domino pattern requires a genotype interaction involving ASIP, MC 1 R, and Canine Beta-Defensin 103 (DEFB 103). The saddle tan phenotype is present in scent hounds, terriers, and herding breeds, and is characterized by phaeomelanin pigment on the limbs, often extending to the midline of the back, and encompassing the entire head. Genome wide association study analysis, fine mapping, and sequence analysis identified a 16 bp tandem duplication in intron 5 of the hnRNP-Associated with Lethal Yellow (RALY) gene that segregates with the black-and-tan phenotype, versus saddle tan, in Basset Hounds and Pembroke Welsh Corgis. In breeds that never have the saddle tan phenotype, but frequently have the black-and-tan phenotype, the RALY duplication does not segregate with black-and-tan. This, together with further genotype analysis, suggests a gene interaction of ASIP, MC 1 R, DEFB 103, RALY, and an additional modifier gene is required for expression of saddle tan or black-and-tan...|$|R
