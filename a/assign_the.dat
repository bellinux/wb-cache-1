5|$|With {{the plans}} purchased, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began the {{intricate}} political negotiations to <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> six boats—to be designated U-27 to U-32—between Austrian and Hungarian firms. Of the initial order of six boats, two were {{allocated to the}} Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) operating out of the Pola Navy Yard, and the balance to the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius in Fiume. The Navy ordered the first six boats of the class on 12 October 1915.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, {{a credit}} dispute between {{universal}} primer technology and DNA barcoding came to light. Verma {{has argued that}} DNA barcoding, a technique independently described by zoologist Paul D N Hebert in 2003, {{is essentially the same}} as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> identity of an unknown biological sample to a particular species. Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should be fairly credited. However, Hebert argued that he was not aware of UPT because its patents were not visible to the broader scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filing in 2001 to grant in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Ralambo's many {{enduring}} {{and significant}} {{political and cultural}} achievements of his reign have earned him a heroic and near mythical status among the greatest ancient sovereigns of Merina history. Ralambo {{was the first to}} <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> name of Imerina ("Land of the Merina people") to the central highland territories where he ruled. He moved his capital from Alasora to Ambohidrabiby, location of the former capital of his maternal grandfather King Rabiby. The first sub-divisions of the andriana noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks. He introduced the traditions of circumcision and family intermarriage (such as between parent and step-child, or between half-siblings) among Merina nobles, these practices having already existed among certain other Malagasy ethnic groups. The practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is also believed to have originated with this king.|$|E

30|$|It also {{suggests}} {{the construction of}} questionnaires with statements regarding the ease of use and {{the utility of the}} technology under analysis. For each statement, the respondent should choose one of the following options, according to his/her opinion about it: “totally disagree,” “strongly disagree,” “partially disagree,” “neutral,” “partially agree,” “strongly agree,” and “totally agree.” In this context, seven metrics were proposed: (M 1) percentage of participants that <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “totally disagree” option, (M 2) percentage of participants that <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “strongly disagree” option, (M 3) percentage of participants that <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “partially disagree” option, (M 4) percentage of participants that <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “neutral” option, (M 5) percentage of participants that <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “partially agree” option, (M 6) percentage of participants that <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “strongly agree” option, and (M 7) percentage of participants that <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “totally agree” option. The statements of the questionnaires proposed in this work are presented in Tables  10 and 11, along with the results of this quasi-experimental study.|$|R

5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the speed limit in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 {{miles an hour and}} there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles an hour in the summer of 2004.|$|E
5|$|To {{successfully}} complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills {{and how many}} uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings. There are eight skills that can be assigned: 'Climbers' climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. 'Floaters' use a parachute to fall safely from heights. 'Bombers' explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. 'Blockers' stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. 'Builders' build a stairway of 12 steps. 'Bashers', 'Miners' and 'Diggers' dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.|$|E
5|$|Centaur was {{allocated}} the United Kingdom Official Number 147275 and the Code Letters KHHC. Her {{port of registry}} was Liverpool. When Centaur entered {{service at}} the end of 1924, the Fremantle–Java– Singapore trade route was being serviced by two other Blue Funnel Line vessels; Gorgon (which remained in service until 1928) and Charon (which Centaur was replacing). Centaurs route ran from Fremantle up the Western Australian coast calling at Geraldton, Carnarvon, Onslow, Point Samson, Port Hedland, Broome, and Derby then to the Bali Strait, Surabaya, Semarang, Batavia, and Singapore. Centaur operated as a cross between a tramp steamer and a freight liner; she travelled a set route, but stops at ports along the route varied between journeys. From 1928 until sometime in the 1930s, Centaur remained alone on her route, but the increase in trade along this route prompted Blue Funnel Line to reassign Gorgon and <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> new Charon to work alongside Centaur.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} town was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During World War I the region was {{captured}} by the German Empire, which intended to incorporate the area into its province of East Prussia. After the German defeat, the victorious Entente was willing to <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> territory to either the newly independent Poland or Lithuania. The future of the region was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919. The Germans, whose former Ober-Ost administration was preparing to evacuate, initially supported leaving the area to a Polish administration. However, as Poland was becoming an ally of France, German support gradually shifted towards Lithuania. In July 1919, when the German troops began their slow retreat from the area, they delegated the administration to local Lithuanian authorities. Lithuanian officers and troops, who first arrived in the region in May, began to organize military units in the pre-war Sejny county.|$|E
5|$|Pong was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Atari. After producing Computer Space, Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game. Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games. To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly {{meant to be a}} warm-up exercise. Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping. In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college. However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game. In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game. Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> project to Alcorn.|$|E
5|$|The modern Olympic Games {{were first}} held in Athens in 1896, and {{travelled}} to Paris {{four years later}} {{as part of the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle world's fair. The second Games featured a greatly expanded range of events from the first, up from 43 to 95. Among the events added in 1900 was the tug of war. Two tug of war teams were entered for the Paris tournament; Racing Club de France represented the host nation, along with a team from the United States which was composed of six athletes that were taking part in various other events during the Games. The American team withdrew from the competition, as they discovered that the tug of war was scheduled {{at the same time as}} the hammer throw which three of their team were competing in. A Scandinavian team was accepted as a late-entry by the organisers, comprising a mix of Swedish and Danish athletes competing at the Games. Various reports <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> credit for the formation and entry of this team to different sources; a Danish account claimed that it was one of the Danish pullers, Eugen Schmidt who was responsible, while a Swedish record attributed it to their representative at the Games, Lieutenant Bergh.|$|E
