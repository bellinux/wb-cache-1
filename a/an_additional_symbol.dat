30|$|While bit-loading {{algorithms}} over wireless {{systems have}} been extensively studied, {{the development of a}} protocol which implements bit-loading-based rate adaptation over wireless systems has not been highlighted. The design of such a protocol is not a trivial problem, due to the overhead associated with the feedback information. In this paper, a novel protocol is proposed to provide an efficient way to implement subcarrier-wise rate adaptation in OFDM-based wireless systems. When receiving a Ready-To-Send (RTS) packet, the receiver determines the number of bits to be allocated on each subcarrier through channel estimation. This decision is delivered to the sender using <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> OFDM <b>symbol</b> in the Clear-To-Send (CTS) packet. That is, bit-allocation over subcarriers is achieved using only one <b>additional</b> OFDM <b>symbol.</b> The protocol enhances the channel efficiency in spite of the overhead of one <b>additional</b> OFDM <b>symbol.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} capacity achieving reliable information transfer over time varying communication channels. We show that differential detection, instead of channel estimation, can be used, in combination with convectional maximum-likelihood (ML) error detection, for the capacity achieving reliable communications over flat-fading phase time varying communication channels. We show that at high SNR values, symbol-by-symbol non-coherent differential detection can be used. At low SNR values, the so-called multiple symbol differential detection technique is used to further improve {{the performance of the}} system. We demonstrate that, practically, the channel information capacity can be approached with observation times only on the order of <b>a</b> few <b>additional</b> <b>symbol</b> intervals. Either for symbol by-symbol or multiple-symbol differential detection, the channel phase needs to be assumed constant throughout only one symbol interval...|$|R

5000|$|From the 19th century {{there were}} {{conscious}} attempts {{to foster a}} federal [...] "Pan-Swiss" [...] national identity that would replace or alleviate the cantonal patriotisms. Among the traditions enlisted to this end were federal sharpshooting competitions or tirs, because they {{were one of the}} few recognized symbols of pan-Swiss identity prior {{to the creation of the}} 1815 Confederation and because they traditionally involved men from all levels of society, including the peasants, who in Romantic nationalism had become ideologically synonymous with liberty and nationhood. <b>An</b> <b>additional</b> <b>symbol</b> of federal national identity at the federal level was introduced with the Swiss national holiday in 1889. The bonfires associated with the national holiday have become so customary since then that they have displaced the Funken traditions of greater antiquity. Identification with the national symbolism relating to the Old Swiss Confederacy was especially difficult for the cantons which had been joined to the Helvetic Republic in 1798 without any prior history of participation in the Swiss Confederacy, and which were given the status of Swiss cantons only after the end of the Napoleonic era. These specifically include Grisons, Valais, Ticino, Vaud and Geneva. St. Gallen is a special case in a different sense, being a conglomerate of various historical regions created in 1803; in this case, patriotism may attach itself even to sub-cantonal entities, such as the Toggenburg. Similarly, due to the historical imperialism of the canton of Berne, there is considerable irredentism within the Bernese lands, most visibly in the Bernese Jura but to a lesser extent also in parts of the Bernese Oberland such as Hasli.|$|E

A ∆ 0 (α) -formula is a bounded formula in the language of Peano Arith-metic with <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> predicate <b>symbol</b> α. For such a formula ϕ, the well-known Paris-Wilkie translation produces a sequence of propositional formulas, where the nth formula expresses that ϕ holds of the integers up to n. For a proof system P, the set UP is defined as the set of those ∆ 0 (α) -formulas ϕ whose Paris-Wilkie-translations have polynomial size proofs in P. If P is polynomially bounded, then UP coincides with the set T of ∆ 0 (α) -formulas that are true in the integers, and similarly, if P polynomially simulates Q, then UQ ⊆ UP, but the converses of these statements do not necessarily hold.
