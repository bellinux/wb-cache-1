It further criticised the EU as taking a [...] "highly centralised political and economic power-bloc" [...] whose decision making is made in what they termed [...] "completely undemocratic institutions"; and that EU bureaucrats work against the interest of small farmers and restructure industry so that the EU centre can prosper <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>expense.</b> Amongst all these issues it said that Ireland's neutrality is under threat.|$|E

50|$|Painter, {{sculptor}} and engraver, the Quebec City's artist explores several {{technical means}} and approaches them not separately {{like so many}} individuated vehicles of expression, but rather like a gathering of manners, a single whole body baring the advantage of maximizing a frenzied expression, and all-consuming passion. Jean Gaudreau morphs into an acrobat <b>at</b> <b>our</b> own <b>expenses</b> to create flaming visual orgies. The artist borrows his iconography from the circus's syntax, the grammatical codes of dance and the plastic arts' vocabulary.|$|R

His tales were all literally true, and Uncle Jesse had the gift of the born story-teller, whereby [...] "unhappy, far-off things" [...] can be brought vividly before the hearer and made to live again in all their pristine poignancy.|$|R

"You have no {{business}} to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes <b>at</b> <b>our</b> mama's <b>expense.</b> Now, I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years.

It is a collection of one liners, comments and brief stories about lots of entrepreneurs that have been there and done it - some successfully and some not so well.

60|$|And let us {{remember}} this, that whenever we fancy {{ourselves to be}} strong and powerful, and think to aggrandize ourselves <b>at</b> <b>our</b> neighbour's <b>expense,</b> and to crush those who are weaker than ourselves, then we are forgetting the lesson of Good Friday; that whenever we fancy that the way to be wise is, to use our wit and our knowledge for our own glory, and by them to manage our fellow-men, and make them admire us and bow down to us, then we forget the lesson of Good Friday. For whosoever gives himself up to selfish ambition, or to selfish cunning, charges Christ upon his cross with weakness and with foolishness, and denies the Lord who bought him with his blood.|$|R
6000|$|He only {{laughed and}} shrugged his shoulders; {{but he was}} as good to our poor as it is {{possible}} to be as we live here in France, where we are often absolutely complelled to live <b>at</b> court, and <b>our</b> <b>expenses</b> there force us to press heavily on our already hard-driven peasants.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the Communists in Hollywood is not the {{production}} of political movies openly advocating Communism.

6000|$|As we sat, in the drizzly evening, {{over our}} {{comfortable}} tea table, C---- ventured to intimate pretty decidedly {{that he considered}} the whole thing a bore; whereat I thought I saw a sly twinkle around the eyes and mouth of our most Christian and patient friend, Joseph Sturge. Mr. S. laughingly {{told him that he}} thought it the greatest exercise of Christian tolerance, that he should have trailed round in the mud with us all day in our sightseeing, bearing with our unreasonable raptures. He smiled, and said, quietly, [...] "I must confess that I was a little pleased that our friend Harriet was so zealous to see Shakspeare's house, when it wasn't his house, and so earnest to get sprigs from his mulberry, when it wasn't his mulberry."

6000|$|We enjoyed such {{intimacy}} with Mr. Hoskins {{that he never}} failed to greet us with a kind nod; and John the waiter made room for us near the President of the convivial meeting.

60|$|I {{have been}} told since that he was noted for his {{strength}} and his bravery, and I could answer for it {{that he had the}} grip of a bear, for I had felt it when he tore me from my saddle. He was a wit, too, in his way, and made continual remarks in Russian <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>expense</b> which set all his Dragoons and Cossacks laughing.

40|$|It is illegitimate to {{read any}} {{ontology}} about "race" off of biological theory or data. Indeed, the technical meaning of "genetic variation" is fluid, {{and there is}} no single theoretical agreed-upon criterion for defining and distinguishing populations (or groups or clusters) given a particular set of genetic variation data. Thus, by analyzing three formal senses of "genetic variation"—diversity, differentiation, and heterozygosity—we argue that the use of biological theory for making epistemic claims about "race" can only seem plausible when it relies on the user’s own assumptions about race; the move from biological measures to claims about “race” inevitably amounts to a pernicious reification. We also excavate assumptions {{in the history of the}} technical discourse over the concept of "race" (e. g., Livingstone's and Dobzhansky's 1962 exchange, Edwards' 2003 response to Lewontin 1972, as well as contemporary discussions of cladistic "race", and "races" as clusters). We show that claims about the existence (or non-existence) of "race" are underdetermined by biological facts, methods, and theories. Biological theory does not force the concept of "race" upon us; our social discourse, social ontology, and social expectations do. We become prisoners of <b>our</b> abstractions <b>at</b> <b>our</b> own hands, and <b>at</b> <b>our</b> own <b>expense...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a draft, [...] "Proposed Articles of Confederation", {{presented}} to the Continental Congress on May 10, 1775, Benjamin Franklin called for a [...] "perpetual Alliance" [...] with the Indians for the nation about to take birth, especially with the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy: Article XI. A perpetual Alliance offensive and defensive, is to be entered into as soon as may be with the Six Nations; their Limits to be ascertained and secured to them; their Land not to be encroached on, nor any private or Colony Purchases made of them hereafter to be held good; nor any Contract for Lands to be made but between the Great Council of the Indians at Onondaga and the General Congress.

I suppose somebody told him {{at the top of}} the hill that there was nothing to arbitrate, and to get out and go about his business, and that was the reason he marched down after he had marched up with all that ceremony. What amuses me is to find that in an affair of this kind the roads have rights and the strikers have rights, but the public has no rights at all. The roads and the strikers are allowed to fight out a private war in our midst as thoroughly and precisely a private war as any we despise the Middle Ages for having tolerated--as any street war in Florence or Verona--and to fight it out <b>at</b> <b>our</b> pains and <b>expense,</b> and we stand by like sheep and wait till they get tired.

From a few scattered announcements on fence boards, they had crowded themselves into more prominent places until the barns and sheds and the very rocks were daubed with glaring letters asking us to buy the medicines, soaps, tobaccos, and other wares the manufacturers were anxious to sell. Every country road became an advertising avenue. Scarcely a country house was free from signs of some sort. Yet the people tamely submitted to this imposition because they knew no way to avoid it. When Mr. Forbes began his campaign to restore the homesteads to their former beauty and dignity, a cry was raised against him. But this was because the farmers did not understand how much this reform meant to them. So we gave them an object lesson. We painted out all the signs in this section <b>at</b> <b>our</b> own <b>expense,</b> that you might see how much more beautiful your homes are without them. We believe that none of you will ever care to allow advertising signs on your property again, and that the quiet refinement {{of this part of}} the country will induce many other places to follow our example, until advertisers are forced to confine themselves to newspapers, magazines and circulars, their only legitimate channels. This much Mr. Forbes has already done for you, and he will now tell you what else, if he is elected, he proposes to do." ...|$|R
