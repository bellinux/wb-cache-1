25|$|The {{following}} day, Max {{writes a}} letter to Naomi, explaining his relationship with and feelings for Karen. Karen implores him to rethink the revelation, specifically the unreality of the arrangement ("You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> dream. Go back to her".) She tears up the letter, and they agree that while Naomi must {{be made aware of}} the affair, it is best both to write her and tell her in person. Karen's rendezvous with Max is eventually discovered by Mrs. Michaelis, and while Karen tries to explain the relationship, Mrs. Michaelis cannot understand.|$|E
25|$|The biggest bone of {{contention}} between {{the advocates of}} the 'modern' orthographies and the 'traditionalist' orthographies {{is the use of}} w and y to show the semi-vowels. In general native speakers in literacy classes seem to find y and w very difficult to learn, and that u <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> 'logical' letters to use. Syllabification of words by untrained speakers suggests that u and i are really the underlying sounds. Thus, a word like dhaudhai 'mainland, continent' syllabifies as dha-u-dha-i, not dhau-dhai. In songs, the glide-u/i can also be given full syllable status. Historical considerations also point to the semi-vowels often being vocalic rather than consonantal. Thus, lagau, the genitive of laag 'place' is in underlying form +ngu>; the full form of the genitive ending -ngu is only retained where the nominal has a monosyllabic stem (see the section on Nominal Morphology). Similarly, verbal nouns end in -i, e.g. lumai, stem luuma- 'search, look for, seek, hunt'. The mid-19th century to early 20th century records of Kauaraigau Ya show that the verbal noun ending was previously -ri (thus lumari), where the -r- was presumably the rhotic glide rather than the rhotic tap/trill.|$|E
