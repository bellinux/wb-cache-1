25|$|Enzyme {{promiscuity}} is {{the ability}} of an enzyme to catalyse a fortuitous side reaction in addition to its main reaction. Although enzymes are remarkably specific catalysts, they can often perform side reactions in addition to their main, native catalytic activity. These promiscuous activities are usually slow relative to the main activity and are under neutral selection. Despite ordinarily being physiologically irrelevant, under new selective pressures these activities may confer a fitness benefit therefore prompting the evolution of the formerly promiscuous activity to become the new main activity. An example of this is the <b>atrazine</b> chlorohydrolase (atzA encoded) from Pseudomonas sp. ADP which evolved from melamine deaminase (triA encoded), which has very small promiscuous activity towards <b>atrazine,</b> a man-made chemical.|$|E
25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., <b>atrazine),</b> ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|E

[...] Some alter the central nervous system; others like <b>atrazine</b> cause a disruption in the production and secretion of hormones. Experimental studies have also shown that exposure to commonly used herbicides such as glyphosate (Tradename Roundup) or insecticides such as malathion or carbaryl greatly increase mortality of tadpoles. Additional {{studies have indicated that}} terrestrial adult stages of amphibians are also susceptible to non-active ingredients in Roundup, particularly POEA, which is a surfactant. [...] <b>Atrazine</b> has been shown to cause male tadpoles of African clawed frogs to become hermaphroditic with development of both male and female organs. Such feminization has been reported {{in many parts of the}} world. In a study conducted in a laboratory at Uppsala University in Sweden, more than 50% of frogs exposed to levels of estrogen-like pollutants existing in natural bodies of water in Europe and the United States became females. Tadpoles exposed even to the weakest concentration of estrogen were twice as likely to become females while almost all of the control group given the heaviest dose became female.|$|E

In 2002 FotSJR developed the St. Joseph River Watershed Management Plan, with grant support from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The river delivers significant pollutants to Lake Michigan - including sewage overflows from riverside communities, sediments and toxic substances such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). When the plan was developed, the river carried the greatest portion of <b>atrazine</b> into Lake Michigan.

50|$|Rates of {{biodegradation}} {{are affected}} by atrazine's low solubility, thus surfactants may increase the degradation rate. Though the two alkyl moieties readily support growth of certain microorganisms, the <b>atrazine</b> ring is a poor energy source due to the oxidized state of ring carbon. In fact, the most common pathway for <b>atrazine</b> degradation involves the intermediate, cyanuric acid, in which carbon is fully oxidized, thus the ring is primarily a nitrogen source for aerobic microorganisms. <b>Atrazine</b> may be catabolized as a carbon and nitrogen source in reducing environments, and some aerobic <b>atrazine</b> degraders {{have been shown to}} use the compound for growth under anoxia in the presence of nitrate as an electron acceptor, a process referred to as a denitrification. When <b>atrazine</b> is used as a nitrogen source for bacterial growth, degradation may be regulated by the presence of alternative sources of nitrogen. In pure cultures of atrazine-degrading bacteria, as well as active soil communitites, <b>atrazine</b> ring nitrogen, but not carbon are assimilated into microbial biomass. Low concentrations of glucose can decrease the bioavailability, whereas higher concentrations promote the catabolism of <b>atrazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The EPA {{is aware}} that a common {{herbicide}} called <b>Atrazine</b> causes abdominal wall defects {{as well as other}} birth defects and cancer. <b>Atrazine</b> has been banned in the EU since 2004, yet is still commonly used in the US despite the evidence of harm. <b>Atrazine</b> affects the drinking water supply, most predominantly in the midwest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atrazine</b> Chlorohydrolase (AtzA) is {{an enzyme}} (E.C.3.8.1.8), which catalyzes the {{conversion}} of <b>atrazine</b> to hydroxyatrazine. Bacterial degradation determines the environmental impact and efficacy of an herbicide or pesticide. Initially, most pesticides are highly effective and show minimal bacterial degradation; however, bacteria can rapidly evolve and gain the ability to metabolize potential nutrients in the environment. Despite a remarkable structural similarity, degradation of <b>atrazine</b> by bacteria capable of melamine degradation was rare; however, since its introduction as a pesticide in the United States, bacteria capable of <b>atrazine</b> degradation have evolved. Currently, Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP {{seems to be the}} optimal bacterial strain for <b>atrazine</b> degradations, which appears to be the sole nitrogen source for the bacteria.|$|E

5000|$|The {{triazine}} {{family of}} herbicides, which includes <b>atrazine,</b> {{were introduced in}} the 1950s; they have the current {{distinction of being the}} herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination. <b>Atrazine</b> does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above neutral pH. Under alkaline soil conditions, <b>atrazine</b> may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination. <b>Atrazine</b> is thus said to have [...] "carryover", a generally undesirable property for herbicides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atrazine</b> {{contamination}} of surface water (lakes, rivers, and streams) has been {{monitored by the}} EPA and has consistently exceeded levels of concern in two Missouri watersheds and one in Nebraska. As of 2001, <b>Atrazine</b> was the most commonly detected pesticide in US drinking water. Monitoring of <b>atrazine</b> levels in community water systems in 31 high-use states found that levels exceeded levels of concern for infant exposure during {{at least one year}} between 1993 and 2001 in 34 of 3670 community water systems using surface water, and in none of 14,500 community water systems using groundwater. Surface water monitoring data from 20 high <b>atrazine</b> use watersheds found peak <b>atrazine</b> levels up to 147 parts per billion, with daily averages in all cases below 10 parts per billion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atrazine</b> {{is widely}} used as an {{herbicide}} to control broad-leaf weed species that grow in crops such as corn, sugarcane, hay and winter wheat. <b>Atrazine</b> is also applied to Christmas trees, residential lawns, golf courses, and other recreational areas. <b>Atrazine</b> is the second largest selling pesticide {{in the world and}} estimated to be the most heavily used herbicide in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|A September 2003 {{review by}} the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) stated that <b>atrazine</b> is [...] "currently under review for {{pesticide}} re-registration by the EPA because of concerns that <b>atrazine</b> may cause cancer", but not enough information was available to [...] "definitely state whether it causes cancer in humans." [...] According to the ATSDR, {{one of the primary}} ways that <b>atrazine</b> can affect a person's health is [...] "by altering the way that the reproductive system works. Studies of couples living on farms that use <b>atrazine</b> for weed control found an increase in the risk of preterm delivery, but these studies are difficult to interpret because most of the farmers were men who may have been exposed to several types of pesticides. Little information is available regarding the risks to children, however [...] "maternal exposure to <b>atrazine</b> in drinking water has been associated with low fetal weight and heart, urinary, and limb defects in humans". Incidence of a birth defect known as gastroschisis appears to be higher in areas where surface water <b>atrazine</b> levels are elevated especially when conception occurs in the spring, the time when <b>atrazine</b> is commonly applied.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atrazine,</b> a {{triazine}} herbicide, {{is used in}} {{corn and}} sorghum for control of broadleaf weeds and grasses. Still used because of its low cost and because it works well on {{a broad spectrum of}} weeds common in the US corn belt, <b>atrazine</b> is commonly used with other herbicides to reduce the overall rate of <b>atrazine</b> and to lower the potential for groundwater contamination; it is a photosystem II inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atrazine</b> is an {{herbicide}} of the triazine class. <b>Atrazine</b> is used {{to prevent}} pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.|$|E
