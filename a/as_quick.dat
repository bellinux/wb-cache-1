5|$|While a teenager, Kane {{initially}} {{struggled in}} Tottenham's academy, as partially {{due to his}} date of birth in July, he was not as physically developed as other players, nor was he <b>as</b> <b>quick.</b> However, he gained the respect of coaches with his technique and desire for self-improvement.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{was picked}} for Tasmania in two matches against the touring South Africans in January 1932. He failed {{to perform in}} the first match in Launceston, taking 1/68 and 2/45 and scoring 17 and 9. However, Nash had a lively bowling {{performance}} in the Hobart match, making the ball come off the wicket at a great pace and gaining match figures of 9/137, including two wickets in consecutive balls and breaking batsman Eric Dalton's jaw with a vicious bouncer on the hat-trick ball. South African captain Jock Cameron praised Nash for his performance as his bowling in the match {{was thought to be}} <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> and dangerous as any bowler in the world.|$|E

5|$|Version 2002 was {{announced}} August 28, 2001. The Family Edition was dropped, so parental controls and information filtering are bundled with this release. The installation was noted <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> and simple by both PC Magazine and CNET. An installation requires a reboot, and afterwards the Security Assistant guides users through a questionnaire to best configure the settings. A problem CNET encountered when upgrading from the prior release was {{the loss of}} customized settings. PC Magazine found the default settings, aimed at avoiding frequent notifications, were somewhat permissive. Windows 95 support was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Infantry Brigade {{took over}} {{the vanguard of the}} advance on 2 September, tasked with {{clearing}} the Germans from their positions overlooking Haplincourt. This they did after overcoming numerous machine gun nests, plus the guns of two disabled tanks being used as outposts. Over 350 prisoners of war were taken, along with 80 machine guns plus a field gun. Their advance was not <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> as that of the 42nd Division, making a corresponding move forward, which had made good progress and the British, until the New Zealanders caught up, had to lay down heavy suppressing fire on both flanks. The New Zealand Division now halted for a few days as pressure was being placed on the German lines elsewhere and the emphasis for IV Corps was now to pursue the enemy to the Hindenburg Line.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Deus Ex was {{revealed}} by Eidos in 2001 through job listings advertising for designers {{to work on}} the game. Later that month at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Eidos confirmed that both the second Deus Ex and the next Thief game would be coming to consoles before arriving on PC; the explanation was that taking the restrictions of console hardware into account would make later ports to PC more effective. Eidos officially announced the game E3 2002; the platforms listed were PC, Xbox and PS2. It was later revealed that Ion Storm were struggling to work out how to port the game to PS2 given the extensive hardware differences between the three platforms, and were reluctant to do so due to these issues. Following the game's release, it was clarified that no PS2 version would be developed. As part of the promotion, the soundtrack was made available for download through the game's website. A demo was released in November 2003. The game was released in North America on December 2, 2003. Following the North American release, Ion Storm released a patch to fix issues with the graphics and additional gameplay elements such <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> saves. The game released in Europe on March 5, 2004. The Xbox version was also released in Japan. First announced in March 2004, the game was released on June 17.|$|E

25|$|The sudden {{burst of}} {{violence}} {{associated with the}} Battle of Ambos Nogales (and the almost nearly <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> resolution of that conflict by Cabell and Calles), coupled with the relatively low casualties of the confrontation (when compared to the carnage associated with the Western Front), ensured that this battle would remain obscure. No monument or other physical historic memorial commemorates this battle on the US side.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to a hit-up is for the player in the acting-halfback position to run the ball himself, without passing. This is often performed by quicker players as {{they are able to}} round the markers and make ground for their side. Some teams use repeated dummy-half scoots with the intention of playing the ball quickly and catching defenders before they are able to properly position themselves. This is known <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> ball or 'getting a roll on'.|$|E
25|$|Allan Border added 35, and Dean Jones made 27, but the {{highlight}} of the second day {{came in the form of}} Steve Waugh who continued his imperious form from the first test, driving square of the wicket masterfully. Although he was not <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> scoring in the first test, he moved onto 35 not out by the close, with Merv Hughes once again by his side not out on 2. Australia had ground out runs throughout a slow second day to end on 276 for 6, still ten runs behind England's first innings score.|$|E

According to memoirs of nuclear {{strategist}} and theorist Munir Ahmad Khan, the hectic discussion took place every day between ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs, in an amid fears that India might attack Pakistan who was en route to become subsequent nuclear power. Since 1981, the commanders of the Pakistan's unified armed forces were given the standing orders to mobilize their forces at once, from all directions, <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> as it can to divert such attacks.|$|E

Alistair Campbell and Grant Flower had also faced Waqar Younis at his peak, and Wasim Akram and the Pakistani pace battery before this. They had in fact played a full 3-Test series in January 1995, when they had won their first Test match, thrashing Pakistan by an innings and 64 runs and scoring 544/4 declared in their only innings.

Cars carrying dozens of officers from both the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s Department rushed to the area.

25|$|Polybius also blamed Demetrius' {{influence}} for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.|$|E
25|$|Mansell {{took over}} the car Senna {{was brought in to}} drive {{toward the end of the}} 1994 campaign. Mansell was paid {{approximately}} £900,000 per race, compared to his teammate Hill being paid £300,000 for the entire season. Mansell's return was helped by Bernie Ecclestone helping unravel his contracts in the United States. It was important for F1 to have a world champion driving that season and with worldwide TV viewing figures starting to decline, they needed Mansell. The 40-year-old was not <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> as Damon Hill in race trim but signs that his speeds were coming back were evident in Japan during a fantastic battle with the Ferrari of Jean Alesi. Mansell took his final Grand Prix victory in Adelaide, the last race of the season, having out-qualified the two title contenders at the time, Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher, in the process (helped out by the second qualifying session being held on a wet track, with the times from the first session making up the grid). The plan initially was for Mansell to protect Hill from Schumacher, but both drivers passed him at the start and eventually collided (causing the retirement of both), handing Schumacher his first world title.|$|E
