50|$|In August 2014, a {{swarm of}} around 1,600 {{earthquakes}} in 48-hours, with magnitudes up to 4.5MW, was followed on 23 August by the USGS Aviation Color Codes being raised from orange to red, indicating an eruption in progress. The following day, the <b>aviation</b> <b>risk</b> was lowered from red to orange and the statement {{that there was an}} eruption in progress was retracted. However, later aerial observations of glacial depressions southeast of the volcano suggested that the now-retracted report of an eruption had been correct and that a short eruption did occur under the ice, but the lack of further melting indicated that this eruption had now ceased. Then, a new fissure eruption breached the surface between Bárðarbunga and Askja, in the Holuhraun lava field, {{in the early hours of}} 29 August. This was followed by a second fissure eruption in the Holuhraun area, along the same volcanic fissure, which started shortly after 4 am on 31 August.|$|E
40|$|Risk {{management}} {{is considered to}} be an application of general concepts in scientific management of a particular problem of exposure to risk of loss. It is concerned with identifying objectives, analysing the data regarding the nature of the problem, evaluating the pure risks deriving from the nature of the business and choosing or finding the most suitable method or methods of handling these risks; aiming to control them and their effects as well as minimizing the cost. The field of aviation has grown very quickly and developed faster {{in the last few years}} to reach the present level of operation and technology by introducing more advanced and higher capacity airliners. Therefore, <b>aviation</b> <b>risks</b> and their financial impact exhibit a number of distinguishing characteristics that raise problems for traditional risk management and insurance technique in dealing with such risks. The study reviews, analyses and classifies <b>aviation</b> <b>risks</b> and their characteristics as well as the major hazards involved in aircraft and their operation. The research undertakes to review the international conventions and agreements affecting air transportation and the limits of liabilities affecting those who operate airlines internationally in respect of death, injury or damage caused to passengers, baggage, cargo and third parties as well as safety and security of aircraft in the air and on the ground. It also studies and analyses the international jet airliner fleet, their accidents and their causes to provide a basis of choosing suitable risk levels in managing these risks...|$|R

40|$|Aerial fire {{fighting}} is a high-risk, high-cost aviation environment. Normal <b>aviation</b> <b>risks</b> are magnified, sometimes significantly, {{by a number}} of factors. Over the years a number of accidents (mid-air collisions and controlled flight into terrain), near mid-air collisions, and other serious incidents involving {{fire fighting}} aircraft have occurred. The causes of these accidents or incidents have been primarily attributed to loss of situational awareness in the relatively unstructured aerial environment surrounding wildland fires. In an effort to improve safety and efficiency researchers at NASA Ames Research Center are working with aerial fire fighters to develop a standard phraseology, air space structure, and a navigatiodsituation display.

50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 2005 {{with the purpose of}} {{operating}} turboprop commuter aircraft. The initial fleet consisted of 1 Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft and 3 Beechcraft 1900C aircraft. CemAir has since evolved into a specialised aircraft leasing company offering turboprop and jet aircraft to a variety of operators throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Indian Ocean islands as well as a significant operator of scheduled regional services within South Africa. The company is a South African Part 121 (large aircraft operator) and Part 135 (small aircraft operator) company, holding South African Civil Aviation Authority issued AOCs (Air Operator Certificates) in both of these categories. The Air Service Licensing Council has issued the company with domestic and international licenses, for both scheduled and non-scheduled services. In addition, CemAir holds approval from the SACAA for a Part 145 AMO (Approved Maintenance Organisation), which allows it to operate its own maintenance department. The management structure conforms to the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) model and has six full-time post holders for complete oversight of flight operations and maintenance. The duties and responsibilities of each position are documented with frequent internal and external audits to ensure compliance.The organisation runs an ICAO based Safety Management System (SMS) conforming to the requirements of ICAO Safety Management Standards & Recommended Practises (SARPs) and ICAO Doc 9859.The company was previously a member of the Flight Safety Foundation and completed three successive BARS audits. BARS (Basic <b>Aviation</b> <b>Risk</b> Standard) is a move towards audit standardization using a risk-based model based on best practice aviation safety principles and tailored {{to the needs of the}} resource sector, mainly the mining industry. Two additional resource based audits have been successfully concluded by Hart Aviation to ensure that CemAir's operating and maintenance standards are acceptable to companies in the oil, gas and petroleum industry.

40|$|Understanding {{movements}} of hazardous wildlife species at and near airports {{is critical to}} formulating effective management strategies for reducing <b>aviation</b> <b>risk.</b> Animal movements vary daily, seasonally, and annually and are based on broad biological and ecological concepts, including foraging, reproduction, habitat characteristics, dispersal, and migration. As an energy conservation strategy, most animals minimize their movements to meet life requisites, which in turn presumably improves fitness. Animal movements in relation to airports can be direct; for example, Canada geese (Branta canadensis) flying onto an airfield because grass height and composition are suitable for loafing sites and as food. Animal movements in and around airports can also be indirect; for example, airports near large rivers may experience increased numbers of birds flying overhead during spring and autumn migrations, as rivers often facilitate bird navigation...|$|E

40|$|The {{projected}} {{impact of}} compositional verification {{research conducted by}} the National Aeronautic and Space Administration System-Wide Safety and Assurance Technologies on <b>aviation</b> safety <b>risk</b> was assessed. Software and compositional verification was described. Traditional verification techniques have two major problems: testing at the prototype stage where error discovery can be quite costly and the inability to test for all potential interactions leaving some errors undetected until used by the end user. Increasingly complex and nondeterministic aviation systems are becoming too large for these tools to check and verify. Compositional verification is a "divide and conquer" solution to addressing increasingly larger and more complex systems. A review of compositional verification research being conducted by academia, industry, and Government agencies is provided. Forty-four <b>aviation</b> safety <b>risks</b> in the Biennial NextGen Safety Issues Survey were identified that could be impacted by compositional verification and grouped into five categories: automation design; system complexity; software, flight control, or equipment failure or malfunction; new technology or operations; and verification and validation. One capability, 1 research action, 5 operational improvements, and 13 enablers within the Federal Aviation Administration Joint Planning and Development Office Integrated Work Plan that could be addressed by compositional verification were identified...|$|R

In a complex domain, such as the National Airspace System (NAS), {{it is essential that}} knowledge elicitation (KE) sessions with domain experts be performed to facilitate the making of plausible inferences about the possible impacts of future technologies and procedures. This study discusses lessons learned throughout the multiple KE sessions held with domain experts to construct probabilistic safety risk models for a Loss of Control Accident Framework (LOCAF), FLightdeck Automation Problems (FLAP), and Runway Incursion (RI) mishap scenarios. The intent of these safety risk models is to support a portfolio analysis of NASA's Aviation Safety Program (AvSP). These models use the flexible, probabilistic approach of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) and influence diagrams to model the complex interactions of <b>aviation</b> system <b>risk</b> factors. Each KE session had a different set of experts with diverse expertise, such as pilot, air traffic controller, certification, and/or human factors knowledge that was elicited to construct a composite, systems-level risk model.

40|$|The {{demand and}} need for {{alternative}} obstruction marking has become a significant challenge for the wind power development in Sweden. While the development of wind turbines pushes for higher heights, the need to denote them as possible obstacles for aviation increase. To reduce undesired effects of the aviation warning lights in the landscape, various technologies for reducing the light emitted have been developed. One of these technologies control the lights’ output by dimming them based on measurements of the prevailing visibility {{in the vicinity of}} the wind farm. Visibility controlled obstruction lighting has not yet been used in Swedish wind farms. This thesis will investigate how a system can be applied from different viewpoints and what would be gained in a wind farm in northern Sweden.

40|$|There is a view, {{reflected}} in some safetycritical software {{research in the}} USA and in experience of safety assessments in Air Traffic Management in Europe, that safety stems largely from reliability of systems. Whilst that view may be appropriate for systems that are simply inherently dangerous (nuclear power plants for example), {{it would be far}} too narrow for the more general case of systems that have a specific safety-related purpose to fulfil – for example, car airbags, flight control systems and ATM – since it would exclude consideration of the positive contribution that such systems are required to make to the safety of their operational environment, host system etc. The paper discusses the implications of this issue for ATM and, whilst acknowledging that this limitation may not have been a major problem in the past (because of the hitherto gradual evolution of ATM systems) it explains why a pre-occupation with system failure (at the expense of functionality and performance) cannot be sustained in the face of more radical changes being considered for ATM over the next 20 years or so. The paper then presents a new framework, for a broader approach to ATM safety assessment, {{in the form of a}} high-level safety argument. It covers what are known as success and failure approaches: the former is concerned with ensuring that ATM systems / services actually deliver the necessary reduction in <b>aviation</b> <b>risk</b> (ie contribute to the prevention of aircraft accidents) when functioning as required; whilst the latter is concerned with ensuring that there would be no significant increase in risk (ie cause, or fail to prevent, accidents) in the event of system malfunction.

The investigation and modelling of aviation accident causation is dominated by linear models.

The holistic approach focuses on the system itself rather than any individual event. The activity and communication of constituent elements, both human and non-human agents, within that system is identified and highlights areas of system failure. The model offers many potential developments and some key areas are studied in this research. Through the centralisation of barriers and information nodes the method can be applied to almost any situation. The application of Bayesian mathematics to historical data populations provides scope for studying error migration and barrier manipulation. The thesis also provides application of these predictions to a flight simulator study in an attempt of validation. Beyond this the thesis also discusses the applicability of the approach to industry.

40|$|Volcanic eruptions {{take place}} in Iceland about once every 3 to 5 years. Ash {{emissions}} from these eruptions can cause significant disruption to air traffic over Europe and the North Atlantic as {{is evident from the}} 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull. Sulfur dioxide (SO 2) is also emitted by volcanoes, but there are no criteria to define when airspace is considered hazardous or nonhazardous. However, SO 2 is a well-known ground-level pollutant that can have detrimental effects on human health. We have used the United Kingdom Met Office's NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment) model to simulate SO 2 mass concentrations that could occur in European and North Atlantic airspace for a range of hypothetical explosive eruptions in Iceland with a probability to occur about once every 3 to 5 years. Model performance was evaluated for the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull summit eruption against SO 2 vertical column density retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and in situ measurements from the United Kingdom Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements research aircraft. We show that at no time during the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption did SO 2 mass concentrations at flight altitudes violate European air quality standards. In contrast, during a hypothetical short-duration explosive eruption similar to Hekla in 2000 (emitting 0. 2 Tg of SO 2 within 2 h, or an average SO 2 release rate 250 times that of Eyjafjallajökull 2010), simulated SO 2 concentrations are greater than 1063 [*]µg/m 3 for about 48 [*]h in a small area of European and North Atlantic airspace. By calculating the occurrence of aircraft encounters with the volcanic plume of a short-duration eruption, we show that a 15 min or longer exposure of aircraft and passengers to concentrations ≥ 500 [*]µg/m 3 has a probability of about 0. 1 %. Although exposure of humans to such concentrations may lead to irritations to the eyes, nose and, throat and cause increased airway resistance even in healthy individuals, the risk is very low. However, the fact that volcanic ash and sulfur species are not always collocated and that passenger comfort could be compromised might be incentives to provide real-time information on {{the presence or absence of}} volcanic SO 2.

The most frequently recorded categories were selected within each of five metrics: total accidents, fatal accidents, total injuries, fatal injuries and total incidents. This analysis was done separately for events within Part 121, Scheduled Part 135, Non-Scheduled Part 135 and Part 91. Combining those five sets of categories resulted in groups of between seven and eleven occurrence categories, depending on the flight operation. These groups represent 65 - 85 % of all accidents and 68 - 81 % of incidents...|$|R

40|$|Key to the {{continued}} growth of the civil Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) aviation sector is the devel- opment of a regulatory framework that will provide assurances {{in the management of}} the risks associated with their operation. Decisions in relation the evalu- ation and treatment of <b>aviation</b> <b>risks</b> need to be made in accordance with the As Low As Reasonably Prac- ticable (ALARP) framework. There are a number of concerns in relation to the application of the ALARP framework to new technologies. This paper explores these concerns with respect to the risk management of civil UAS. A review of the ALARP frameworks de ned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Australia), the Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom) and by the UK Health and Safety Executive is presented. This review identi ed subtle di erences that can have a signi cant impact on how ALARP frameworks would be applied to UAS. A number of inconsistencies in the frameworks were also identi ed. These issues aside, it was found that a conceptual application of an ALARP framework can be made. However, sig- ni cant diculties were identi ed in the substantia- tion of a framework. In particular, the quanti cation of the decision criteria for UAS, the handling of un- certainty, and the identi cation, characterisation and representation of societal concerns within a frame- work. Guidance as to how the dimensions of societal concern and levels of risk can be jointly considered within an ALARP framework could not be identi ed within the literature. For new technologies such asUAS, these dimensions can be as signi cant a factor in decision-making as that of the quanti ed measures of the risk. Due to these de ciencies, there are signif- icant diculties in the application and substantiation of an ALARP framework to the risk management of new technologies such as UAS...|$|R

Widebody and jumbo jets are also the only aircraft capable of creating long-term government liability through its commercial reinsurance. The US government's assumed risk through its insurance involvement can reach into the hundreds of billions of dollars.
