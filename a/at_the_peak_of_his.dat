5|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, Blake {{went on to}} become a plumber. He spent nearly 50 years in the {{plumbing}} business and was formerly the president of Plumbers Local 360. Blake was married to his wife, Carol Jean, for 47 years before her death. With Carol, he had a son, Ed, and a daughter, Peggy. His son, also named Ed Blake, was a former pitcher who played in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system from 1970 to 1973, playing for the AA affiliate Asheville Orioles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. His grandson, Ed Blake III, has continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather as a pitcher in high school. Blake died in Swansea, Illinois at the age of 83 after a long illness, and is interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Belleville, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E

5|$|Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was {{his final}} major {{compositional}} project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, {{though he never}} published it. During this time Sibelius was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of {{at least the first}} movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused {{to allow her to}} join Olivier in Pride and Prejudice (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.|$|E
5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was a strategy that altered the pace of the sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career.|$|E

5|$|Wilton H. St Hill (6 July 1893 – c. 1957) was a West Indian cricketer {{who played}} in West Indies' first Test match during their inaugural Test tour of England. A {{right-handed}} batman {{who played in}} a variety of batting positions, he represented Trinidad in first-class cricket between 1912 and 1930 and played in three Test matches in total. Although his Test record was poor, he was highly regarded in Trinidad. In particular, writer C. L. R. James considered St Hill to be among the top batsmen in the world and dedicated a chapter of Beyond a Boundary to him. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, Lord Harris described him as the best batsman in the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|By 1941, Göring was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{power and}} influence, and Hitler {{designated}} {{him as his}} successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of German cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.|$|E
5|$|He then struck 114 as {{his state}} {{defeated}} the tourists by an innings, {{and he made}} 40 and a duck as the Australians took the series lead in the Second Test. He made 70 and 71 in the Third Test loss in Sydney, {{one of the few}} players able to combat Lance Gibbs effectively, top-scoring in the first innings and second top-scoring in the second innings. He then made 65 in the second innings in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, where Australia held on by one wicket for a draw. He contributed 48 in the second innings of the Fifth Test as Australia appeared headed for a series victory. However, a late collapse ensued, and Australia scraped home by two wickets to take the series 2–1. O'Neill ended the series with 522 runs at 52.20. O'Neill gained attention during the summer for frequently losing his wicket by impulsively sweeping. This was attributed to the dominance of his bottom hand, which saw his bat swinging across the line of flight of the ball. Despite the criticism, he was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> international career, having made 1398 runs at 58.35 in his first 18 Tests.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Emir Assaf, they were confirmed as the rulers of Keserwan by Sultan Selim I following the Ottoman conquest in 1516. Emir Assaf died two years later and was succeeded by his son Hasan, who was in turn killed by his brother Qa'itbay. The latter ruled Keserwan until his death without children in 1523, after which he was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur. Mansur had a long reign and was accorded by the Ottomans numerous districts in Mount Lebanon and its environs as tax farms. He eliminated many of his Sunni rivals, and his local power relied on a Maronite support base and his Maronite agents, namely members of the Hubaysh clan, {{who served as a}} check on the Shia Muslim sheikhs of Keserwan. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power, Mansur's realm stretched from Beirut to Homs.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{original}} version had included Sheikh Patrash Pasha showing Tintin a copy of Tintin in America, in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier Tintin in the Congo, and Hergé would change it again for subsequent printings, this time to Destination Moon (1953), an Adventure set chronologically after Cigars. Benoît Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, the reader can imagine Tintin's surprise at encountering an adventure {{he had not yet}} had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met. Another anachronism in this version appears when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Hergé was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artistic ability.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{successfully}} withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman {{governors of}} the Sidon and Damascus provinces, {{who attempted to}} limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of Egypt Eyalet and with backing from the Russian Empire, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold {{in the summer of}} 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.|$|E

5|$|At {{this stage}} Johnston was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career {{in terms of}} bowling average and wickets taken per match. In his 24 Tests {{to the end of}} the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. In the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnston took match figures of 5/110, {{removing}} Weekes in both innings, before coming to the crease in the second innings to partner Doug Ring. Australia were 9/222 in pursuit of 260 for victory, with the series finely poised 2–1. The crowd of 30,000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat, with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match. However, the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38, which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket. Ring thought that playing for a draw was impractical, so he decided to attack, while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots. The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary, allowing Johnston to easily take singles, while Ring was able to clear the infield easily. The Richmond pair thought that Goddard's captaincy was poor. Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg, 35 minutes after he came to the crease.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of Worship is {{the second}} {{of a series of}} four oil {{paintings}} by Norman Rockwell entitled Four Freedoms. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941, known as Four Freedoms. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution are freedom of speech and freedom of religion. The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the Allies' World War II policy statement, the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). For the essay accompanying Freedom of Worship, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fame. At the time, Durant {{was in the midst of}} working on his ten-volume The Story of Civilization, coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy. Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E
