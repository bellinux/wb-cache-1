The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 CE. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 CE. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 CE). However, there are even earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BCE. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 CE) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCE23 CE), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife was terribly ill.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions {{up out of the}} subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we see and hear.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{anthropologist}} Helen Fisher, {{there are}} numerous psychological reasons for adultery. Some people may want to supplement a marriage, solve a sex problem, gather more attention, seek revenge, or have more excitement in the marriage. But based on Fisher's research, {{there also is a}} biological side to adultery. [...] "We have two brain systems: One of them is linked to attachment and romantic love, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> other brain system, which is purely sex drive." [...] Sometimes these two brain systems are not well connected, which enables people to become adulterers and satisfy their sex drive without any regards to their attachment side.|$|E

Hafeez said he's been marginalized by his {{community}} and family. Hafeez, who has found {{an appreciation for}} Sufi Islam, stated in a lecture that he felt more at home in Israel than anywhere else, and added [...] "I'm proud to call myself a Zionist". Hafeez visited university campuses around the UK presenting his talk, [...] "The Day I Stopped Hating Israel – Confessions of an ex-Radical." [...] In {{an interview with the}} Jewish Telegraph, Hafeez said: [...] "It's not about being pro-Israel or pro-truth, I just want the facts to be heard. Israel is a democratic state. Muslims in Israel have more rights than possibly most Muslims in the Arab world <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reality of the actual conflict. In the UK, most of us can't impact what will happen in Israel, we can't stop rockets falling from Gaza or forge a peace process, but we can tackle the delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel." ...|$|E

I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
