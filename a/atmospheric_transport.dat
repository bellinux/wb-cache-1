25|$|Endosulfan is a {{ubiquitous}} environmental contaminant. The chemical is semivolatile {{and persistent}} to degradation {{processes in the}} environment. Endosulfan is subject to long-range <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transport,</b> i.e. it can travel long distances from where it is used. Thus, it occurs in many environmental compartments. For example, a 2008 report by the National Park Service found that endosulfan commonly contaminates air, water, plants, and fish of national parks in the US. Most of these parks are far from areas where endosulfan is used. Endosulfan {{has been found in}} remote locations such as the Arctic Ocean, {{as well as in the}} Antarctic atmosphere. The pesticide has also been detected in dust from the Sahara Desert collected in the Caribbean after being blown across the Atlantic Ocean. The compound has been shown to be one of the most abundant organochlorine pesticides in the global atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the interactions between <b>atmospheric</b> meridional <b>transports</b> and the thermohaline circulation is presented, using a four-box ocean-atmosphere model in one hemisphere. The model is a simplified version of that developed by Nakamura, Stone, and Marotzke and is amenable to analytical solutions. The ocean model is Stommel's; the atmospheric model gives the surface heat and freshwater fluxes as residuals of the atmospheric energy and moisture budgets, assumed in balance. Radiation {{at the top of}} the atmosphere depends linearly on surface temperature; atmospheric meridional heat and moisture transports are proportional to the meridional temperature gradient. A Newtonian cooling law is derived for differential surface heat flux. The restoring coefficient is proportional to the efficiency of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transports</b> and inversely proportional to the relative ocean area compared to total surface area, Surface freshwater flux increases with increasing temperature gradient and is inversely proportional to the ratio of ocean area to catchment area. The range of stable solutions with high-latitude sinking is smaller than in related, uncoupled box models due to the dependence of freshwater flux on the temperature gradient, which leads to a positive feedback with the thermohaline circulation. A strong control of the temperature gradient by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transports</b> enhances the positive feedback between the salinity gradient and thermohaline circulation; simultaneously, it weakens the positive feedback between <b>atmospheric</b> moisture <b>transport</b> and the thermohaline circulation. Overestimating the <b>atmospheric</b> moisture <b>transport</b> and underestimating oceanic mass transport both artificially destabilize the high-latitude sinking state. Overestimating the <b>atmospheric</b> heat <b>transport</b> and hence the Newtonian restoring coefficient can be artificially stabilizing or destabilizing. These erroneous sensitivities are not alleviated if flux adjustments are added to obtain the correct mean climate, and then held fixed in climate change experiments. We derive alternate flux adjustment schemes, which do preserve the model's stability properties for particular sources of error...|$|R

Reversing the conventional approach of computing the ocean as an atmospheric model residual {{is done to}} permit calculation of a preliminary uncertainty estimate for the atmospheric flux. The structure of the ERBE errors is itself an important uncertainty. Total energy transport is almost indistinguishable from a hemispherically antisymmetric analytic function, despite the great asymmetry of the oceanic heat fluxes. ERBE data appear sufficiently noisy so that a considerable range of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transports</b> remains possible: the maximum atmospheric value lies between 3 and 5 PW in the Northern Hemisphere, at one standard deviation, although the values {{are sensitive to the}} noise assumptions made here. The Northern Hemisphere ocean and atmosphere carry comparable poleward heat fluxes to about 28 °N where the oceanic flux drops rapidly, but does not actually vanish until the oceanic surface area goes to zero. Within the estimated error bars, there is a remarkable antisymmetry about the equator of the combined ocean and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transports,</b> despite the marked oceanic transport asymmetry. 1...|$|R

40|$|A hybrid coupled ocean-atmosphere {{model is}} used to {{investigate}} {{the stability of the}} thermohaline circulation (THC) to an increase in the surface freshwater forcing in the presence of interactive meridional transports in the atmosphere. The ocean component is the idealized global general circulation model used in Part I. The atmospheric model assumes fixed latitudinal structure of the heat and moisture transports, and the amplitudes are calculated separately for each hemisphere from the large-scale sea surface temperature (SST) and SST gradient, using parameterizations based on baroclinic stability theory. The ocean-atmosphere heat and freshwater exchanges are calculated as residuals of the steady-state atmospheric budgets. Owing to the ocean component's weak heat transport, the model has too strong a meridional SST gradient when driven with observed <b>atmospheric</b> meridional <b>transports,</b> When the latter are made interactive, the conveyor belt circulation collapses. A Bur adjustment is introduced in which the efficiency of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transports</b> is lowered to match the too low efficiency of the ocean component. The feedbacks between the THC and both the atmospheric heat and moisture transports are positive, whether <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transports</b> are interactive in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere, or both. However, the feedbacks operate differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, because the Pacific THC dominates in the Southern Hemisphere, and deep water formation in the two hemispheres is negatively correlated. The feedbacks in the two hemispheres do nor necessarily reinforce each other because they have opposite effects on low-latitude temperatures. The model is qualitatively similar in stability to one with conventional "additive" flux adjustment, but quantitatively more stable...|$|R

30|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that ocean circulation damps the <b>atmospheric</b> energy <b>transport</b> response to hemispherically differential energy perturbations, thereby muting the shifts of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Here, we focus on the potential role of Ekman heat transport in modulating this atmospheric response. An idealized representation of Ekman-driven heat transport (FE) is included in an aquaplanet slab ocean coupled to a gray radiation atmospheric model. We first alter the strength of FE in the control climate by tuning the gross stability of the Ekman layer SE. For a wide range of FE, the total poleward transport of energy remains nearly unchanged, but the ocean transports an increasing share for larger SE. The control climate is then perturbed by adding surface cooling in the Southern Hemisphere and warming in the Northern Hemisphere. The Ekman coupling damps the <b>atmospheric</b> energy <b>transport</b> response, as in previous coupled model experiments with full ocean dynamics. The ratio of the changes in Ekman to <b>atmospheric</b> energy <b>transport</b> is determined by the ratio of the gross stability in the Ekman layer to the atmosphere in the control climate, and is insensitive to the amplitude and location of forcing. We find that an unrealistically large SE is needed to reproduce the ratio of the changes in cross-equatorial oceanic to <b>atmospheric</b> energy <b>transport</b> in fully coupled models. The limited damping effect of Ekman transport highlights the need to examine the roles of deep circulation and subtropical gyres, as well as ocean heat uptake processes.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{sensitivity}} of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC) regarding perturbations in fresh water flux for a range of coupled oceanic general circulation - atmospheric energy balance models. The energy balance model (EBM) predicts surface air temperature and fresh water flux and contains the feedbacks due to meridional transports of sensible and latent heat. In the coupled system we examine a negative perturbation in run-off into the southern ocean and analyze the role of changed <b>atmospheric</b> heat <b>transports</b> and fresh water flux. With mixed boundary conditions (fixed air temperature and fixed surface fresh water fluxes) the response is characterised by a completely different oceanic heat transport than in the reference case. On the other hand, the surface heat flux remains roughly constant when the air temperature can adjust in a model where no anomalous <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transports</b> are allowed. This gives an artificially stable system with nearly unchanged oceanic heat transport.
