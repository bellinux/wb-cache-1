These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century <b>and</b> <b>might</b> have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked {{together}} closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 {{he was appointed}} to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron {{could be used to}} study biochemical processes, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> become a weapon in the fight against cancer.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats, {{especially}} young kittens, {{are known for}} their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. Cats also engage in play fighting, {{with each other and with}} humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.|$|E
50|$|Up until Heroes of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic V, the Heroes series {{took place}} in the same fictional {{universe}} as the <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic series, <b>and</b> later <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic installments heavily referenced the games, with some taking place in the same world.|$|R

50|$|<b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, {{commonly}} {{abbreviated to}} <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic VI or simply MM6, is a role-playing video game developed by New World Computing {{and published by}} 3DO in 1998. It is the sixth installment in the <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic series, the sequel to <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic V: Darkside of Xeen and {{the first of the}} <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic titles to take place in the same world as Heroes of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic. It continues the storyline of Heroes of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic II, and takes {{place at the same time}} as Heroes of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic III in the series chronology.|$|R
5|$|During his {{backstage}} theatre job, Sellers began practising {{on a set}} {{of drums}} that belonged to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums <b>and</b> <b>might</b> have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic study revealed that A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 2007 it was suggested that the genera Azotobacter, Azomonas and Pseudomonas are related <b>and</b> <b>might</b> be synonyms.|$|E
5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} {{is typical of}} mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking. Poverty of thought {{is one of the}} negative symptoms of schizophrenia, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> also be a feature of severe depression or dementia. A patient with dementia might also experience thought perseveration. Formal thought disorder is a common feature of schizophrenia. Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|Before its bankruptcy, the 3DO Company {{produced}} two further spin-offs of the <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic series: Crusaders of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic <b>and</b> Warriors of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic. Neither of these games {{was developed by}} New World Computing, however. Similarly, a number of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic spin-off titles have been produced since the dissolution of New World Computing by Ubisoft and its associates. New World Computing {{was not involved in}} the production of any of these (including Dark Messiah of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic).|$|R
50|$|<b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum (also {{known as}} simply <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic) {{is an early}} {{role-playing}} video game, first in the popular <b>and</b> influential <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic franchise. It was released in 1986 as New World Computing's debut, ported to numerous platforms and re-released continuously through the early '90s.|$|R
25|$|The next <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic {{game was}} {{released}} in 2002 as <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic IX for Windows. Abandoning the now-dated <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic VI engine {{in favor of the}} Lithtech engine (also used in Legends of <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic), <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic IX was the first game in the series to be rendered entirely in 3D. Unfortunately, the release of the game was rushed, and the finished product was received poorly by critics, who noted the numerous software bugs remaining in the final release, most of which were not fully resolved by the sole patch released before New World Computing's dissolution. The most current game, released by Ubisoft in 2014, is <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic X.|$|R
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious <b>and</b> <b>might</b> bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E
5|$|In January, Lee lost in {{the final}} of Korea Open to Chen Long, his fourth {{straight}} defeat by the Chinese. He recorded his tenth Malaysia Open title a week later.

5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment. In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in {{the areas in which}} it is common, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> pose a threat to Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic III: Isles of Terra is {{the third}} game in the {{role-playing}} video game series <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic.

Based on the <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic III: Isles of Terra game engine, it is the fifth game in the <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic series, and is a direct sequel to <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic IV: Clouds of Xeen, concluding the story arc started in the original <b>Might</b> <b>and</b> Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum.|$|R

5|$|Ninox boobook remigialis {{is found}} on the Kai Islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands. Stresemann {{described}} it in 1930 from a specimen collected in 1909. Poorly known, it has been recorded twice more in 1998 and 2010. It has a call more similar to the barking owl, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> be classified as a subspecies of it instead.|$|E
5|$|Sumatran {{orangutan}} populations {{declined by}} 80% in 75 years.

5|$|Washington had {{considered}} abandoning Fort Washington, {{but he was}} swayed by Nathanael Greene, who believed the fort could be held {{and that it was}} vital to do so. Greene argued that holding the fort would keep open communications across the river <b>and</b> <b>might</b> dissuade the British from attacking New Jersey. Magaw and Putnam concurred with Greene. Washington deferred to Greene and did not abandon the fort.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. They believed that sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet <b>and</b> <b>might</b> result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E

5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century <b>and</b> <b>might</b> have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{federal investigation}} into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals.
