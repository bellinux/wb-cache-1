When he joined his new unit, {{it was difficult to}} foresee his outstanding career. His new Gruppenkommandeur, Eduard Neumann, later recalled, [...] "His hair was too long and he brought with him [...] a list of disciplinary punishments <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> arm. He was tempestuous, temperamental and unruly. Thirty years later, he would have been called a playboy." [...] Nevertheless, [...] Neumann quickly recognised Marseille's potential as a pilot. He stated in an interview: [...] "Marseille could only be one of two, either a disciplinary problem or a great fighter pilot." [...] Jagdgeschwader 27 was soon relocated to North Africa.|$|E

2500|$|Dirty Work {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 8 reviews. Entertainment Weekly gave this album a positive review, saying [...] "Dirty Work proves {{you can grow}} up and still act like a kid, just <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> songs are this head-rushingly catchy". AllMusic was also postitive, saying [...] "Consider Dirty Work the band's ultimate bid for mainstream acceptance, and one of their strongest pop albums to date". Alternative Press gave the album an average review, stating [...] "Guts, featuring The Sounds' Maja Ivarsson is a synth-assisted 6/8 number loaded with urgency and lyrical poignancy" [...] yet also notes [...] "Other tracks feel homogenized and lifeless, {{as if they were}} focus group to death. Time-Bomb is a Metro Station-aping electro-dance number that does nothing to actually make the listener dance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{clerical}} errors led to {{doubling of}} 100% identical characters such as 﨣 (U+FA23) and 𧺯 (U+27EAF). If your default font has glyphs encoded to both points {{so that one}} font is used for both, they should appear 100% identical. These cases are listed as z-variants (despite having no variance at all). Intentionally duplicated characters were added to facilitate bit-for-bit round-trip conversion. Because round-trip conversion was an early selling point of Unicode, this meant that if a national standard in use unnecessarily duplicated a character, Unicode {{had to do the}} same. Unicode calls these intentional duplications [...] "compatibility variants" [...] as with 漢. U+FA9A calls U+6F22 its compatibility variant. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> browser uses the same font for both, they should appear 100% identical. Sometimes, {{as in the case of}} 車 with U+8ECA and U+F902, the added compatibility character lists the already present version of 車 as both its compatibility variant and its z-variant. The compatibility variant field overrides the z-variant field, forcing normalization under all forms, including canonical equivalence. Despite the name, compatibility variants are actually canonically equivalent and are united in any Unicode normalization scheme and not only under compatibility normalization. This is similar to how the Angstrom symbol is canonically equivalent to a pre-composed Capital Latin Letter A with Ring Above (Å). Much software (like the wikipedia editing software, for example,) will replace all canonically equivalent characters that are discouraged (the Angstrom symbol) with the recommended equivalent (Capital Latin Letter A with Ring Above [...] ). Despite the name, CJK [...] "compatibility variants" [...] are canonically equivalent characters and not compatibility characters.|$|E
