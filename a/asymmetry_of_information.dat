50|$|The {{paper by}} Akerlof {{describes}} how the interaction between quality heterogeneity and asymmetric information {{can lead to the}} disappearance of a market where guarantees are indefinite. In this model, as quality is indistinguishable beforehand by the buyer (due to the <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information),</b> incentives exist for the seller to pass off low-quality goods as higher-quality ones. The buyer, however, takes this incentive into consideration, and takes the quality of the goods to be uncertain. Only the average quality of the goods will be considered, which in turn will have the side effect that goods that are above average in terms of quality will be driven out of the market. This mechanism is repeated until a no-trade equilibrium is reached.|$|E

50|$|There is also {{a second}} reason why section 13(2) would be more {{efficient}} then section 13(1) for items such as wedding photos. This reason {{is that there is}} probably <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> between the photographer and the client, meaning that the photographer is probably aware of the copyright rules while the client is probably not. Under the section 13(2) rule, because the client is initially vested with copyright, the photographer has to ask to buy the copyright from the client if the photographer wants the copyright. In the course of the negotiation, the client would become informed about the law. In this, section 13(2) is efficient in that it creates an incentive for more informed parties to share that information with less informed parties. As there is greater symmetry of information between the parties, transaction costs are less and bargaining is easier. However, if the photographer is the first owner of the copyright, he has no need to ask his client about purchase of the copyright and consequently {{it is unlikely that the}} client will learn about the copyright on the photographs.|$|E

In healthcare, a physician acts as an agent on behalf of the patient (the principal) guiding them to make the best possible treatment decisions.

Market demand and supply are the information of market actors about their intentions and capabilities.

According to the above-mentioned nature of the market and considering the role of information for it, market can be represented as the plurality-theoretic model. The <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> more specifically the <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> exchange is the result of uneven information provision of the entities of market relations. It is advisably to distinguish the nature of <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> as a fact and nature of the process and the consequences of its use by market entities. <b>Asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is an objective phenomenon at the time of its occurrence. The objective causes of the <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> in particular, is the variability of the environment, such as market situation that does not allow having complete information for all market participants (time of changes in demand when buyer knows more about their preferences for every moment or a period of time), objective “obsolescence” of information and the unreliability of its sources, inability to have all existing information through large quantities and respectively to process it for further use. Therefore, the existence of information is not negative and not positive. It simply exists as other natural phenomena. Somebody always knows more, but the way of taking this information advantage depends on the intentions of a person, the subjective approach to the situation and the chosen ways of problem solving. Information advantage is ownership of such information, the use of which allows market entity to improve the process of its activities and to promote competitive status. The process of using <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is a subjective phenomenon that depends on a person and can lead to positive or negative effects and therefore affect the functioning of the market. The negative effects of <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> are reduction of the share of honest producers, reduction of the availability of quality products and decrease of demand for products of particular producers. However, it is surprisingly that the presence of <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> can have positive effects, particularly, due to stimulation of honest sellers to improve their innovative activity in order to overcome <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> In the tourism market in contrast to commodity market, the amount of information owned by buyer depends not only on an intermediary selling tourist services or tourism packages (tourism enterprise), but also on the producers of tourist services. The elimination of <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in the tourism market is virtually impossible, because objective <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> will always exist for a buyer. <b>Asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on the tourist market has its own features regarding the origin, use and effects. This is due to the peculiarities of tourism enterprises and their cooperation with the suppliers of tourism services and the features of the tourism product as informational. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Generally, it should be noted that interest of the sellers in finding means of reducing the <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is inherent to the tourism market as for other markets in conditions of strong competition if the sellers plan to operate in the market for a long time. Their task is to find effective methods of managing external information flows directed to potential customers that require further research.
