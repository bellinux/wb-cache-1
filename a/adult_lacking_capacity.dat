40|$|Contemporary {{welfare is}} {{closely linked to}} {{policies}} designed to foster individual responsibility and self-development. This agenda, however, encounters problems when adults lack the capacity {{to make decisions about}} their lives, and/or are unable to protect themselves from the malign actions of their fellow citizens. These problems are addressed by the 2005 Mental Capacity Act (England and Wales) and adult safeguarding procedures. Specifically, the 2005 Mental Capacity Act (England and Wales) (MCA) introduced a statutory advocacy service, which empowers local authorities to appoint an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) to represent the interests of <b>adult</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>capacity</b> to make decisions about adult safeguarding procedures. This paper presents (i) a general overview of the development of adult safeguarding and the introduction of the MCAs IMCA service into these procedures; (ii) findings from a research project investigating the integration of IMCAs into these procedures; and (iii) a discussion of the challenges facing IMCAs involved in adult safeguarding procedures. © 2010 The Author...|$|E
40|$|In England and Wales, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) {{provides}} a new legal framework to regulate substitute decision-making {{relating to the}} welfare of adults who lack the capacity to make one or more autonomous decisions about their care and support. Any substitute decision made on behalf of an <b>adult</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>capacity</b> must be in his/her 'best interests'. However, the value of adopting established principles and procedures for substitute decision-making in practice is uncertain, and {{little is known about the}} legal or ethical dynamics of social care support, including the day-to-day residential support provided to adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). Methods This paper reports a qualitative, grounded theory analysis of 21 interviews with support workers working in residential care homes for adults with ID, and observations of care practices. Results In contrast to the narrow legal responsibilities placed upon them, it is argued that support workers interpret substitute decision-making within a broad moral account of their care role, orientating their support towards helping residents to live 'a life like ours'. In so doing, support workers describe how they draw on their own values and life experiences to shape the substitute decisions that they make on behalf of residents. Conclusions Support workers' accounts reveal clear discrepancies between the legal regulation of substitute decision-making and the ways that these support workers make sense of their work. Such discrepancies have implications both for the implementation of the MCA, and for the role of support workers' values in the conceptualisation and delivery of 'good' care...|$|E

40|$|When baby Charlie Gard was {{diagnosed}} with a rare mitochondrial disease, his parents located a Professor of Neurology in the USA willing to provide nucleoside therapy which offered a theoretical chance of improvement and successfully raised £ 1. 3 million through crowd funding. The decision that unproven therapy was contrary to Charlie Gard’s best interests and that life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn was devastating for his parents and difficult for their supporters to comprehend. The decision was upheld at three levels of appeal and Charlie died in July 2017 aged 11 months. This commentary provides a critical analysis of the legal principles surrounding unproven treatment and application of the best interests test in the different contexts of hospital and court.

An evaluation of recent case law suggests that the trajectory of a person’s life, their character and personality, and the perspectives of those with whom the patient has valued relationships are given increasing judicial recognition.

40|$|The best {{interest}} test {{is the legal}} mechanism which governs decision making on behalf of <b>adults</b> who <b>lack</b> the <b>capacity</b> {{to make their own}} health care treatment decisions. The test has attracted considerable criticism from health professionals, academics, judges and lawyers for being ill-defined and non-specific. The question of what is meant by '{{best interest}}s' remains largely unanswered. As a consequence, the test gives medical and legal decision makers considerable discretion to apply their personal value judgements within supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks - unreasoned and opaque decision making processes are the inevitable result. Because of the dominance of supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks, the place of values in decision making is not always fully understood. Reasoning is not possible without values, which stem from our emotions and passions, our upbringing, our religion, our cultures, our processes of socialisation and from our life experiences. Values help us make sense of our daily lives. I argue that law - like any other social institution - is essentially a human, values based construct. I put forward a theory of values-based law which argues for the recognition that laws, rules and conventions are based on, and contain, individual values. Currently, medical and legal decision makers justify grave decisions on behalf of society's most vulnerable citizens without revealing, or even acknowledging the values which drive and inform their decisions. Any opportunities to scrutinise or debate the values driving decisions are lost. Ultimately, values-based law argues that values underlying best interest determinations must be exposed to facilitate honest, transparent and fulsome decision making on behalf of <b>adults</b> who <b>lack</b> <b>capacity.</b> By applying the theory of values-based law, supposedly value-free decision making processes are exposed as insufficient to facilitate fulsome, honest and transparent legal reasoning...|$|R

Participants: 867 medical specialists from seven specialties most likely to be involved in end-of-life decision-making in the acute setting (emergency, geriatric, palliative, renal and respiratory medicine, medical oncology, and intensive care).

40|$|Background. Assessment of {{capacity}} plays {{a pivotal role}} in determining when decisions need to be made on behalf of an individual. It therefore has major clinical management implications for health care professionals and civil liberties implications for the person concerned. In many countries, there is a presumption that adults have the capacity to make health care decisions. However, in persons with a mental disability, capacity may be temporarily or permanently impaired. Methods. A selective review is presented which considers: (i) the broad approaches taken to determining capacity; (ii) the abilities commonly assessed in determining capacity; and (iii) the principles underlying health care decision-making for adults who are without capacity. Results. Capacity is a functional concept, determined by the person's ability to understand, retain, and weigh up information relevant to the decision in order to arrive at a choice, and then to communicate that choice. We have reviewed the studies that examined decision-making abilities in people with dementia, chronic mental illness or intellectual disabilities. Approaches to decision-making in <b>adults</b> who <b>lack</b> <b>capacity</b> include: anticipatory decisions made through advance health care statements or decisions by proxy based on ‘best interests’ or ‘substituted judgement’. Conclusions. The understanding of clinical and legal aspects {{of capacity}} is still developing. This paper examines current concepts of capacity and decision-making on behalf of those without capacity. We propose a framework, in line with current ethical and legal guidelines, as an aid to clinicians when they are seeking consent for a health care intervention. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the role played}} by law in medical specialists’ decision-making about withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment (WWLST) from <b>adults</b> who <b>lack</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{and the extent to which}} legal knowledge affects whether law is followed. Design: Cross-sectional postal survey of medical specialists. Setting: The two largest Australian states by population. Participants: 649 medical specialists from seven specialties most likely to be involved in end-of-life decision-making in the acute setting. Main outcome measures: Compliance with law and the impact of legal knowledge on compliance. Results: 649 medical specialists (of 2104 potential participants) completed the survey (response rate 31 %). Responses to a hypothetical scenario found a potential low rate of legal compliance, 32 % (95 % CI 28 % to 36 %). Knowledge of the law and legal compliance were associated: within compliers, 86 % (95 % CI 83 % to 91 %) had specific knowledge of the relevant aspect of the law, compared to 60 % (95 % CI 55 % to 65 %) within non-compliers. However, the reasons medical specialists gave for making decisions did not vary according to legal knowledge. Conclusions: Medical specialists prioritise patient-related clinical factors over law when confronted with a scenario where legal compliance is inconsistent with what they believe is clinically indicated. Although legally knowledgeable specialists were more likely to comply with the law, compliance in the scenario was not motivated by an intention to follow law. Ethical considerations (which are different from, but often align with, law) are suggested as a more important influence in clinical decision-making. More education and training of doctors is needed to demonstrate the role, relevance and utility of law in end-of-life care...|$|R
