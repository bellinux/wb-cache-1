500|$|... "Christmas Scandal" [...] {{was written}} by series co-founder Michael Schur and {{directed}} by Randall Einhorn. The episode featured {{the last of a}} string of guest performances by stand-up comedian Louis C.K., who reprised his recurring role as Dave Sanderson, Leslie's police officer boyfriend. Louis C.K. left the show to devote more time to his own upcoming series, Louie, which was to air in early 2010. Louis C.K. was widely praised for his brief stint on the show, where he adopts a deadpan, technical tone of voice far different from his usual comedy persona. Matt Fowler of IGN said, [...] "Louis C.K., known for being a raucous, raunchy comic, is almost frightening in his ability to play against his stage persona <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a wonderfully caring, and deadpan, character".|$|E

During qualifying, Elliott Sadler's changed his car's engine, after one failed during the session.

The following Wednesday, Benfica visited the Nou Camp in the second leg of the quarter-finals. Barcelona pressured hard and almost scored in the first five minutes with a penalty kick, with Moretto defending Ronaldinho's shot. A few minutes later, the Brazilian scored to make it 1–0 for Barça from open play. Benfica had the best chance to level in the 61th minute, but Simão missed an opportunity. Samuel Eto'o scored a late goal for Barcelona, putting Barça into the semi-finals. President Luís Filipe Vieira said, [...] "We were hoping to reach the final.

500|$|Wisden commented: [...] "The {{inclusion}} {{once again}} of Leyland was a move which yielded splendid results." [...] Coming in to bat at number three, Leyland shared a partnership of 382 with Len Hutton, {{at the time}} a record English Test partnership for any wicket; as of 2013, it remains England's highest partnership for the second wicket, and the highest for any wicket against Australia. As there was no time limit on the match, Leyland batted very cautiously and scored 187 in around six-and-a-half hours before he was run out. Hutton went on to score 364, at the time the highest score in Tests. England had batted deliberately slowly to frustrate the bowlers, and Cardus expressed his frustration to Leyland during an interval in play. Cardus wrote: [...] "'And even you, Maurice,' I complained, in sorrow not anger, 'even you won't hit the ball <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> some cricket.' 'Hey, wait a minute, Mr Cardus,' expostulated Leyland, as though pained at my protest, 'wait a minute—tha must remember that Ah'm playing for me place in team. England {{went on to win the}} match and level the series. Leyland's innings was his highest in Tests, but this was his final match for England. In 41 Tests, he scored 2,764 runs at 46.06 and took six wickets.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Kakha Kaladze's brother Levan, {{a medical}} student, was kidnapped in Georgia, with a ransom of $600,000 demanded. Georgia's {{president}} at the time, Eduard Shevardnadze, promised that [...] "everything {{is being done to}} locate him". Despite this assurance, the only time that Levan was ever seen was in a video where he was shown blindfolded and begging for help. Following the kidnapping, Kaladze threatened to take up Ukrainian citizenship, but reverted his decision, stating, [...] "There was a time when I thought about quitting the national side completely, but I couldn't do it out of respect for the Georgian people and the fans who come <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> such support." [...] Roughly four years later, on 6 May 2005, Georgian police officers found eight dead bodies in the Svaneti region and it was speculated that Levan was among the dead. On 21 February 2006, Levan was officially identified among the deceased, after tests from FBI experts. The local media claimed that the ransom was paid by Kaladze's family, although another source says that Kaladze's father attempted to meet the kidnappers, who fled as they believed he was followed by the police. Two men were sentenced to prison for the murder: David Asatiani for 25 years and Merab Amisulashvili for five years. On 14 July 2009, Kaladze's wife Anouki gave birth to their first-born son in Milan. The couple named their son Levan, in memory of Kaladze's brother.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake things up <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
