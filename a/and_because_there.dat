5|$|When Joe Nieuwendyk {{refused to}} report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim captain. The title was made {{permanent}} when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was nobody else capable of taking on the role. He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach Pierre Pagé.|$|E
5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} September {{and the end of}} December 1941, the Kozara Partisans {{conducted}} around forty {{military operations}} against the enemy. Stojanović helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of Podgradci, Mrakovica, and Turjak. Stojanović argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance toward other villages of the district of Gradiška, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was a sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans. On 23October 1941, Partisans under Stojanović's command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting. The sawmill and its stored productsincluding a large quantity of railroad ties, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukrainewere burnt down. Stojanović saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Ustaše and Croatian Home Guards were captured in Podgradci. The Ustaše were promptly executed, and the Home Guards were given a speech by Stojanović before the Partisans gave them food and escorted them across the Una River.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{mainstream}} medical ethics is biased by the assumption of a framework in which individuals are not free to contract with one another to provide whatever medical treatment is demanded, subject to the ability to pay. Because the welfare state typically provides a high proportion of medical care, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are legal restrictions on what treatment may be provided and by whom, an automatic divergence may exist between patient wishes and the preferences of medical practitioners and other parties.|$|E

25|$|Ghent prospered {{through the}} early 15th century, {{and a number of}} local councilors sought to {{establish}} a sense of independence from Burgundian rule. Philip was in financial difficulty, and asked the city for revenue, a burden many city councilors felt unreasonable and could ill afford, financially or politically. The situation became tense, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was division within the council over the burden, this led to a mistrust that meant council membership was dangerous and precarious. During a power play in 1432 a number of councilors were murdered, seemingly for their loyalty to Philip. Tensions came to with head in a 1433 revolt, which ended with the beheading of the councilors who had acted as ringleaders.|$|E
25|$|Tokelau {{has very}} scarce water {{resources}} <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are no fresh water surfaces {{on any of}} the atolls, it is solely dependent on rainwater as its source of fresh water. In recent years, climate change has resulted in much lower rain levels with drought periods lasting for much longer. This has made Tokelau along with many other islands in the Pacific struggle to conserve and store water for individual use. In the past, countries such as New Zealand and the United States have had to send emergency water supplies to Tokelau because it {{was on the verge of}} running out entirely. Sanitation facilities are also said to be poorly designed and wasting precious supplies of fresh water through the flushing system.|$|E
25|$|Females {{not only}} exert sexual control but {{also benefit from}} exerting such control over male {{reproductive}} success. It has been observed that in some species males continue to court females following copulation, which illuminates the fact above. This female control compels males to continue to impress their female counterparts following copulation. The assumption above can be made because there is an energetic cost for a male to continue to court a female following insemination because he has to invest energy to do so. <b>And,</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is an energetic investment he must benefit in some way. As such, sexual selection does not only act on traits that influence female mate choice of males but it also acts on male traits that determine his success following copulation.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the PPACA, {{hospitals}} and medical care facilities are forced to rethink the demand for nurses and non-physician providers. This is mainly because this new Act drew millions of people the opportunity at medical attention that did not have it before, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are so many new people in need of medical attention, the need for medical professionals also grows. With the combination of this new Act, and the aging Baby Boomer population, there {{is expected to be a}} large increase in the need for medical staff, especially physicians. Unfortunately, the Act did not account for the need for increased physician residency expansion thus creating an artificial shortage of physicians in an already-overloaded system. According to a study published in American Medical News (an online publication that no longer exists), nurse practitioners' jobs are expected to grow up to 130 percent from 86,000 in 2008 to 198,000 in 2025 through aggressive lobbying. Though there is some skepticism to these vast figures, they are backed up by many studies and the opinions of very well known medical professionals.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 2008, at Amway Arena, the Magic {{eliminated}} the Raptors with a 4–1 series {{victory in the}} first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first round exits. The run of success didn't last long as they fell 4–1 to the experienced Detroit Pistons in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons' Game 2 victory. At {{the conclusion of the}} 3rd quarter, Chauncey Billups of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any timing device to determine how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed {{from the time of the}} malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired. Because of the rule, the officials then estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> were 5.1 seconds remaining when play began, the field goal was allowed to be counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket in question should not have counted. The Pistons went on to win Game 2. The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons' Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury, but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic's playoff run in 2008.|$|E
