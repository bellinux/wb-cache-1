He {{was known for his}} strong defence of conventional Christian piety. The King was involved in the original construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including Nonsuch Palace, King's College Chapel, Cambridge and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings Henry improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as Christ Church, Oxford; Hampton Court Palace; the Palace of Whitehall; and Trinity College, Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry <b>at</b> <b>sports</b> events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
5|$|At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond excelled <b>at</b> <b>sports</b> {{including}} cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), {{football and}} fives. At Cirencester, he played football {{for the school}} first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred to be out playing cricket.|$|E

50|$|Contested ideological terrain is, in sociology, a {{theoretical}} framework that looks <b>at</b> <b>sport</b> as a cultural practice that reinforces both the certain existing power dynamics and the agency of human groups and individuals. Instead of looking <b>at</b> <b>sport</b> as a purely positive force, where individuals and groups of people can use sport {{as a means of}} achieving social mobility and success, or as a cultural practice that is solely detrimental, where sport reinforces the social inequalities in our world, this framework looks <b>at</b> <b>sport</b> as something that encompasses both.|$|R

5|$|Nicholas Tucker {{described}} the early Harry Potter books as {{looking back to}} Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses {{with which they were}} associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good <b>at</b> <b>sports,</b> but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.|$|E
5|$|The ground became dilapidated: a boy {{was killed}} when a wall {{collapsed}} during rioting in the 1980s. When new owners took the club out of administration in 1993, they began a six-year redevelopment programme during which the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium {{to comply with the}} Taylor Report into safety <b>at</b> <b>sports</b> grounds, and all areas apart from the Main Stand were completely rebuilt. The seating capacity of the modern stadium is around 30,000. It has function rooms suitable for business or social events and a club store selling Birmingham City merchandise. A 2004 proposal that the club should sell the ground and move into a multi-purpose City of Birmingham Stadium remains speculative. In 2013, the ground was listed as an Asset of Community Value under the Localism Act 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry and}} {{subsequent}} compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the {{incidents in the}} 1960s. The disaster also highlighted, however, {{the fact that there}} were no established safety standards that should be adhered to, let alone any means of enforcing such standards. This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier, after the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Guide to Safety <b>at</b> <b>Sports</b> Grounds was published in 1973, and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65,000. In the short term, Rangers took the stopgap measure of installing benches in the North Stand, which was renamed the Centenary Stand.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful <b>at</b> <b>sports.</b> He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E
5|$|Businessman Clifford Coombs {{took over}} as {{chairman}} in 1965, luring Stan Cullis out of retirement to manage the club. Cullis's team played attractive football which {{took them to the}} semifinals of the League Cup in 1967 and the FA Cup in 1968, but league football needed a different approach. Successor Freddie Goodwin produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semifinal. Two years later, the club raised money by selling Bob Latchford to Everton for a British record fee of £350,000, but without his goals the team struggled.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 38–39, 209–15. Sir Alf Ramsey briefly managed the club before Jim Smith took over in 1978. With relegation a certainty, the club sold Trevor Francis to Nottingham Forest, making him the first player transferred for a fee of £1million; Francis had scored a total of 133 goals in 329 appearances over his nine years at Birmingham. Smith took Birmingham straight back to the First Division, but a poor start to the 1981–82 season saw him replaced by Ron Saunders, who had just resigned from league champions Aston Villa. Saunders' team struggled to score goals and in 1984 they were relegated. They bounced back up, but the last home game of the 1984–85 promotion season, against Leeds United, was marred by rioting, culminating in the death of a boy when a wall collapsed on him. This was on the same day as the Bradford City stadium fire, and the events at St Andrew's formed part of the remit of Mr Justice Popplewell's inquiry into safety <b>at</b> <b>sports</b> grounds. The club lacked stability {{both on and off the}} field. Saunders quit after FA Cup defeat to non-League team Altrincham, staff were laid off, the training ground was sold, and by 1989 Birmingham were in the Third Division for the first time in their history.|$|E
