6000|$|... "Europe forms a {{political}} system, a body where the whole is connected by the relations and different interests of nations inhabiting {{this part of}} the world. It is not, as anciently, a confused heap of detached pieces, each of which thought itself very little concerned in the fate of others, and seldom regarded things which did not immediately relate to it. The continual attention of sovereigns to what is on the carpet, the constant residence of ministers, and the perpetual negotiations, make Europe a kind of a republic, the members of which, though independent, unite, through the ties of common interest, for the maintenance of order and liberty. Hence arose that famous scheme of the political equilibrium, or balance of power, by which is understood such a disposition of things <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>power</b> is able absolutely to predominate or to prescribe laws to others."--Book III. ch. iii. ยง 47.|$|E
60|$|And first, when {{he entered}} the room, he turned about and shut the door. 'Mrs. Betty,' said he, 'I fancied before {{somebody}} was coming upstairs, but it was not so; however,' adds he, 'if they find me in the room with you, they shan't catch me a-kissing of you.' I told him I did not know who should be coming upstairs, for I believed there was nobody in the house but the cook and the other maid, and they never came up those stairs. 'Well, my dear,' says he, ''tis good to be sure, however'; and so he sits down, and we began to talk. And now, though I was still all on fire with his first visit, and said little, he did as it were put words in my mouth, telling me how passionately he loved me, and that though he could not mention such a thing till he came to this estate, yet he was resolved to make me happy then, and himself too; that is to say, to marry me, and abundance of such fine things, which I, poor fool, did not understand the drift of, but acted as if {{there was no such thing}} as any kind of love but that which tended to matrimony; and if he had spoke of that, I had no room, as well <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>power,</b> to have said no; but we were not come that length yet.|$|E

5000|$|... 1845 - William McNaught (Glasgow) {{devised a}} method of fixing an {{additional}} high-pressure cylinder within an existing beam engine. To do so involved using a long pipe to connect the cylinders, and an extra set of valves to balance them. In effect this acted as a receiving chest, and {{a new type of}} compound had been invented. This system allowed greater control of the steam intake and cut-offs. An engine could be slowed by either a throttle which reduced the pressure of the steam, or by adjusting the cut-off on either cylinder. The latter was more efficient <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>power</b> was lost. The cycle was smoother as the two cylinders were not in phase.|$|E

40|$|The Distributed Architecture for Phased Array Antennas program, DISTAR, is a {{simulation}} tool {{used to study}} the implementation of distributed phased array hardware. DISTAR allows the placement of possibly faulty transmit/receive modules (T/R) at locations throughout the array. Variations in amplifiers and phase shifters may degrade antenna performance, depending on environmental conditions and array architecture. DISTAR enables the antenna designer to examine array characteristics and how they effect both type and extent of antenna failures. General specifications for amplifier and phase shifter tolerances may also be determined for various architectures. The array geometry {{is assumed to be}} rectangular with optional staggering in the X or Y direction. The array is divided into various subgroups both geometrically and electronically. Each T/R drives a subgroup of elemental radiators. Both hard and soft failures of the T/R amplifiers are modeled. Hard failures are catastrophic <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>power</b> is transmitted to those elements controlled by that particular amplifier. Soft, or non-catastrophic, failures are simulated by a modified Gaussian distribution. Flat, warped, and parabolic arrays can be modeled. The user must supply array geometry, amplitude and phase for each row and column, and location of all T/Rs. Specific or randomly chosen amplifiers may be deemed faulty. DISTAR outputs the normalized antenna gain patterns in the form of tables, and 2 -D or 3 -D graphs. DISTAR is written in FORTRAN 77 for interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX 11 / 780 computer operating under VMS 4. 4 with a central memory requirement of approximately 35 K of 8 bit bytes (without graphics). DISTAR requires the commercial DISSPLA plot library for full graphics implementation. This program was developed in 1986...|$|E
