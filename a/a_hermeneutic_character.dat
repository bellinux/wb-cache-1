40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{correlation}} between reflection and translation and proves the possibility to extrapolate the notion of "hermeneutic circle" into translation. Translation, which is understood as a specific speech activity, has <b>a</b> <b>hermeneutic</b> <b>character</b> as in its basis there is a "reflexive delay", a specific state of intelligence which {{occurs as a result}} of a language, ethnic or cultural barrier and demands a reflective action. At that, the circle is transformed into a spiral, which lets conceive the essence of every text fragment through its integration into the former comprehended layer. Interpretation, a reflexive action, which has a three-level structure, creates a unified image of a foreign text in the translator's consciousness and provides the integration of the text concept into the translator's pragmatic net, the representative of a foreign language community, and promotes the target text creation which conforms to the recipient's expectations. At that, the interpreter's personality, their ability to interpret, total existential competence and active position are of precedence for sense comprehension. Reflexive abilities refer to the category of the over-subjective; however, they provide adequate interpretation of the source text and creation of the so-called natural target text. The so-called des-objective reading, predicted synthesis and retrospective analysis are the key notions for the translator. Such abilities are the basis of the professional competence of the translator, who becomes not only a professional but also an intelligent personality that has existential and academic background...|$|E

This paper argues that what AI needs is not so much <b>a</b> <b>hermeneutic</b> approach as <b>a</b> better appreciation of biology and psychology. Understanding Computers and Cognition is a groundbreaking book that presents an important new approach to understanding what computers do and how their functioning is related to human language, thought and action. ...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly the {{philosophical}} discipline of hermeneutics is being {{applied to a}} systematic study of the human sciences. Yet <b>a</b> <b>hermeneutic</b> approach to psychotherapy has barely been considered. In this paper, the possible significance of <b>a</b> <b>hermeneutic</b> approach {{to the field of}} child psychotherapy is explored. Despite the fundamental differences between the two disciplines, both are faced with the task of understanding and interpreting the meaning of human expressions through words and images. Both encounter texts that call for deciphering. The author focuses first on the central concepts of experience, understanding and interpretation which {{lie at the heart of}} both disciplines. Subsequently, <b>a</b> <b>hermeneutic</b> approach to the expressions of experience in the form of child play and narratives is explored and some implications for child psychotherapy are drawn. Finally, <b>a</b> possible <b>hermeneutic</b> approach towards child psychotherapy is discussed...|$|R

Contributions to the systematic reflection on issues relevant for theology are also considered and the author’s own proposal is outlined.

40|$|Responding {{to calls}} {{to widen the}} range of {{qualitative}} approaches within management research, this paper addresses perceived difficulties in applying hermeneutic approaches to interview-based research and discusses how researchers can develop appropriate research designs. It reviews how tools from the hermeneutic tradition have been used, demonstrating how a sub-branch, critical hermeneutics, is particularly suited to the complexities of management research, offering a flexible means of exploring complex research relationships between ‘texts’, contexts and the researcher. The paper details the inception and implementation of <b>a</b> <b>hermeneutic</b> research project and demonstrates the application of <b>a</b> four-stage <b>hermeneutic</b> analytical framework for use with interview transcripts. In showing how interviews are co-created through <b>a</b> <b>hermeneutic</b> process between the research participants and the researcher, the paper suggests ways of acknowledging {{the implications of this}} relationship and thus of increasing researcher reflexivity within the research process. The benefits and limitations of implementing such hermeneutic research designs are then discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Rhetorical hermeneutics {{is about}} a way of reading texts as rhetoric. Rhetoric is both a {{discipline}} and a perspective from which disciplines can be viewed.

Whether rhetorical theory can function as <b>a</b> general <b>hermeneutic,</b> <b>a</b> key to all texts, including scientific texts, is still today a point of interest to rhetoricians.
