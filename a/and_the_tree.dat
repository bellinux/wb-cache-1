5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> was permanently weakened.|$|E

5|$|Chastain's {{final two}} {{roles of the}} year were in Wilde Salomé, a {{documentary}} based on her 2006 production of Salome, and the critically panned crime-thriller Texas Killing Fields. The latter, co-starring Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, was a partly fictionalized version of {{the events in the}} killing fields of Texas, in which she played a homicide detective. Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain's polished Texas drawl, but criticized the film. Chastain's work in 2011, especially in The Help, Take Shelter <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tree</b> of Life, gained her awards from several critics' organizations, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.|$|E

5|$|Gyges– Featured in the God of War comics #4, #5, and #6, {{he was one}} of {{the three}} Chaos Giants with one hundred arms and fifty heads. During Kratos' first quest for the Ambrosia, his battle with Cereyon burned off the hundred arms of Gyges. During Kratos' second quest, Gyges {{revealed}} that he had planned to use the Ambrosia to revive his brothers, Briareus and Cottus, and then reclaim the world, but Kratos' initial retrieval thwarted that plan. Kratos destroyed both Gyges <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> of Life — which contained the Ambrosia — with the Fire of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|Chastain {{made her}} film {{debut in the}} drama Jolene (2008), and gained wide {{recognition}} in 2011 for starring roles in half a dozen films, including the dramas Take Shelter <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tree</b> of Life. Her performance as an aspiring socialite in The Help earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. In 2012, she won a Golden Globe Award and received an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for playing a CIA agent in the thriller Zero Dark Thirty. Chastain made her Broadway debut in a revival of The Heiress in the same year. Her highest-grossing releases came with the science-fiction films Interstellar (2014) and The Martian (2015), and she continued to draw praise for her performances in the dramas The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby (2013), A Most Violent Year (2014), and Miss Sloane (2016).|$|E

5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
