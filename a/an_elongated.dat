5|$|Carcharhiniformes: Commonly {{known as}} ground sharks, the order {{includes}} the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the requiem sharks) {{along with the}} houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Later a {{portrait}} of Moreno was discovered {{that had been done}} from life, by the Peruvian silversmith Juan de Dios Rivera. This portrait was painted between 1808 or 1809, before Moreno's appointment as secretary of the Junta. It is now considered to be the closest representation of Moreno's real appearance. In this portrait, he is depicted with <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> face, abundant hair, long sideburns, big eyes, and a pointy nose.|$|E
5|$|The {{art critic}} Hugh Davies has {{suggested}} that of the three figures, that on the left most closely resembles a human form, and that it might represent a mourner at the cross. Seated on a table-like structure, this limbless creature has <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> neck, heavily rounded shoulders, and a thick mop of dark hair. Like its affiliate objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have <b>an</b> <b>elongated,</b> anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry {{entered the}} eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after {{bypassing}} St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40km/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, satellite observations {{indicated that the}} storm was poorly organized, with <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad {{area of low pressure}} with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Corona Australis' {{location}} {{near the}} Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen. NGC 6768 is a magnitude 11.2 object 35â€² south of IC 1297. It {{is made up}} of two galaxies merging, one of which is <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> elliptical galaxy of classification E4 and the other a lenticular galaxy of classification S0. IC 4808 is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of Beta Sagittarii. However, amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes. The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of its duration, Agatha steered toward the north while {{embedded}} within a deep southerly flow. Steady intensification continued, and the storm reached winds of 50 mph (90 km/h) six hours after being upgraded as it neared the coast of Mexico. By the afternoon of June 2, the center exhibited <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> appearance within its associated central dense overcast, a large area of organized mid-tropospheric convection. Around 1800 UTC that same day, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg).|$|E

5|$|Gresley's initial Pacific {{project of}} 1915 was for <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> {{version of the}} Ivatt Atlantic design with four cylinders. Finally {{realising}} {{that he was in}} a design impasse, he took as a model the new American Pennsylvania Railroad class K4 Pacific of 1914. This in turn had been updated from a series of prototypes scientifically developed in 1910 under Francis J. Cole, Alco's Chief Consulting Engineer at Schenectady and the Pennsylvania's K29 Alco prototype of 1911, also designed by Cole. Descriptions of those locomotives appeared in the British technical press at the time and gave Gresley the elements necessary to design a thoroughly up-to-date locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E
5|$|Laridae is {{a family}} of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are {{typically}} grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have <b>an</b> <b>elongated</b> lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.|$|E
