5|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century the club {{struggled}} financially, paying players £10-a-week and manager Dennis Newall became the first unpaid manager at senior level in Scottish football. As a result, the club ranked last in the Scottish Football League for five consecutive seasons from 2002–03 to 2006–07, losing 24 consecutive league games in the 2003–04 season, recording only 8 points from two wins and two draws in 36 games. From the 2005–06 season, it was determined if a club finished bottom of the Third Division twice in successive years, it would face the risk of being reduced to associate member status, meaning the loss of voting rights. In East Stirlingshire's case, a league vote was held and concluded in favour of the club retaining full member status with the condition that it did not finish last the following season in 2008. The club won its final game of the season to move off the bottom of the table in a 3–1 win against Montrose, which was also the last game <b>at</b> <b>Firs</b> Park. The following season, retaining full member status, the club moved to Ochilview Park in a ground-share agreement with neighbours Stenhousemuir.|$|E

The agreement is initially intended to be for a period of five years, during which the club hopes to develop a new venue in Falkirk.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{prohibitive}} {{costs of}} improving facilities to meet regulations {{set by the}} Scottish Football Association, the club decided to leave Firs Park {{at the end of}} the 2007-08 season. The last ever league game to be played <b>at</b> <b>Firs</b> Park was a 3-1 victory for the Shire against Montrose F.C., which meant the club avoided finishing bottom of the Scottish Football League for a sixth consecutive season.|$|E

50|$|The {{second largest}} playing fields are <b>at</b> <b>Firs</b> Farm on Firs Lane. There are {{a handful of}} rugby pitches along with more than a dozen {{football}} pitches. These are used by local amateur football clubs including Winchmore Hill FC, Mayfield Athletic FC and Southgate County FC. The pitches drain reasonably well but are generally in poor condition with old, rusted goalposts. The changing facilities are also very dilapidated, with some changing rooms being no more than concrete sheds with corrugated roofs.|$|E

50|$|In 1920, {{the club}} was forced to move from Bainsford when a railway line was built across Merchiston Park. The club set about {{looking for a new}} site to play its home games and a {{derelict}} factory site on Firs Street in Falkirk was chosen. The site was named Firs Park after the street in which it was located and was officially opened in 1921 and would be the club's home for the next 87 years. The first ever opposition <b>at</b> <b>Firs</b> Park was Heart of Midlothian F.C..|$|E
50|$|Shortly after opening, the club's record {{attendance}} {{was set on}} 21 February 1921 in a Scottish Cup third round tie against eventual champions Partick Thistle F.C., when 12,000 people watched the match. This remained the record attendance for the club during its entire tenure <b>at</b> <b>Firs</b> Park as crowds became smaller due to crowd regulation. In 2007, a limit of 750 was set by police during a Challenge Cup tie with Greenock Morton F.C.. This {{was due to the}} small number of turnstiles and there only being one main exit gate.|$|E

G. Elliott" [...] who was apparently reluctant to reveal the information to Fabian without authority from his Headquarters.|$|E
