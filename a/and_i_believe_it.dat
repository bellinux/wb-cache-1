Additional reasons given by Hayes ten months after the departure include [...] "They didn't pay me enough", and [...] "They weren't that nice". In late 2007, reports emerged claiming that Hayes was in no condition to stay, because of a stroke he suffered in January. According to a Fox News article, Hayes' agent Christina Kimball, herself a practicing Scientologist, was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park. Stone lent support to this view in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, commenting that [...] "There are reports that Isaac had a stroke and Scientology quit the show for him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it...</b> It was a brutal, up-close, personal thing with Isaac. If you look at the timeline, something doesn't add up." [...] Due to the absence of Hayes, Chef was voiced in [...] "The Return of Chef" [...] using pre-recorded snippets of dialog from previous episodes. The character was written out of the series by being struck by lightning, burned, impaled, shot, and mauled {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

2500|$|Murakami {{claims that}} it is natural for China and the two Koreas to {{continue}} to feel resentment toward Japan for its wartime aggression. [...] "Fundamentally, Japanese people tend not to have an idea that they were also assailants, and the tendency is getting clearer," [...] he said. In an interview, Murakami stated [...] "The issue of historical understanding carries great significance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is important that Japan makes straightforward apologies. I think that is all Japan can do – apologise until the countries say: 'We don't necessarily get over it completely, but you have apologized enough. Alright, let's leave it now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many Republican U.S. presidential {{candidates}} at the time, among them Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump, responded by claiming the United States was at war. Chris Christie, who was campaigning in Iowa at the time, declared, [...] "What {{the fact is}} this is a new world war and one that won't look like the last two. And this is one where it's radical Islamic jihadists everyday are trying to kill Americans and disrupt and destroy our way of life." [...] Jeb Bush stated, [...] "If this is a war, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is since they have declared war on us, we need to declare war on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit {{that one of the reasons}} I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scott's novel Old Mortality, {{published}} in 1816, was largely set {{in and around}} Tillietudlem Castle. Chapter XI describes the location: [...] "All heads were now bent from the battlements of the turret, which commanded a distant prospect down the vale of the river. The Tower of Tillietudlem stood, or perhaps yet stands, upon the angle of a very precipitous bank, formed by the junction of a considerable brook with the Clyde." [...] In June 1829 {{he wrote to his}} friend James Skene, who was preparing etchings to illustrate Scott's books, [...] "I did not think on Craignethan in writing about Tillietudlem, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> differs in several respects from my Chateau en Espagne. It is not on the Clyde in particular, and, if I recollect, the view is limited and wooded. But that can be no objection to adopting it as that which public taste has adopted as coming nearest to the ideal of the place." [...] In the revised Magnum Edition of Old Mortality, {{published in}} 1830, Scott added a footnote: [...] "The Castle of Tillietudlem is imaginary; but the ruins of Craignethan Castle, situated on the Nethan, about three miles from its junction with the Clyde, have something of the character of the description in the text". In September 1834 Scott's son in law John Gibson Lockhart took the artist J. M. W. Turner to visit Craignethan. Turner made a sketch of the castle from the north, seen across the Nethan Gorge, then made several drawings in and around the ruins.|$|E
