5000|$|Makida Moka as Monye, Eki’s younger sister, a model who {{has always}} had a crush on Obi. Obi however <b>always</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her like a younger sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "Except Lionel," [...] said Clara, [...] "if their admiration is mutual. But, by the by, Miss Morley, {{why do you}} not {{desire to}} see her letters? You <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} it all depends," [...] he {{answered}} dreamily. [...] "Maybe we'd never have suited one another; you can <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it that way. Still, I'd like to have tried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall go to {{the summit}} of the hill above this cave, and see what is to be seen there. <b>Always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> both sides of a mystery if you would fathom it; come along." ...|$|E
25|$|The various {{owners and}} builder-owners have <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the palace {{and at the}} {{surrounding}} gardens as corresponding elements. Thus, every succeeding generation has carried out significant alterations.|$|R

6000|$|... "To be sure. But it's such {{a comfort}} being {{where you can}} see the Advertiser the same morning. I <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Weather Report the first thing. I like to know what the weather is going to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do not you?' said Helen; 'does not Lizzie say {{the sharpest}} things possible? I am sure she does to me, {{and she never}} likes {{anything}} I do. If there is any little fault in it, she and Papa <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that, rather than anything else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you have}} love and courage enough to {{undertake}} this journey, whenever {{you come to}} a cross-road <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this diamond before you settle which way you are going to take.

6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} be <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> dark things, or else he seems as if--as if he could--enjoy himself too much. I thought--I thought at first," [...] she stammered, [...] "that we could do him good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may think}} that is coldness," [...] exclaimed Valentin; [...] "but it is not, it is warmth. It shows she is {{treating}} you as an intimate. Now she detests me, and yet she is <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{means that}} you are <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him, my dear,” says her mother, archly. Beatrix ran away from Esmond at this, and flew to her mamma, whom she kissed, {{stopping}} my lady’s mouth with her pretty hand.|$|R
6000|$|Gwendolen. Yes, but {{men often}} propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does. All my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest! They are quite, quite, blue. I {{hope you will}} <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me just like that, {{especially}} when {{there are other people}} present. [Enter Lady Bracknell.] ...|$|E
6000|$|It hung in {{the royal}} parlor over the royal sideboard, and Princess Angelica could <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as she sat making the tea. Each day it seemed to grow handsomer and handsomer, and the Princess grew so fond of looking at it, that she would often spill the tea over the cloth, at which her father and mother would wink and wag their heads; and say to each other, [...] "Aha! we see how things are going." ...|$|E
60|$|Passing {{through this}} they found {{themselves}} in a large hall with two domes set {{side by side in the}} roof. The domes were formed of stained glass, and the walls of the hall were ornamented by pictures in pairs, each pair showing identically the same scenes. This, was, of course, reasonable enough in such a land, where two people would <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> two pictures at the same time and admire them in the same way with the same thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't <b>always</b> easy to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a man's life. We are <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> men's lives, {{and always}} making mistakes. The bishop {{thinks he is}} a good sort of fellow, and the bishop isn't the man to like a debauched, unbelieving, {{reckless}} parson, who, according to your ideas, must be leading a life of open shame and profligacy. I'm inclined to think there must be a mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her face {{so bright}} and calm! her watchful, weeping eyes <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me, {{with a light}} in them that shines steady through the quivering tears. While the light lasts, I shall live; when it begins to die out--* ...|$|R

60|$|As {{we arrive}} in the {{vicinity}} of Lincoln’s-inn-fields, Bedford-row, and other legal haunts, we drop a great many of our original passengers, and take up fresh ones, who meet with a very sulky reception. It is rather remarkable, that the people already in an omnibus, <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> newcomers, as if they entertained some undefined idea that they have no business to come in at all. We are quite persuaded the little old man has some notion of this kind, and that he considers their entry as a sort of negative impertinence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's quite obsolete," [...] Minver said. [...] "They only {{play the}} flute in the orchestras now. I <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the man who}} plays it and think of my uncle. He used to be very nice {{to me as a}} child; and he was very fond of my father, in a sort of filial way; my father was so much older. I can {{remember}} my young aunt; and how pretty she was as she sat at the piano, and sang and played to his fluting. When she looked forward at the music, her curls fell into her neck; they wore curls then, grown-up women; and though I don't think curls are beautiful, my aunt's beauty would have been less without them; in fact, I can't think of her without them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hired {{this off}} of my Lord Marshalton,' Zigler explained, while they helped {{us out of}} our coats under the severe eyes of ruffed and periwigged ancestors. 'Ya-as. They <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me too, as if I'd blown in from the gutter. Which, of course, I have. That's Mary, Lady Marshalton. Old man Joshua painted her. Do you see any {{likeness}} to my Lord Marshalton? Why, haven't you ever met up with him? He was Captain Mankeltow--my Royal British Artillery captain that blew up my gun in the war, an' then tried to bury me against my religious principles[4]. Ya-as. His father died and he got the lordship. That was about all he got {{by the time that}} your British death-duties were through with him. So he said I'd oblige him by hiring his ranch. It's a hell an' a half of a proposition to handle, but Tommy--Mrs. Laughton--understands it. Come right in to the parlour and be very welcome.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, he {{was only}} a clerk, but he was a duck of a man, with regular auburn hair, you know. And he sang! We used to go to the Choral Society concerts, and he sang ballads so beautifully, and <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Louie!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t want {{to escape}} notice. People have <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me and I guess they always will. But there are {{different}} ways of being <b>looked</b> <b>at,</b> and I know the way I want. I mean to have it too!” Mrs. Headway prettily shrilled. Yes, she was full of purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Adrián García as Anselmo Rodríguez. A highly-worried elder who's <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the {{possible}} negative outcomes of situations. He is nicknamed [...] "Elmo" [...] by Pablo, to which Anselmo repeatedly hates. He is initially repulsed by Margarita's strongly affections towards him, but later marries her.|$|R
60|$|A {{man with}} his intellect a clear, plain, {{geometric}} mirror, brilliantly sensitive of all objects and impressions around it, and imagining all things in their correct proportions--not twisted up into convex or concave, and distorting everything, so that he cannot see {{the truth of the}} matter without endless groping and manipulation--healthy, clear, and free, and all round about him. We never can attain that at all. In fact, the operations we have got into are destructive of it. You cannot, if you are going to do any decisive intellectual operation--if you are going to write a book--at least, I never could--without getting decidedly made ill by it, and really you must if it is your business--and you must follow out what you are at--and it sometimes is at the expense of health. Only remember at all times to get back as fast as possible out of it into health, and regard the real equilibrium as the centre of things. You should <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the heilig, which means holy, and holy means healthy.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is nothing}} to see in Nuoro: which, to tell the truth, is always a relief. Sights are an irritating bore. Thank heaven there isn't a bit of Perugino or {{anything}} Pisan in the place: that I know of. Happy is the town {{that has nothing to}} show. What a lot of stunts and affectations it saves! Life is then life, not museum-stuffing. One could saunter along the rather inert, narrow, Monday-morning street, and see the women having a bit of a gossip, and see an old crone with a basket of bread on her head, and see the unwilling ones hanging back from work, and the whole current of industry disinclined to flow. Life is life and things are things. I am sick of gaping things, even Peruginos. I have had my thrills from Carpaccio and Botticelli. But now I've had enough. But I can <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> an old, grey-bearded peasant in his earthy white drawers and his black waist-frill, wearing no coat or over-garment, but just crooking along beside his little ox-wagon. I am sick of [...] "things," [...] even Perugino.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cobban opens badly by {{describing}} my letter, setting Mr. Whibley right on {{a matter of}} fact, as an 'impudent paradox.' The term 'impudent' is meaningless, and the word 'paradox' is misplaced. I am afraid that writing to newspapers has a deteriorating influence on style. People get violent and abusive and lose all sense of proportion, when they enter that curious journalistic arena in which the race is always to the noisiest. 'Impudent paradox' is neither violent nor abusive, {{but it is not}} an expression that should have been used about my letter. However, Mr. Cobban makes full atonement afterwards for what was, no doubt, a mere error of manner, by adopting the impudent paradox in question as his own, and pointing out that, as I had previously said, the artist will <b>always</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the work of art from the standpoint of beauty of style and beauty of treatment, and that those who have not got the sense of beauty, or whose sense of beauty is dominated by ethical considerations, will always turn their attention to the subject-matter and make its moral import the test and touchstone of the poem or novel or picture that is presented to them, while the newspaper critic will sometimes take one side and sometimes the other, according as he is cultured or uncultured. In fact, Mr. Cobban converts the impudent paradox into a tedious truism, and, I dare say, in doing so does good service.|$|E
50|$|A {{short and}} simple story based on true life event. We all {{are so busy}} in our day to day {{activities}} and are <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the bigger picture but, in the process we sometimes forget that the small simple act can bring smile on someone’s face.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, [...] "The John Ankerberg Show" [...] interviewed Gross in {{reference}} to his continued {{use of the term}} [...] "Mahanta" [...] (the inner spiritual master revered in Eckankar), and he said, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> myself as not the Mahanta but a vehicle for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{outstanding}} {{feature of}} his poetry is {{the tension between}} mysticism and eroticism. Sánchez Peláez <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his erotic objects as distant entities, separate from the mundane through the metaphysical veil. Ludovico Silva, in his [...] "Juan Sanchez Pelaez, The real and illusionary" [...] states: ...|$|R
