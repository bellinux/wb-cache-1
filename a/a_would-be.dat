5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that <b>a</b> <b>would-be</b> Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{meets with}} Frank Briggs, the detective who {{investigated}} Tooms' 1933 murders. Briggs {{claims that the}} body {{of one of the}} victims from that spree was never discovered. Scully and Briggs visit a chemical plant where a piece of the victim's liver was found, ultimately discovering a skeleton encased in concrete. Meanwhile, Mulder harasses Tooms at work as he stalks <b>a</b> <b>would-be</b> victim. Later that night, Mulder follows him when he tries to break into a man's house. Tooms flees without attacking anyone.|$|E
5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. <b>A</b> <b>would-be</b> adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E

5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into <b>a</b> <b>would-be</b> predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|As the {{rationalisation}} programme was winding down, Sjarifuddin began gathering {{soldiers from}} the Socialist Party, Communist Party, {{and members of the}} All Indonesia Centre of Labour Organizations for <b>a</b> <b>would-be</b> proletarian revolution in Madiun, East Java, which occurred on 18September 1948. Sudirman, ill at the time, sent Nasution to deal with the revolution; Sudirman also sent two other officers as peace feelers before the attacks. Although the revolutionary leader Muso was amenable to peace, Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30September. Sudirman visited Madiun not long after the battle, later telling his wife that he had been unable to sleep there for all the bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate <b>a</b> <b>would-be</b> predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E

5|$|Hester {{finished}} {{the season with}} six kicks returned for touchdowns, which set a league record. He {{finished the}} season ranking fourth on the League’s all-time combined kick return list, behind Brian Mitchell (13), Eric Metcalf (12), and Dante Hall (12). Additionally, he amassed 299 yards on twenty receptions as a receiver, though he was often used as a decoy. His play on offense received mixed commentary. While the Bears’ coaching staff believed Hester showed enough progress {{to become one of}} the team's top receivers in 2008, Hester was prone to making small errors, including running routes incorrectly or dropping catches. He drew a fifteen-yard facemask penalty while attempting to fend off <b>a</b> <b>would-be</b> tackler in a game against the Saints, and received a $5,000 fine. Nevertheless, Hester concluded the season with four Player of the Week Awards, giving him a franchise-high total of seven in his career, and an invitation to the 2008 Pro Bowl.|$|E
