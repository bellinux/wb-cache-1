Fernandes was already {{known for his}} works in Slumdog Millionaire and Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na. According to him Bhansali [...] "..wanted to make the song {{different}} and unique. I asked him if we can <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> Spanish to it {{and give it a}} raw, earthy feel. He liked the idea, so we gave the whole dance a very rustic look {{in order to make it}} look as natural as possible". The choreographer added that the dance sequence was very distinct in that the audience had never seen Rai doing such steps. He went gaga over the lead actress saying that she danced like a dream. Longinus said in an interview that it [...] ".. did not take her long to learn the dance but it did take her some time to perfect it and to get into the mood of the character". In an interview Sanjay Leela Bhansali said that in the song Udi, [...] "..with such few words Sofia manages to say so much. It was my tribute to Waheeda Rahman's character in Guide."In a sequence from the film, Ethan explains Omar, that the first magic he had performed was for his mother. Bhansali said that it is inspired from his childhood days. He said, [...] "I remember my grandmother selling off the last of her silver and storing chillar in large Johnson baby powder tin. Every afternoon she would count that money and put it back. That kurr-kurr of the coins being bought out, counted and put back had to be heard again. The value of those coins doesn't exist anymore but it was an important part of my growing up." [...] Since Roshan's character, Ethan, plays a magician in the initial portion of the film, a Ukrainian magician was hired for teaching him magic tricks, after a long search for a professional magician. The magic stunts performed by Roshan and Monikangana Dutta formed the major portion of the film shot in the last schedule.|$|E

According to tradition, the best tasting pempek are made of belida or belido (Chitala lopis), but due to its rarity and superior taste, pempek made from this fish are usually more expensive. Pempek in Bangka Island are made from mackerel (ikan kembung) and its sauce is red chilli based, while in Jakarta or other cities they could be made from gourami fish.

For me, it was about getting out of my comfort zone. This album is a lot about that too. I was used to producing my own records and singing my own hooks and it was out of necessity at first in my career because I couldn’t afford to pay for beats and I didn’t have anybody to sing on the hooks. At this point of my career, I want to create and write in a manner where I can always take it to the next level. It was dope to get in with Rico because he has a gift for writing hooks that are relatable for everybody. It doesn’t matter where you’re from and it doesn’t matter who you are, you can relate to these hooks. When he sent that to me, I was like “I got it” as far as the verses and it was just dope to be able to <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> my edge and my southern twang to it. I can still be myself, but make a record as big as “Pay Attention” and showcase my growth as I’m getting older. I want to put that in my music. I’m not K.R.I.T. from 2010." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hardware and {{software}} design requires the right portion {{of skills and}} mental faculties. The design of a good system {{is an exercise in}} rational thinking, engineering, and art. The design process is further complicated when we aspire to build systems that exploit parallelism or are targeted to be deployed on architecturally diverse computing devices, FPGAs or GPUs to name just a few. The need to develop systems that can take advantage of computing devices beyond general purpose CPUs is real. There are several application domains and research efforts that will simply not be able to adequately perform or yield answers in a reasonable amount of time otherwise. Developing a mathematical model of a system is a key stepping stone to a high performance system, but often is absent from the design process due to the complexity of the model development. In this paper we offer an easy, yet solid approach to the development of such mathematical models. This <b>adds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more weight to engineering side of the design process {{in the form of a}} quantifiable method that enables designers to reason about their systems, identify bottlenecks, and gain vital information for performanc...|$|R

This study reveals a complex history of lineage diversification within species of amphibians and proposes hypotheses to explain the biogeographical patterns observed. The mountains of northern Mozambique are in the crossroads between two faunal groups, Afrotemperate and Afrotropical, which partially explain the complexity of this regions biota. Most of the species found on these mountains are biogeographically related to the lowland forest of East Africa, though some strictly montane species are also present. Furthermore, this thesis provides predictions regarding species potential distributions across other unexplored mountains of this region. Some of the hypotheses and predictions presented in this thesis can potentially be tested in the future.

I would then play it back {{and then she would}} say, 'Yea, that's good' so it instantly becomes this partnership where eventually she'll have a melody and then the melody would prompt her to start thinking about this feeling she wants to put into words. This would eventually become the theme of the song." [...] —Afanasieff, on his songwriting partnership with Carey. During early 1993, Carey began working on her third studio album, Music Box. After Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey and Columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound, in order to appeal to a wider audience. During Carey's writing sessions, she began working mostly with Afanasieff, with whom she co-wrote and produced most of Music Box. On August 31, Music Box was released around the world, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200. The album was met with mixed reception from music critics; while many praised the album's pop influence and strong content, others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range. Ron Wynn from AllMusic described Carey's different form of singing on the album: [...] "It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach, but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion." [...] The album's second single, [...] "Hero," [...] would eventually come to be one of Carey's most popular and inspirational songs of her career. The song became Carey's eighth chart topper in the United States, and began expanding Carey's popularity throughout Europe. With the release of the album's third single, Carey achieved several career milestones. Her cover of Badfinger's [...] "Without You" [...] became her first number one single in Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.|$|R

5000|$|Before {{working on}} the song's {{individual}} elements, Ferraro converted the recording sessions from a generic digital audio workstation system to her programme of choice, Pro Tools. Following this, she decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland's vocals. [...] "Frédéric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards, so I did not change very much. I just did some standard things, with EQ and compression and things like that. After that my obsession {{was to get the}} vocals to sound as good as possible. When I'm mixing a track, I want something to happen, something that takes the listener somewhere. You want the right things in the right place, but it's not a technical issue. It's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place - the mixing has to be magic. It was not difficult in this case, because I knew the song would be a hit, but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical, like an angel singing, so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious. I {{wanted to make sure that}} the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn't lose you." [...] Ferraro told Sound On Sound that she did <b>add</b> <b>a</b> bass drum sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. [...] "Rather than equalise it, I <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger". However she did alter the two piano elements of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, strings and guitar samples. She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which [...] "were extensively processed", including equalization and de-essing. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, 24-bit/44.1 kHz. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low synths.|$|R
