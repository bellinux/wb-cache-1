50|$|Sumatriptan is {{administered}} in several forms: tablets, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray. Oral administration (as a succinate) suffers from poor bioavailability, {{partly due to}} presystemic metabolism—some of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target arteries. A new rapid-release tablet formulation has the same bioavailability, but the maximum concentration is achieved on average 10-15 minutes earlier. When injected, sumatriptan is faster-acting (usually within 10 minutes), but the effect lasts for a shorter time. Sumatriptan is metabolised primarily by monoamine oxidase A into an indole acetic acid <b>analogue,</b> <b>part</b> of which is further conjugated with glucuronic acid. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile. Only about 3% of the active drug may be recovered unchanged.|$|E

The motherboard was marked as TK90X. The unit had a few difference in the ROM that made the TK95 more compatible with the original ZX Spectrum. It used the same ULA chip, with only digital logic ports and the <b>analogue</b> <b>part</b> outside the ULA chip, exactly as in the TK90X. It was reported that the TK95 provided more compatibility with the original ZX Spectrum (e.g., the game Mikie runs only on the TK95, not on the TK90X), e.g., the D1 diode was disconnected and some changes to the ROM were made. Curiously, some games became incompatible due to this modification. TK90X users in Brazil used to make a switch to choose the original TK90X (or TK95) ROM or the ZX Spectrum ROM internally, so they could use almost all of the Spectrum's software.|$|E

Requirement of the front-end are derived and a topology study is performed, both from an analogue as a digital perspective. Simulations {{are carried out}} to confirm the findings. This master project was initiated by Bruco B. V., and deals with a feasibility study of a low-cost spectrum analyser front-end. Market research shows a demand for low-cost spectrum analysis for various applications, where moderate specifications compared to commercial available spectrum analysers can be acceptable. The aim is to design a spectrum analyser system with a maximum degree of integration, since this provides large cost-savings and a competitive product.
