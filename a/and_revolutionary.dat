5|$|Inspired by Georgi Sava Rakovski's revolutionary ideas, Levski {{left for}} the Serbian capital Belgrade {{during the spring of}} 1862. In Belgrade, Rakovski had been {{assembling}} the First Bulgarian Legion, a military detachment formed by Bulgarian volunteers <b>and</b> <b>revolutionary</b> workers seeking the overthrow of Ottoman rule. Abandoning his service as a monk, Levski enlisted as a volunteer. At the time, relations between the Serbs and their Ottoman suzerains were tense. During the Battle of Belgrade in which Turkish forces entered the city, Levski and the Legion distinguished themselves in repelling them.|$|E
5|$|Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly {{attracted}} by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists {{a great number of}} locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India <b>and</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices.|$|E

Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky.

5|$|Thomas Newman, who had {{previously}} worked with Sam Mendes as composer for American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead <b>and</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Road, replaced David Arnold as composer, becoming the ninth composer in the series' history. When asked about the circumstances surrounding his departure from the role, David Arnold commented that Newman had been selected by Mendes because of their work together, rather than because of Arnold's commitment to working with director Danny Boyle as composer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The soundtrack album was released on 29 October 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 6 November 2012 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1913, {{the party}} {{established}} contact with prominent revolutionaries in India, including Rash Behari Bose. An Indian edition of the Hindustan Ghadar essentially espoused the philosophies of anarchism <b>and</b> <b>revolutionary</b> terrorism against British interests in India. Political discontent and violence mounted in Punjab, and Ghadarite publications that reached Bombay from California were deemed seditious and banned by the Raj. These events, compounded by evidence of prior Ghadarite incitement in the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy of 1912, led the British government to pressure the American State Department to suppress Indian revolutionary activities and Ghadarite literature, which emanated mostly from San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Emden won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for {{excellent}} gunnery in the East Asia Squadron. In early December, Emden steamed to Incheon {{to assist}} the grounded German steamer Deike Rickmers. In May 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Karl von Müller became the ship's commanding officer; he was shortly thereafter promoted to Fregattenkapitän (Commander). In mid-June, Emden went on a cruise to the German colonies in the Central Pacific, after which she was stationed off Nanjing, as fighting between Qing <b>and</b> <b>revolutionary</b> forces raged there. During this period, on 26 August, rebels attacked the ship, and Emdens gunners immediately returned fire, silencing her attackers. Emden moved to Shanghai on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{internal}} {{tensions and}} economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount <b>and</b> <b>revolutionary</b> sympathies grew. After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the Crimea where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates. As a commoner, Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news of the outside. On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, Tikhon of Zadonsk. Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles because his father was a commoner.|$|E

After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga traveled to the Crimea by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister Grand Duchess Xenia. They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12miles (19km) from Yalta, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces. On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment. He was named after Tikhon of Zadonsk, the Saint venerated near the Grand Duchess's estate at Olgino. Although Tikhon was the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, neither he nor his younger brother Guri received any title as his father was a commoner.|$|E

5|$|In Serbia, the {{government}} was again favourable towards the Bulgarian revolutionaries' aspirations and allowed them to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion, an organisation similar to its predecessor and its goals. Levski was a prominent member of the Legion, but between February and April 1868 he suffered from a gastric condition that required surgery. Bedridden, he could {{not participate in the}} Legion's training. After the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure, Levski attempted to reunite with his compatriots, but was arrested in Zaječar and briefly imprisoned. Upon his release he went to Romania, where Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha were mobilising revolutionary detachments. For various reasons, including his stomach problems and strategic differences, Levski did not participate. In the winter of 1868, he became acquainted with poet <b>and</b> <b>revolutionary</b> Hristo Botev and lived with him in an abandoned windmill near Bucharest.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Austrian Netherlands themselves, {{the lawyers}} Jan Frans Vonck and Verlooy formed a secret society called Pro Aris et Focis in April or May 1790 {{in order to}} plan for an armed {{uprising}} against Austrian rule. Weapons <b>and</b> <b>revolutionary</b> tracts were distributed. Most {{of the members of}} the organisation came from the liberal professions (such as lawyers, writers and merchants). Most were moderates who did not object to Joseph II's reforms in principle but because they had been levied on the territories without consultation. They were supported financially by the clergy. Initially members of the opposition were divided on how the uprising should occur. Unlike Van der Noot, Vonck believed that Belgium should liberate itself rather than rely on foreign aid.|$|E
