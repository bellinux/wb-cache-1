40|$|Objectives: Illegal {{drug use}} {{continues}} to be a major threat to community health and safety. We used international drug surveillance databases to assess the relationship between multiple long-term estimates of illegal drug price and purity. Design: We systematically searched for longitudinal measures of illegal drug supply indicators to assess the long-term impact of enforcement-based supply reduction interventions. Setting: Data from identified illegal drug surveillance systems were analysed using an a priori defined protocol in which we sought to present annual estimates beginning in 1990. Data were then subjected to trend analyses. Main outcome measures: Data were obtained from government surveillance systems <b>assessing</b> <b>price,</b> purity and/or seizure quantities of illegal drugs; systems with at least 10 years of longitudinal data <b>assessing</b> <b>price,</b> purity/potency or seizures were included.

Attachment value is defined as the estimated or assigned worth of a socio-emotional good that binds one person or group to a physical object. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine if a differential exists between the market or assessed farmland price and the price a farmland owner would accept from a strange. Further this study aims to determine if attachment value has an affect on this differential. Qualitative evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that attachment value to farmland affects the WTA and that variables such as length of ownership tenure, family closeness, and community closeness affect the level of attachment value. The quantitative results provide evidence that there is a significant differential between the WTA and the <b>assessed</b> <b>price</b> and further that family closeness and education levels are significant in explaining the differential. An alternative survey instrument to more effectively explore the issue of farmland values and attachment values is presented in appendix 1. Land Economics/Use,...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Antiretrovirals are {{available}} at low prices in sub-Saharan Africa, but these prices may not be consistently available for middle-income countries in other regions with large HIV epidemics. Over 30 % of HIV infected people live in countries outside sub-Saharan Africa. Several key antiretrovirals are still on patent, with generic production restricted. We <b>assessed</b> <b>price</b> variations for key antiretroviral drugs inside versus outside sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: HIV drug prices used in national programmes (2010 – 2014) were extracted from the WHO Global Price Reporting Mechanism database for all reporting middle-income countries as classified by the World Bank. Treatment costs (branded and generic) were compared for countries inside sub-Saharan Africa versus those outside. Five key second-line antiretrovirals were analysed: abacavir, atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, raltegravir. Results: Prices of branded antiretrovirals were significantly higher outside sub-Saharan Africa (p< 0. 001, adjusted for year of purchase) (see Table 1). For example, the median (interquartile range) price of darunavir from Janssen was $ 732 (IQR $ 732 - 806) per person-year in sub-Saharan Africa versus $ 4689 (IQR $ 4075 - 5717) in non-African middle-income countries, an increase of 541 %. However, when supplied by generic companies, most antiretrovirals were similarly priced between countries in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions. 				 Conclusions: Pharmaceutical companies are selling antiretrovirals to non-African middle-income countries at prices 74 – 541 % higher than African countries with similar gross national incomes. However, generic companies are selling most of these drugs at similar prices across regions. Mechanisms to ensure fair pricing for patented antiretrovirals across both African and non-African middle-income countries need to be improved, to ensure sustainable treatment access...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to <b>assess</b> <b>price</b> {{linkages}} and patterns of transmission among producer and consumer markets for apple in Slovenia. Design/methodology/approach - Non-linear error correction models are applied. Non-linearities are allowed by means of threshold and multivariate local linear regression estimation techniques. Monthly prices over the period 2000 - 2011 are used in the empirical application. Findings - Both techniques provide evidence of non-linearities in price adjustments. Findings suggest that producer and consumer prices tend to increase rather than decrease. Results also indicate that parametric threshold approaches may have difficulties in adequately representing price behavior dynamics. Originality/value - The main contribution of this work to the literature relies on the fact that this is the first attempt to <b>assess</b> vertical <b>price</b> transmission in the apple sector in Central and Eastern European Country markets.
