5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E
5|$|On August24, {{satellite}} imagery indicated a hurricane with <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> eye was located over the central Pacific Ocean. It slowly weakened {{as it moved}} over lukewarm waters, and deteriorated more rapidly after wind shear increased. By August28, the system consisted of a circulation with only weak associated convection. It weakened to a tropical depression on August30, although it remained a tropical cyclone until September2. At {{that time it was}} last observed about 200mi (320km) south of Hilo, Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are {{a little}} {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally {{used to refer to}} the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> conformation.|$|E

5|$|When McLamore and Edgarton's Burger King Corporation began a full {{franchising}} {{system in}} 1961, it {{relied on a}} regional franchising model where franchisees would purchase the right to open stores within <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> geographic region. These franchise agreements granted the company very little oversight control over its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control, store image and design and operations procedures.|$|E
5|$|A less pure form of Limousin is bred up (also {{known as}} graded up) from a base animal over <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> number of generations. A parent of each generation's progeny must be {{registered}} as a Limousin in the respective country's herd book. In the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a graded up Limousin, after three generations for females and four generations for males, is known (confusingly {{with the legal}} European definition) as purebred, which is then eligible for recording in the respective countries' herd books alongside Fullblood and French Pure Limousins. Unlike the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which allow both purebred and Full French bulls and dams {{to be used for}} grading up, in Britain grading up can only occur using Full French bulls. British graded up females when they reach fourth generation from a non-Limousin base cow can then be registered as Limousins in the British Limousin Pedigree Register. The British Limousin Pedigree Register is separate from the British Limousin Herd Book, which is reserved for animals that have complete Full French ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In turn, it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common {{with other members of}} its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or triennial. Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being of Least Concern, because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained.|$|E

5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted. In some countries there is also <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> syndrome of brainstem death. Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will {{be associated with the}} withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a {{congestion}} charge {{was introduced to}} reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent. Over {{the course of several}} years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars– a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> value.|$|E
5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight on the shoulders of the company.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 census, {{the first}} to include Dawson Creek as <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> subdivision, counted 518 residents. Its growth spurred by the {{construction}} of the Alaska Highway, the town recorded a sevenfold increase to 3,589 residents in the 1951 census. Within five years, the population doubled to 7,531. New transport links with southern British Columbia and Alberta spurred continued growth into the next decade. The population peaked in 1966 at 12,392, then declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during {{the construction of the}} nearby town of Tumbler Ridge in the early 1980s. Dawson Creek's population has remained relatively stable since then. Between 2005 and 2009, the population rose from 10,869 to 11,514, per provincial estimates.|$|E

Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E
5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR Abkhazia is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> {{geographic}} entity under the name Abkhazia. The Abkhaz people were cognizant of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did not forget that it had existed. The SSR Abkhazia would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and break away from Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E
