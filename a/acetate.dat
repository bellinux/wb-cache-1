40|$|Two {{methods for}} the difluorovinylidenation of {{carbonyl}} compounds {{have been developed}} to synthesize 1, 1 -difluoroallenes bearing various substituents. The reaction of 1 -bromo- 2, 2 -difluorovinyllithium, generated from 1, 1 -dibromo- 2, 2 -difluoroethylene and n-butyllithium, with aldehydes or ketones, and subsequent acetylation, gives 2 -bromo- 3, 3 -difluoroallylic <b>acetates.</b> Elimination of these <b>acetates</b> with n-butyllithium affords 1, 1 -difluoroallenes in high yield. 3, 3 -Difluoro- 2 -iodoallylic <b>acetates</b> are similarly prepared from aldehydes or ketones on treatment with 2, 2 -difluoro- 1 -iodovinyllithium, generated from 1, 1, 1 -trifluoro- 2 -iodoethane and lithium diisopropylamide, followed by acetylation.

40|$|Herein {{we report}} a new {{approach}} to enantiomerically enriched <b>acetates</b> using a lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis in non-aqueous media by alkaline carbonate salts. The use of sodium carbonate in the enzymatic hydrolysis with Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) of racemic <b>acetates</b> shows a large enhancement of the reactivity and selectivity of this lipase. The role of the carbonate salts, the amount {{and the nature of the}} alkaline earth metal on the efficiency of this new pathway are investigated. The enzymatic kinetic resolution of <b>acetates</b> 1 a- 9 a, by enzymatic-carbonate hydrolysis under mild conditions is described.

5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl <b>acetate</b> and cellulose <b>acetate.</b> It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E

50|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of fluorosilanes {{requires more}} forcing reagents, i.e. alkali. The alkoxysilanes (silyl ethers) {{of the type}} R3Si(OR') are slow to hydrolyze.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{cellulose}} obtained from sisal, {{which is a}} source of rapid growth, was used. Cellulose <b>acetates</b> were produced in heterogeneous medium, using acetic anhydride as esterifying agent and iodine as catalyst, to check if the procedure described in the literature for commercial cellulose also is adequate to sisal cellulose. The results indicated that iodine is an excellent catalyst to obtain sisal cellulose <b>acetates,</b> but the reaction is so fast as described in the literature when, instead of sisal, lower average molar weight cellulose (microcrystalline) is used. The crystallinity index (I(c)) of sisal cellulose <b>acetates</b> diminished compared to sisal cellulose, but there was no direct correlation between their degree of substitution (DS) and I(c). Probably acetyl groups were introduced more homogeneously along the short chains of microcrystalline cellulose, when compared to sisal cellulose, and then for microcrystalline cellulose <b>acetates</b> the Ic decreases as DS increases. Using the linear correlation that was found between degree of substitution (DS) and time reaction is possible to control the DS of sisal cellulose <b>acetates,</b> considering a large interval of degrees of substitution (0. 3 - 2. 8) ...|$|R
