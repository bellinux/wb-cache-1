We focus on <b>activity</b> <b>sheets</b> that are closely linked to coloring and shape completion. We first introduce a baseline approach based on color regions that works well for cartoon-like images and uncluttered photographs. In more complex scenes, we show how this approach can be integrated with global textural cues for increasing the level of details that can convey semantic information. A final local stage takes advantage of object recognition and scene classification techniques for selective detailing in the foreground background regions. Though the resulting approach can be deployed in a fully automatic fashion, interactivity can be a desirable feature since it allows to account for errors and, more important, increase the level of personalization. We propose three levels of interactivity, depending on the user skills. For all steps of our system and addressed <b>activity</b> <b>sheets</b> we show representative results. ...|$|R

The subject was delivered through laboratory activities and the teachers were trained to compose the Student <b>Activity</b> <b>Sheet</b> or LKS with the knowledge on fermentation that they have just received. The method that being used in this activity is lectures on the role of biotechnology and fungi in developing food sector as well as practice on nata de coco-making using bacteria inoculums Acetobacter xylinium, wine-making using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and pest controller-making using Metarrhizium anispliae as an additional program. The result shows that the learning activities have increased the comprehension on the role of biotechnology and fungi in food sector. This could be seen through the comparison between post test and pre test result. Most of the thirteen participants in the post test have an increased score. Two participants or 15. 38 % categorized as very well, seven participants or 53. 85 % as good, three participants or 23. 08 % as fair, and only one or 7. 69 % that is still lack comprehension on the subject. There are 13 Student <b>Activity</b> <b>Sheet</b> or LKS that has been composed, eleven or 84. 62 % are categorized as good and two or 15. 38 % not in line with the topic.

The result of Nata de coco fermentation in seven days incubation is not yet clear therefore need additional incubation period.
