25|$|It {{turns out}} that {{requiring}} the cancellative property in a monoid {{is not required to}} perform the Grothendieck construction – commutativity is sufficient. However, if the original monoid has an <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> then its Grothendieck group is the trivial group. Hence the homomorphism is, in general, not injective.|$|E
25|$|Some {{comparative}} mythologists think Jewish mythology <b>absorbed</b> <b>elements</b> from pagan mythology. According {{to these}} scholars, even while resisting pagan worship, the Jews willingly <b>absorbed</b> <b>elements</b> of pagan mythology.|$|R

2500|$|Mössbauer {{emission}} spectroscopy is a specialized variant of Mössbauer spectroscopy where the emitting element {{is in the}} probed sample, and the <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> is in the reference.

2500|$|When the {{incident}} x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron of an atom within the sample, {{the number of}} x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing {{a drop in the}} transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an absorption edge. Each element on the periodic table has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at synchrotrons. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids. [...] And because of the brilliance of synchrotron X-ray sources the concentration of the <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> can be as low as a few ppm.|$|E

60|$|The bright sun-shine was {{sleeping}} in a thousand places on every side of the silent and deserted wreck. The sea had subsided to such a state of utter rest, {{that it was only}} at long intervals that the huge and helpless mass on which the ark of the expectants lay was lifted from its dull quietude, to roll heavily, for a moment, in the washing waters, and then to settle lower into the greedy and <b>absorbing</b> <b>element.</b> Still the disappearance of the hull was slow, and even tedious, to those who looked forward with such impatience to its total immersion, as to the crisis of their own fortunes.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, an <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> is {{a special}} type of element of a set {{with respect to a}} binary {{operation}} on that set. The result of combining an <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> with any element of the set is the <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> itself. In semigroup theory, the <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> is called a zero element because there is no risk of confusion with other notions of zero. In this article the two notions are synonymous. An <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> may also be called an annihilating element.|$|E

He also organised the national agriculture with a collectivist system known as the Meng'an-Mouke (猛安謀克).

50|$|The most {{well known}} {{example of an}} <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> in algebra is multiplication, where any number multiplied by zero equals zero. Zero is thus an <b>absorbing</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
50|$|Absorbing {{elements}} are particularly interesting for semigroups, especially the multiplicative semigroup of a semiring. In {{the case of}} a semiring with 0, the definition of an <b>absorbing</b> <b>element</b> is sometimes relaxed so that it is not required to absorb 0; otherwise, 0 would be the only <b>absorbing</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, at {{the same}} time as Western fashion was <b>absorbing</b> <b>elements</b> of Indian dress, Indian fashion also began to {{actively}} <b>absorb</b> <b>elements</b> of Western dress. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Western designers enthusiastically incorporated traditional Indian crafts, textiles and techniques in their work {{at the same}} time as Indian designers allowed the West to influence their work. By the turn of the 21st century, both Western and Indian clothing had intermingled creating a unique style of clothing for the typical urban Indian population. Women started wearing more comfortable clothing and exposure to international fashion led to a fusion of western and Indian styles of clothing. Following the economic liberalisation, more jobs opened up, and created a demand for formal wear. While women have the choice to wear either Western or traditional dress to work, most Indian multinational companies insist that male employees wear Western dress.|$|R
