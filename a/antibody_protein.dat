5000|$|Lysates {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, and one must assume that some amount of non-specific binding to the IP <b>antibody,</b> <b>Protein</b> A/G or the beaded support will occur and negatively affect {{the detection of}} the immunoprecipitated target(s). In most cases, preclearing the lysate {{at the start of}} each immunoprecipitation experiment (see step 2 in the [...] "protocol" [...] section below) is a way to remove potentially reactive components from the cell lysate prior to the immunoprecipitation to prevent the non-specific binding of these components to the IP beads or antibody. The basic preclearing procedure is described below, wherein the lysate is incubated with beads alone, which are then removed and discarded prior to the immunoprecipitation [...] This approach, though, does not account for non-specific binding to the IP antibody, which can be considerable. Therefore, an alternative method of preclearing is to incubate the protein mixture with exactly the same components that will be used in the immunoprecipitation, except that a non-target, irrelevant antibody of the same antibody subclass as the IP antibody is used instead of the IP antibody itself. This approach attempts to use as close to the exact IP conditions and components as the actual immunoprecipitation to remove any non-specific cell constituent without capturing the target protein (unless, of course, the target protein non-specifically binds to some other IP component, which should be properly controlled for by analyzing the discarded beads used to preclear the lysate). The target protein can then be immunoprecipitated with the reduced risk of non-specific binding interfering with data interpretation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} method for {{producing}} protein arrays on antifouling PEO-like coatings using a “non-contact” atmospheric pressure helium microplasma array. ToF-SIMS characterization of PEO-like coatings after short plasma treatment revealed the antifouling plasma polymer was largely modified/removed within the microplasma-exposed regions. Incubation of microplasma-patterned PEO-like coatings with a fluorescently labeled streptavidin resulted in selective and uniform protein adsorption within the modified regions. A protein sensing application was demonstrated where a target red fluorescent protein (RFP) was only captured on the anti-RFP functionalized regions. This indicates the adsorbed <b>antibody</b> <b>protein</b> on the microplasma-treated PEO-like regions retained its bioactivity. ...|$|E
