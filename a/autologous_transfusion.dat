40|$|Objective: Our {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of intraoperative <b>autologous</b> blood <b>transfusion</b> during laparoscopic surgery for hemoperitoneum in benign gynecologic disease. Methods: The Cell Saver, Haemo Lite 2, an intraoperative autologous blood salvage device, was used in laparoscopic surgery on 18 patients with ectopic pregnancies or ovarian bleeding who had a large hemoperitoneum with/without severe anemia and hypovolemic shock. Results: The blood loss was 1186 ± 789 mL, and the volume of reinfused processed blood was 661 ± 405 mL in ectopic pregnancy cases. The blood loss was 716 ± 219 mL, and the volume of reinfused processed blood was 496 ± 138 mL in ovarian bleeding. Laparoscopic surgery was performed and homologous blood transfusion was not required in any patient. No adverse reactions or procedural difficulties associated with the <b>autologous</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> occurred.

5000|$|Contemporary {{usage of}} the term bloodless surgery refers to both {{invasive}} and noninvasive medical techniques and protocols, and the phrase itself is somewhat confusing.

Champions of bloodless surgery do, however, transfuse products made from allogeneic blood and they also make use of pre-donated blood for <b>autologous</b> <b>transfusion.</b> Interest in bloodless surgery has arisen for several reasons.

50|$|Blood transfusions can be {{traditionally}} {{classified as}} autologous, where the blood donor and transfusion recipient are the same, or as allogeneic/homologous, where {{the blood is}} transfused into someone other than the donor. Blood transfusion begins by the withdrawal of 1 to 4 units of blood (1 unit = 450 ml of blood) several weeks before competition. The blood is centrifuged, the plasma components are immediately reinfused, and the corpuscular elements, principally red blood cells (RBCs), are stored refrigerated at 4 °C or frozen at −80 °C. As blood stored by refrigeration displays a steady {{decline in the number}} of RBCs, a substantial percentage, up to 40%, of the stored RBCs may not be viable. The freezing process, conversely, limits the aging of the cells, allowing the storage of the blood for up to 10 years with a 10% to 15% loss of RBCs. Stored RBCs are then reinfused, usually 1 to 7 days before a high-endurance event. As a significant amount of iron is removed by each <b>autologous</b> <b>transfusion,</b> an adequate time for recovery of not less than 3 days from the last donation, and appropriate iron supplements, are usually required for patients undergoing autologous donations. Nearly 50% of autologous donations are not used by the donor and are discarded, as current standards do not allow transfusion of these units to another patient for safety reasons.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) {{surgery is}} one of the most frequent and the most extensive procedures in orthopedic surgery, accompanied with some serious complications. Perioperative blood loss {{is one of}} the most serious losses, so it is vital to recognize and treat such losses properly. <b>Autologous</b> blood <b>transfusion</b> is the only true alternative for the allogeneic blood. The aim of this study was to to examine if <b>autologous</b> blood <b>transfusion</b> reduces usage of allogenic blood in total knee replacement surgery, as well as to examine possible effect of <b>autologous</b> blood <b>transfusion</b> on postoperative complications, recovery and hospital stay of patients after total knee replacement surgery. Methods. During the controlled, prospective, randomised study we compared two groups of patients (n = 112) with total prosthesis implanted in their knee. The group I consisted of the patients who received the transfusion of other people’s (allogeneic) blood (n = 57) and the group II of the patients whose blood was collected postoperatively and then given them [their own (autologous) blood] (n = 55). The transfusion trigger for both groups was hemoglobin level of 85 g/L. Results. In the group of patients whose blood was collected perioperatively only 9 (0. 9 %) of the patients received transfusion of allogeneic blood, as opposed to the control group in which 98. 24 % of the patients received the transfusion of allogeneic blood (p ≤ 0. 01). The patients whose blood was collected stayed in hospital for 6. 18 days, while the patients of the control group stayed 7. 67 days (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. <b>Autologous</b> blood <b>transfusion</b> is a very effective method for reducing consumption of allogenic blood and thus, indirectly for reducing all complications related to allogenic blood transfusion. There is also a positive influence on postoperative recovery after total knee replacement surgery due to the reduction of hospital stay, and indirectly on the reduction of hospital costs...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>autologous</b> <b>transfusion</b> of filtered shed blood in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Materials and Methods: A total of 42 patients with TKA (group A; without <b>autologous</b> <b>transfusion</b> in 15 patients, group B; with <b>autologous</b> <b>transfusion</b> in 27 patients) were evaluated retrospectively. The influence of autologous reinfusion of filtered blood, bleeding tendency, amount of blood drainage, rate of allogenic transfusion, and the postoperative changes of hemoglobin were analyzed. Results: Allogenic transfusion was needed in 26. 7 % (4 / 15) of group A and none of group B till postoperative 48 hours. Till postoperative 14 days, 46. 7 % (7 / 15) of group A needed allogenic transfusion while 7. 4 % (2 / 27) in group B. The average drained blood volume was 1, 197 ± 400 mL in group A and 975 ± 422 mL in group B. The average decrease of hemoglobin at postoperative 1, 7, and 14 days was 2. 9 ± 1. 5, 2. 9 ± 1. 6, and 2. 3 ± 1. 5 g/dL respectively in group A and 2. 7 ± 0. 8, 4. 0 ± 1. 0, and 2. 9 ± 1. 3 g/dL respectively in group B.

40|$|Orthognathic {{surgery is}} {{employed}} to correct orthodontic {{conditions of the}} jaw and face that cannot be easily treated through orthodontic therapy. The primary goals of orthognathic surgery involve achieving a correct bite and an aesthetic face. A massive hemorrhage may occasionally occur during surgery due to which blood transfusions may be periodically required. As the patients receiving orthognathic surgery are primarily young and healthy, allogenic transfusions should be avoided. Moreover, <b>autologous</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> are useful for preventing the risk of alloimmunization and infection by an unknown virus. <b>Autologous</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> can be performed via 3 techniques: intraoperative blood salvage, preoperative autologous blood donation, and isovolemic or hypervolemic hemodilution. Intraoperative blood salvage requires {{the presence of a}} clean surgical field, and is hence unsuitable for these surgeries.

40|$|ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND:Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is an {{uncommon}} lesion which exclusively occurs in an adolescent male. They comprise about 0. 05 % to 0. 5 % of all {{head and neck}} tumors. The surgical management of this lesion is challenging. This tumor being highly vascular {{has the potential to}} bleed torrentially during surgery. The advent of endoscopic sinus surgery has significantly modified {{the way in which the}} tumors of the nose and paranasal sinus have been managed. AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:Audit the clinical and operative data, to ascertain the role of preoperative embolization and <b>autologous</b> blood <b>transfusion.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:Clinical and operative data of all patients of JNA during the period 2008 to 2011 were included in this study. RESULTS: Complete tumor removal was obtained in all the eight cases. Seven of these cases had Stage II b and 1 had stage III b (Radkowski classification). Six cases were managed by endonasal endoscopic approach. Two cases were treated by external approach. All patients underwent super selective embolisation preoperatively 24 hour prior to surgery. The average blood loss during surgery was 362 ml+/- 176. 2 ml. All but one had received <b>autologous</b> blood <b>transfusion</b> during surgery.
