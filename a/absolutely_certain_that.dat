25|$|There are few {{mentions}} of Slindon in 1745 or 1746 and Newland can {{be found}} playing for All-England or leading his own team, usually in opposition to Colchin's team. In July 1745, he scored {{what was then a}} massive 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not <b>absolutely</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> he did this in one innings and it may have been his match total but, giving him the benefit of the doubt, it is the highest individual innings recorded during cricket's pioneering period (i.e., to 1763).|$|E
25|$|Viticulture {{in present-day}} Germany {{dates back to}} Ancient Roman times, to {{sometime}} from 70 to 270 CE/AD (Agri Decumates). In those days, the western parts of today's Germany made up the outpost of the Roman empire against the Germanic tribes {{on the other side}} of Rhine. What is generally considered Germany's oldest city, Trier, was founded as a Roman garrison and is situated directly on the river Moselle (Mosel) in the eponymous wine region. The oldest archeological finds that may indicate early German viticulture are curved pruning knives found in the vicinity of Roman garrisons, dating from the 1st century AD. However, it is not <b>absolutely</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> these knives were used for viticultural purposes. Emperor Probus, whose reign can be dated two centuries later than these knives, is generally considered the founder of German viticulture, but for solid documentation of winemaking on German soil, we must go to around 370 AD, when Ausonius of Bordeaux wrote Mosella, where he in enthusiastic terms described the steep vineyards on river Moselle.|$|E

25|$|When {{the ball}} was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack {{it and try to}} hit it away, usually with the {{intention}} of lofting it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most rudimentary and instinctive attempt to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were to the bowler's advantage. One of the greatest players of the pioneering period was Richard Newland of Slindon and Sussex. In July 1745, he scored 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not <b>absolutely</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> he did this in one innings as it may have been his match total (there is a parallel here with Small in a 1768 match). If it was one innings, it is the highest individual score recorded during the pioneering period and, for its time, was a very high score which could equate in real terms to a modern triple-century.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Army of Me", a song [...] "so menacing and inorganic-sounding" [...] that, {{according}} to The New York Times, it verges on industrial rock. It is an aggressive technopop song with elements of trip hop. Dedicated to the singer's younger brother, the song's lyrics are, according to Björk herself, [...] "about telling {{someone who is}} full of self-pity and doesn't have anything together to get a life and stand up"; as she sings: [...] "And if you complain once more/You'll meet an army of me!" [...] "Hyperballad", which incorporates a spectrum of electronic and orchestral styles, {{has been described as}} [...] "a love song penned by Aphex Twin". NME wrote that its music [...] "altered from gentle folktronica to drum and bass-tinted acid house"; an attempt to reflect the song's lyrics, which are about [...] "the art of not forgetting about yourself". In them, Björk describes living {{at the top of a}} mountain and going to a cliff at sunrise. She throws objects off the cliff while pondering her own suicide. The ritual allows her to exorcise darker thoughts and return to her partner. [...] "Hyperballad" [...] is followed by [...] "The Modern Things", a song that, in a magical realist tone, [...] "playfully posits the theory that technology has always existed, waiting in mountains for humans to catch up". Interview described it in 1995 as a [...] "spooky tune", noting [...] "the odd scratchings at the end" [...] of the track. In his 2000 book Jung and the Postmodern: The Interpretation of Realities, Christopher Hauke described this effect at the end as [...] "when a record player has reached the end of an analogue, vinyl record and the needle is stuck as the disc continues going round"; and considered this [...] "trick" [...] to be a case of postmodernism, serving as an example of [...] "the relationship between the present and past that pushes conceptualising even further by the inclusion of modern technology and its ambivalent relationship with previous forms." [...] In a startling shift in style, the big band track [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] covers a German composition made famous by Betty Hutton. It has been described as [...] "a palate-cleanser during the course of the record". The last song recorded for Post, Björk has said she decided to include it, [...] "just to make it <b>absolutely</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> the album would be as schizophrenic as possible, that every song would be a shock".|$|E
