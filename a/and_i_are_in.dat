500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Foster said, [...] "My wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> {{shock and}} truly devastated. Donna {{changed the face}} of pop culture forever. There is no doubt that music would sound {{different}} today if she had never graced us with her talent. She was a super-diva and a true superstar who never compromised when it came to her career or her family. She always did it with class, dignity, grace and zero attitude. She lived in rare air ... She was the most spectacular, considerate, constant, giving, generous and loving friend of 35 years. I am at a total loss trying to process this tragic news." ...|$|E
2500|$|After strong {{results in}} the {{preceding}} two rounds of the season, Rosenqvist spoke of his aspiration to achieve more podium finish results with Mahindra, and at this late stage of the season, was focusing more on the championship, and no longer felt like a first year driver: [...] "You {{have to try and}} take fewer risks to secure a strong result – especially with the double-headers. We have some great things coming from the team on the technical side, which is improving and both Nick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the mix with those {{at the front of the}} grid." [...] Buemi entered the race with the same perspective than he did in the past two ePrix but was aware the track's layout was made of concrete rather than the conventional asphalt used in preceding races but was ready to challenge for a points-scoring position. Di Grassi—nursing an ankle injury he sustained while playing in a charity football match at Stamford Bridge four days prior to the first race— stated that his team had the potential to draw closer to e.Dams-Renault in the championship contest in the event the German company achieved [...] "a perfect weekend".|$|E

2500|$|Following on from Martin Kemp's {{decision}} to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap {{in the autumn}} of 2001, stating, [...] "I'm not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friend's husband [...] To be honest with you, Mel's role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. I always said I'd go when I felt that the character had run her course, and I'm going to leave when my contract runs out next year [...] Martin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> very similar situations with our characters. We came in at a similar time, and now it looks like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat – new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career." [...] Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time.|$|E

2500|$|Snyder {{has also}} commented [...] "The term Beat is better {{used for a}} smaller group of writers ... the {{immediate}} group around Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, plus Gregory Corso and a few others.
