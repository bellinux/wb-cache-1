However, many accipitrids {{of almost all}} sizes have been {{recorded}} as capturing and then flying with prey of equal weight or even slightly heavier than themselves in their talons, a feat that requires great physical strength.

But this generalization is breached, for example, in the carefully composed Bulkhead Brace, 1913, 12 × 16 inches, which, despite both an early date and small size (most often associated, as in that work, with heavy impasto applied with a palette knife), appears fully resolved. An exception {{on the other end}} of the size range is Toward Mrs. Driscoll's, 1928, 50 × 40 inches, which is a premier coup. The impastoed paintings of 1913-1914, such as House, Mozart Avenue, 1913, and Self-Portrait, 1914, with occasional notes of fully saturated hues, are indebted to Hawthorne's teaching, but impasto, bright notes of color, and the sense of urgency in execution is still evident in paintings such as View from 46 Pearl Street, 1923, and Back of Harry Campbell's Studio, 1924. Dickinson continued the use of a palette knife, even in the large paintings, but gradually made greater use of brushes, thinner paint. In 1938 he wrote from France that many of the paintings he did then were painted [...] "with the hand only." [...] This practice continued in his later paintings. Denver Lindley, a student of Dickinson in the mid-1950s, said [...] "His favorite tool was the little finger of his right hand.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of physical activity}} for individuaI well-being has often been underlined in literature, in particular for adolescents (e. g. Fox, 1997). This work examines within the discrepancy and domain-importance approaches (e. g.

A sample of 397 adolescents balanced for gender and aged 14 - 16, completed the subsequent instruments concerning physical self-esteem predictors connected with appearance: 1) A modified form ofthe Appearance Scale of PSDQ (Marsh et aL, 1994, Meleddu et al. 2002) : Appearance Discrepancy. 2) The Global Physical Scale of PSDQ (Marsh et al., 1994, Meleddu et al. 2002) : Physical Self-Esteem. 3) The Appearance Schemas Inventory (Cash&Labarge, 1996) :Self-Investment, Vulnerability, Sterotypes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dominating farming structure in Bulgaria {{on the eve}} of EU accession, and evaluates recent policies for farm and agricultural income support, and assesses likely consequences of CAP implementation on farming structures and sustainability. We demonstrate that a specific farming structure dominates in the country consisting of numerous subsistence and small farms; and few large farms, cooperatives, and agro-firms; and widely used informal, vertically integrated, and mix forms. Public support to farming has been in an increase in recent years but is still far bellow the European level. Besides, only a fraction of farms benefit from some form of public support most of them being large farms, cooperatives, and tobacco producers. Farming is still an important income source for a good part of population. However, there is a significant gap in the monetary income in the large and some smaller- scale (intensive) enterprises, and the great majority of farms. Besides, development programs contribute less to agrarian and rural sustainability, and to decreasing divergence between richer and poor regions of the country. Assessment of likely short-term impact of the CAP implementation in Bulgaria shows that it will increase sustainability of farms bringing net financial benefits, enhancing competitiveness, and improving environmental performance. However, the chief beneficiary from the direct payments and other support measures will be the biggest farms in the most developed regions of the country. CAP programs will also give new possibility for extending activities of existing forms <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> life new organizational arrangements. All that will create more employment and income opportunities, and revitalize agrarian and rural economy. On the other hand, some effective smaller-size and family structure and livestock farms will have no or limited access to EU funding. Consequently, income and performance gap between farms of different types, sub-sectors and regions will widened unless special supplementary measures (“coupled” with production and regions) are taken. Besides, CAP will likely support “ineffective” and non-market modes (such as part-time and subsistence farming, production cooperatives), and therefore raise their sustainability and delay further restructuring. Last but not least important, there will be significant difficulties for introducing CAP and EU standards which will require more costs than in other countries, and will be associated with some time lag until “full” implementation, and would not involve less commercialized and subsistent farming. farms structures, support to farms, impact on CAP implementation on farm sustainability...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Maori activism {{across borders}} and is structured around two key themes, the creation, use {{and control of}} space, and New Zealand’s race relations reputation. It is set {{against a backdrop of}} global currents, events and ideologies which entered New Zealand and stimulated Maori activism. The overarching argument in this thesis is that Maori activists progressively created a space for themselves internationally in a variety of venues, to have their claims, grievances and realities accepted. To do so they had to subvert and challenge the discourse which confined and defined them as a privileged indigenous people who lived in a position of equality with Pakeha in a country reputed to have the best race relations in the world. I argue that the ‘privilege’ discourse shaped the form which their activism took and how, in the process of successfully contesting that discourse, they created a space for Maori in an emerging indigenous people’s activist network. A key purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the importance of New Zealand’s good race relations reputation as a determinant of both government policy and Maori actions. I demonstrate the lengths that the New Zealand government went to in order to maintain an image of ‘one people’. Threading through the thesis are the actions of the government in restricting or mediating space in order to stifle any oppositional discourse and present a positive image of race relations. Alongside this is the agency and actions of Maori {{and the ways in which}} they subverted the dominant race relations discourse and created space for an oppositional narrative, first in New Zealand and then internationally. While Maori agency played a major role in this process, they were also the beneficiaries of a global shift which prioritised the elimination of racial discrimination, the liberation of colonised peoples, and saw a growing recognition of the oppression of indigenous people and the abrogation of their rights. All played a role in opening up a space for Maori activists to use and take their claims into international forums including the United Nations, the World Council of Indigenous Peoples, and the Russell Tribunal. This thesis demonstrates the centrality of racial discrimination in opening up New Zealand to international scrutiny, and national discussion. Through an examination of three key events in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s I argue that this raised a political awareness and politicised many Maori which was reflected in a less accommodating attitude, growing unrest and discontent. Race relations shifted to a central position in New Zealand. Discontent was exacerbated by proposals designed to accelerate integration <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> satisfactory close the 'one people' imperative. It played a part in the emergence of radical Maori activism. Internationally, the opposite occurred and for much of the 1960 s New Zealand’s reputation was enhanced. From this contact was made with indigenous people who came into New Zealand to study race relations and New Zealand’s integration policies. With this came identification between Maori and indigenous peoples, understandings of similar historical and contemporary experiences, and a similar world-view. At the same time Maori began moving out across borders and making contact with indigenous people and communities. It was a soft activism and it can be seen as the first stage of awareness of each other and their place within an indigenous world. Finally, this thesis demonstrates the movement of radical Maori activists into a variety of international spaces and venues. It sheds light on how they used international spaces, the geographic extent of their activism, and the shift from mainly single issue events into an emerging independence movement across the Pacific. Thus they became part of a large network of indigenous activists who came together at conferences, and provide support and solidarity at protest actions. Moderate Maori activists moved along a different route which took them into the first transnational pan-indigenous organisation with a global perspective, the World Council of Indigenous Peoples. Collectively, as a result of these actions, Maori activists created a variety of spaces in New Zealand and internationally where they gained recognition for their grievances. Moreover they played a significant role in creating and sustaining organisations which advocated on behalf of indigenous peoples...|$|E
