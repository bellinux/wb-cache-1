5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character <b>and</b> <b>good</b> or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage <b>and</b> <b>good</b> luck.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review {{the merits of the}} decision and conclude whether Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to public order, it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with the view that the existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to public peace, welfare <b>and</b> <b>good</b> order. The judge also remarked that notion of public peace, welfare <b>and</b> <b>good</b> order in the SA was similar to the concept of public order envisaged by Article 15(4) of the Constitution.
