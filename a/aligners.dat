25|$|Clear <b>aligners,</b> {{also known}} as clear-aligner treatment, are {{orthodontic}} devices that uses incremental transparent <b>aligners</b> to adjust teeth {{as an alternative to}} dental braces. They are sold under at least five brand names, including ClearCorrect, Invisalign, and Orthoclear.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence to determine {{the effectiveness of these}} clear <b>aligners.</b> Opinion is that they are likely useful for moderate front-teeth crowding. In those with teeth that are too far forward or backward, or rotated in the socket, the <b>aligners</b> are likely not as effective as conventional braces. More cases of relapse of the anterior teeth have been found with clear <b>aligners</b> compared with conventional braces. A 2013 Cochrane review found no high-quality evidence with respect to the management of the recurrence of lower-front-teeth misalignment following treatment.|$|E
25|$|The Invisalign Express 10, {{which uses}} 10 <b>aligners,</b> was {{introduced}} in 2005. Invisalign 1.5 was released in 2009. It was followed by Invisalign G3 in 2010 and G4 in 2011. Invisalign G3 and G4 were designed for more complex treatments. An Invisalign Express 5 version, which uses 5 <b>aligners,</b> {{was introduced in}} 2012. In February 2014, Align Technology released a G5 product designed to treat deep bites.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{tools for}} {{aligning}} short DNA reads {{have been designed}} to optimize the trade-off between correctness and speed. This paper introduces a method for assigning a set of short DNA reads to a reference genome, under Local Rank Distance (LRD). The rank-based <b>aligner</b> proposed in this work aims to improve correctness over speed. However, some indexing strategies to speed up the <b>aligner</b> are also investigated. The LRD <b>aligner</b> is improved in terms of speed by storing [Formula: see text]-mer positions in a hash table for each read. Another improvement, that produces an approximate LRD <b>aligner,</b> is to consider only the positions in the reference that are likely to represent a good positional match of the read. The proposed <b>aligner</b> is evaluated and compared to other state of the art alignment tools in several experiments. A set of experiments are conducted to determine the precision and the recall of the proposed <b>aligner,</b> in the presence of contaminated reads. In another set of experiments, the proposed <b>aligner</b> is used to find the order, the family, or the species of a new (or unknown) organism, given only a set of short Next-Generation Sequencing DNA reads. The empirical results show that the <b>aligner</b> proposed in this work is highly accurate from a biological point of view. Compared to the other evaluated tools, the LRD <b>aligner</b> has the important advantage of being very accurate even for a very low base coverage. Thus, the LRD <b>aligner</b> can be considered as a good alternative to standard alignment tools, especially when the accuracy of the <b>aligner</b> is of high importance. Source code and UNIX binaries of the <b>aligner</b> are freely available for future development and use at [URL] The software is implemented in C++ and Java, being supported on UNIX and MS Windows...|$|R

30|$|Clear <b>aligner</b> {{treatment}} {{offers several}} advantages, but the available literature shows {{that some kind}} of tooth movements are unpredictable. In addition, the majority of the studies are focused on one clear <b>aligner</b> system, while different characteristics of various systems can provide different treatment outcomes. The aim of the present retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the predictability of Nuvola® <b>aligner</b> system in achieving torque movements of anterior teeth.|$|R

25|$|ClearCorrect {{was founded}} in Houston, Texas, by Willis Pumphrey, Jr., a dentist. In 2001, Pumphrey started using Invisalign. He decided to switch to OrthoClear, {{because of the way}} OrthoClear {{manufactured}} its <b>aligners</b> and because of its reduced lab fees. When manufacture of Orthoclear ceased, Pumphrey had 400 patients in treatment. With no other options available, he started his own company to complete his patients' clear aligner treatment.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method to align words in a bitext that {{combines}} elements of a traditional statistical approach with linguistic knowledge. We demonstrate this approach for Arabic-English, using an alignment lexicon produced by a statistical word <b>aligner,</b> as well as linguistic resources ranging from an English parser to heuristic alignment rules for function words. These linguistic heuristics have been generalized from a development corpus of 100 parallel sentences. Our <b>aligner,</b> UALIGN, outperforms both the commonly used GIZA++ <b>aligner</b> and the state-of-theart LEAF <b>aligner</b> on F-measure and produces superior scores in end-to-end statistical machine translation, + 1. 3 BLEU points over GIZA++, and + 0. 7 over LEAF. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{counts of}} S. sanguinis were {{significantly}} higher among bracket patients compared to those among <b>aligner</b> patients both at baseline and through orthodontic treatment (Table  5). Regression analysis indicated that <b>aligner</b> patients had significantly lower counts of S. sanguinis than bracket patients (Table  6). Additionally, there was {{a variation in the}} S. sanguinis counts during the observation period of T 0 to T 2, with a tendency to differ between <b>aligner</b> and bracket patients (P for interaction[*]=[*] 0.11). This was further explored by stratified analyses (Appendix) and indicated a variation pattern of S. sanguinis that was similar to that of s-PlI: the S. sanguinis counts showed a tendency to reduce through time among the <b>aligner</b> patients, while S. sanguinis counts tended to increase through time among the bracket patients.|$|R
25|$|Clear-aligner {{treatment}} {{involves an}} orthodontist or dentist, or with home-based systems, the person themselves, taking a mold of the patient's teeth, {{which is used}} to create a digital tooth scan. The computerized model suggests stages between the current and desired teeth positions, and <b>aligners</b> are created for each stage. Each aligner is worn for 20 hours a day for two weeks. These slowly move the teeth into the position agreed between the orthodonist/dentist and the patient. The average treatment time is 13.5 months.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} link {{sequence}} read abundance to {{expression of a}} particular gene, transcript sequences are aligned to a reference genome, or de novo aligned to one another if no reference is available. The key challenges for alignment software include sufficient speed to permit billions of short sequences to be aligned in a meaningful timeframe, flexibility to recognise and deal with intron splicing of eukaryotic mRNA, and correct assignment of reads that map to multiple locations. Software advances have greatly addressed these issues, and increases in sequencing read length are further reducing multimapping reads. A list of currently available high-throughput sequence <b>aligners</b> is maintained by the EBI.|$|E
25|$|Alignment {{of primary}} {{transcript}} mRNA sequences derived from eukaryotes to a reference genome requires specialised handling of intron sequences, which are absent from mature mRNA. Short read <b>aligners</b> perform an additional round of alignments {{specifically designed to}} identify splice junctions, informed by canonical splice site sequences and known intron splice site information. Identification of intron splice junctions prevents reads being misaligned across splice junctions or erroneously discarded, allowing more reads to be aligned to the reference genome and improving the accuracy of gene expression estimates. Since gene regulation may occur at the mRNA isoform level, splice-aware alignments also permit detection of isoform abundance changes {{that would otherwise be}} lost in a bulked analysis.|$|E

40|$|Mask <b>aligner</b> {{lithography}} is {{a well-established}} back-end fabrication process in microlithography. Within {{the last few}} years, resolution enhancement techniques have been transferred and adapted from projection lithography to further develop mask <b>aligner</b> lithography, especially concerning achievable resolution. Nonetheless, current technology using a mercury vapor lamp as a light source has reached its limits, e. g. for high-resolution pattering. Within this paper, we present {{the extension of the}} existing mask <b>aligner</b> illumination system by replacing the mercury vapor lamp with a solid-state laser. Full-field mask <b>aligner</b> lithography is guaranteed by a rotating diffuser expanding the laser beam and minimizing undesired speckle effects. An additional integrated galvanometer scanner allows a flexible choice of arbitrary angular spectrum distributions of the photomask illumination. We show versatile results like simple binary patterns of squares and triangles, as well as a more complex lateral shape like a blazed grating...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 - Schematic {{explanation}} of aligned rendering of name usages in hierarchies on screen. Name usages in three tree diagrams representing hierarchies, h 1, h 2 and h 3 are {{aligned with the}} aid of an <b>aligner</b> tree. Capital letters in hierarchies represent name usages in each hierarchy. The <b>aligner</b> tree is composed from hierarchies as a kind of superset where letters in the <b>aligner</b> tree are place holders to determine vertical offset of nodes. Rendering of a tree diagram in two dimensions based on the folder metaphor requires calculation of node position where horizontal offset depends on depth of the node while vertical offset is relevant to both depth and width. Nodes in hierarchy diagrams can be aligned horizontally by sharing the calculation of vertical offset of nodes. For example, vertical position of node C in hierarchy diagram h 1 is determined by vertical offset of node C of the <b>aligner</b> tree while horizontal offset is determined in the diagram h 1 alone. Inconsistency between hierarchies results in duplicated nodes in the <b>aligner</b> tree; different assignments of name usage S in hierarchies h 2 and h 3 results in two S nodes in the <b>aligner</b> tree. Vertical offset of nodes S in hierarchies h 2 and h 3 are determined by position of corresponding nodes S in the <b>aligner</b> tree. Missing name usages, e. g. name usages B and S in hierarchy h 1, result in vacancies in the hierarchy diagrams like vacancy for boundary sets of Rough set representation. Note that such vacancies do not affect the horizontal offset in hierarchy diagrams...|$|R

5000|$|Progressive, clear {{removable}} <b>aligners</b> (examples {{of which}} are Invisalign, Originator, and ClearCorrect) {{may be used to}} gradually move teeth into their final positions. <b>Aligners</b> are generally not used for complex orthodontic cases, such as when extractions, jaw surgery, or palate expansion are necessary. These braces are the most recent type of braces. Many orthodontists do not use these braces because they feel they do not produce the best corrective results compared to traditional braces, but opinions vary from person to person. This technique works by only tilting or rotating the teeth (including the roots), whereas traditional braces can parallel shift the whole tooth (including the roots). The braces are hardly noticeable on the teeth and work to gradually move the teeth into their right position without the need for wires or tightening. Like traditional braces, they do require an improvement in the amount of oral hygiene because they have to be removed to eat and one must brush and floss after every meal. Instead of using the traditional method where metal or clear braces were mounted for long periods of time, each set of <b>aligners</b> is worn for about 2 weeks, and they are removed to eat, drink, brush and floss. As the <b>aligners</b> are replaced every 2 weeks, the teeth are forced to move to fit the new mold.
