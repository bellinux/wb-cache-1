50|$|There was {{a problem}} {{including}} traditional built in lugs with the new stainless steel Amphibia case, so for the first case design, model 350, fixed lugs were added on. Later versions included <b>attached</b> <b>lugs</b> that swung before they incorporated integral lugs to the case. Later model cases include the integral lug model (420), the hexagon case, the ministry case (710), and the new curvy 060, and the tonneau/paddle model.|$|R
5000|$|CLX—(2008) Carbon monocoque; rear {{triangle}} is molded {{separately from}} the front, and <b>attached</b> via bonded <b>lugs</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The engine {{incorporated}} {{an integral}} tubular mounting frame which was <b>attached</b> by six <b>lugs</b> {{to the rear}} bulkhead of the missile airframe, the complete engine being enclosed in a tube-shaped fairing with the nozzles at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Dedicated motor {{mounting}} lugs, cast {{into the rear}} of the pillar, standardize the position of the motor bracket. A decade later, motor designs will settle down into a side-mounted motor that <b>attaches</b> to these <b>lugs</b> using an L-shaped bracket.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A solar micro-inverter in {{the process}} of being installed. The ground wire is <b>attached</b> to the <b>lug</b> and the panel's DC {{connections}} are attached to the cables on the lower right. The AC parallel trunk cable runs at the top (just visible).|$|R
50|$|The Type 99's bayonet was in {{the form}} of a very long, slender blade, grooved to reduce weight. The early models {{featured}} a hooked quillion. These bayonets <b>attached</b> to a <b>lug</b> under the barrel and were further stabilized by a loop that fit around the muzzle. Unmounted, it handled like a machete.|$|R
50|$|F88 GLA: The F88 GLA Austeyr variant {{is for the}} Australian Army with an M203 grenade launcher. It {{features}} an Inter-bar (armourer attached) interface, an RM Equipment M203PI grenade launcher, and a Knight's Armament quadrant sight assembly to which a Firepoint red dot sight is <b>attached.</b> The bayonet <b>lug</b> and forward vertical grip are not present in this model.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1968 and 1969 model years only, BMW {{exported}} {{into the}} United States three [...] "US" [...] models. These were the R50US, the R60US, and the R69US. On these motorcycles, {{there were no}} sidecar <b>lugs</b> <b>attached</b> to the frame and the front forks were telescopic forks, which were later used worldwide on the slash-5 series of 1970 through 1973. Earles-fork models were sold simultaneously in the United States as buyers had their choice of front suspensions.|$|R
50|$|Sights & Optics: For iron sights, the SAM-R {{uses the}} KAC 600-Meter flip-up rear sight. The first SAM-Rs used a custom Quantico-built gas block with bayonet lug and Picatinny rail on top. A KAC flip-up sight was mounted on that rail. Some {{intermediate}} models used separate gas blocks and barrel <b>attached</b> bayonet <b>lugs.</b> Current rifles are built {{with a special}} KAC-made gas block that has both a flip-up sight and a bayonet lug. The issued day optic is the TS-30A2 (military designation for Leupold's Mark 4 M3 3-9 x 36 mm MR/T Illuminated riflescope) mounted with ARMS #22 high rings, the same configuration used with the Mk 12 Mod 0/1 SPR, though more recent photos indicate the four-power Marine Corps Rifle Combat Optic ACOG is also used at times. The folding front sight mentioned earlier was designed for use with the AN/PVS-22 Universal Night Sight.|$|R
50|$|Certain unique {{kinds of}} pottery and decorations define the Caborn-Welborn people as {{distinct}} from other cultures. Caborn-Welborn Decorated, Kimmswick Fabric Impressed, and Kimmswick Plain are varieties which are present in greater frequencies in Caborn-Welborn sites, and are hallmarks of the culture. Effigy jars, both of humans and animals, are also common in Caborn-Welborn sites. Some have a human or animal head and sometimes a tail attached to the rim, others are shaped into the forms of heads, with <b>attached</b> clay <b>lugs</b> to represent limbs. Caborn-Welborn Decorated, the most commonly found decorated ceramic style, is characterized by incised or punctated lines {{on the shoulders of}} the jar forms. Other less common varieties found are indicative of continuity from preceding Lower Ohio Valley cultures and contact with the wider Mississippian world, especially the Central Mississippi valley and the Oneota culture. These types include Old Town Red, O'Byam Incised/Engraved, Manly Punctate, Angel/Kincaid Negative Painted, Beckwith Incised, Barton Incised, Ranch Incised-Like, Parkin Punctate, Campbell Punctate, Walls Engraved, and Vernon Paul Applique.|$|R
50|$|The typical navaja {{manufactured}} today blends traditional styling {{with modern}} materials. Most are smaller in blade length and overall size than the navaja carried during the classical era. The majority feature stainless steel blades, stainless metal bolsters and butt caps, and horn or wood handles. Many different blade patterns are available, with hand-made (artesanal) versions commanding the highest prices. While the ratcheting carraca {{can still be}} found on some knives, most examples now use a simplified locking mechanism consisting of a <b>lug</b> <b>attached</b> to the backspring that engages a single slot machined into the blades heel.|$|R
5000|$|Internally, helmets {{up until}} the 1970s, and in certain areas the 1980s, had only a sweat band {{to allow it to}} sit {{correctly}} on the wearer's head, with a single chin strap. The helmet plate and either a [...] "cockscomb" [...] or [...] "rose top" [...] fixed {{to the top of the}} helmet, were fitted by pressing the metal <b>lugs</b> <b>attached</b> to the badges through the helmet and then having small matchstick-size pieces of wood pushed through the lugs to secure them. Other helmet furniture included a [...] "ball top" [...] and in some cases a [...] "spike top".|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, {{a revised}} four-link {{suspension}} with a Watt's linkage {{was added to}} the rear axle; while not a change to independent rear suspension, general road handling manners improved at the expense of towing capacity. Larger brakes necessitated the standardization of 16-inch wheels. Police cars (P71/P72) switched from full wheel covers and dog-dish covers held onto the wheel by four nubs (on HD Steel Wheels) to a design with center caps that <b>attached</b> onto the <b>lug</b> nuts; these were sourced from the Explorer SUV. Under the hood, coil-on-plug ignition replaced the traditional spark plug wires; a first for the 4.6 L 2v Modular V8, this was a design borrowed from the 3.4 L V8 used in the 1996-1999 Ford Taurus SHO (and the 4.6 L 4v used in the 1993-1998 Lincoln Mark VIII & 1996-1998 Mustang SVT Cobra).|$|R
50|$|Pottery of the Early Chalcolithic {{period is}} often {{similar to that}} of the Late Neolithic. One {{diagnostic}} feature of this period is found in pottery made on mats, probably of straw. When this was the case, the clay was pressed into the weave of the mat, leaving an impression which potters sometimes did not remove. Thus some bases of vessels in this period bear distinct patterns of mats on which they were made. Other techniques used for pottery production in this period include painting and slipping of exteriors, and the limited use of incised decoration, sometimes in a fish bone pattern but of usually much larger dimensions than that associated with Yarmukian pottery. One specialized form associated with this period is the so-called 'torpedo' vessel, a long narrow, thick-walled jar with two large, vertical <b>lugs</b> <b>attached</b> to its upper, almost tube-like body. Pottery of the Late Chalcolithic period sees a continuation of many of the basic shapes and types of the earlier period, but much of the typical decoration of the earlier Chalcolithic is discontinued.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of reliable spring steel in Spain, the navaja could be fitted with a tempered steel, externally mounted backspring, making the design much more useful. The new spring-back navaja proved very popular throughout Spain and was later exported to or manufactured in other countries as well, particularly France and the island of Corsica.During {{the first part of}} the 18th century, the blade heel and backspring of the navaja were cleverly altered to provide a locking device for the blade. Pulling open the blade from the handle, the lock allowed the blade to rotate into the fully open position, where it locked into position. The locking mechanism itself consisted of pinion teeth (piñones or dientes) cut into the blade heel (talón de la hoja) that are engaged by a <b>lug</b> <b>attached</b> to either the backspring or a separate spring-loaded metal latch as the knife is opened. The last pinion tooth serves to keep the blade locked in its fully opened position. The ratcheting-tooth lock-blade navaja was commonly referred to as a navaja de muelles or navaja de siete muelles. The metal-to-metal contact produces a distinctive clicking sound when the blade is opened, and the navaja de muelles was popularly termed the carraca in consequence. With its locking blade, the navaja de muelles was now a versatile fighting knife, able to safely deliver thrusts as well as slashes (cuts). The navaja de muelles proved sufficiently formidable as an offensive arm that it was specifically named by the Marqués de la Mina, the Spanish military governor of Catalonia, in his edict of 29 May 1750 prohibiting the carrying of armas blancas, or edged weapons.|$|R
2500|$|During World War II, Stevens began {{producing}} {{both the}} Model 520A (renamed the Model 520-30) and the Model 620A (labeled as the Model 620) as trench guns, riot guns, and long-barreled training guns for the US military. [...] Trench guns were produced with 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) {{and had a}} heat shield with a unique pinkish anodized bayonet <b>lug</b> <b>attached</b> {{to the front of}} the barrel (late war examples had a small [...] "S" [...] stamped on the left side).

[...] Trench guns were also fitted with a sling swivel in the stock. [...] Riot guns also had 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) and had all the same martial markings, except that all the barrel markings were on the left side. [...] The long barreled training guns were marked in the same manner as riot guns and were mainly used for aerial gunnery training. [...] Total wartime production of all Model 520-30 shotguns was 33,306 and all Model 620 shotguns was 12,174. [...] After the war the US military standardized both the Model 520-30 and the Model 620 and kept them in the inventory. [...] They were used in the Korean War and as late as the Vietnam War.|$|R
