The frontispiece is a woodcut portrait of the author, which during the printing process bled through to the next page, ruining {{more than half the}} print run so that only 170 of the 300 copies printed were deemed suitable to sell. The rest were sent to reviewers and friends.|$|E
5|$|Noé's dream {{project for}} many years, the {{production}} {{was made possible}} after the commercial success of his previous feature film, Irréversible (2002). Enter the Void was primarily financed by Wild Bunch, while Fidélité Films led the actual production. With a mix of professionals and newcomers, the film makes heavy use of imagery inspired by experimental cinema and psychedelic drug experiences. Principal photography took place on location in Tokyo, and involved many complicated crane shots. Co-producers included the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie, which also provided the computer-generated imagery. The film's soundtrack is <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> electronic pop and experimental music.|$|E
5|$|Sited {{adjacent}} to Housing and Development Board apartment {{blocks of the}} Marine Parade Housing Estate, the Marine Parade Community Building {{could be seen as}} an attempt to engage the wider community. The activities of the community building were planned to overlap and to coalesce, as a one-stop destination for the entire family. The rich congruence of the multiple programmes for the building is expressed architecturally as <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> diverse elements. The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through a multiplicity of materials and forms.|$|E

5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in frontman Sam Eastgate's bedroom in Castle Donington, England, and at several locations in London. It went through a fractured creative process that lasted {{for more than two}} years. It was eventually produced by Eastgate and DJ Erol Alkan between 2007 and 2008. Fantasy Black Channel does not contain a unifying musical or lyrical theme; rather, it is <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> all the ideas, genres, and studio effects that fascinated the band members and Alkan, especially during live recording sessions. The record was very well received by critics. It was often treated {{as one of the best}} British albums of 2008 because of its eclecticism and spirit of invention. Late of the Pier did not record any further albums following the death of drummer Ross Dawson in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} is <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> snippets from Carey's {{shows at the}} Tokyo Dome, during her Daydream World Tour in 1996. Most of the video is the {{performance}} of the song during one of the three Japanese shows on the tour. Serving as an airplay only song in the US, and a limited release around the world, the song received a well amount of chart success specifically in the U.S.. In the United States, Billboard rules did not allow the charting of non-commercially released songs. For this reason, it did not chart on the Hot 100, however peaking at number two on the Adult Contemporary chart. Outside the US, the song peaked at number 11 in Canada, 40 in New Zealand and 44 in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. <b>A</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E

25|$|During the 2nd century BCE, the Maurya Empire became <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> {{regional}} powers with overlapping boundaries.

25|$|However, many of {{the rocks}} exposed in Turkey were formed long before this process began. Turkey {{contains}} outcrops of Precambrian rocks, (more than 520 million years old; Bozkurt et al., 2000). The earliest geological history of Turkey is poorly understood, {{partly because of the}} problem of reconstructing how the region has been tectonically assembled by plate motions. Turkey {{can be thought of as}} <b>a</b> <b>collage</b> <b>of</b> different pieces (possibly terranes) of ancient continental and oceanic lithosphere stuck together by younger igneous, volcanic and sedimentary rocks.|$|E
25|$|For a February collector's edition issue, People {{magazine}} ran {{a special}} cover honoring the 50th anniversary.
