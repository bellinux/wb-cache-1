25|$|Because {{morphology}} differences cannot dictate caste {{differences in}} S. septentrionalis, due to morphological similarity, castes {{are determined by}} adult disputes as opposed to manipulation at the larval stage. In colonies with already-established queens, workers will display aggressive behavior in order to inhibit female ovary development. Females with limited ovary development exhibit stringed, filamentous ovaries {{that do not have}} a mature oocyte and cannot contain sperm. When workers are not preventing female development, they are raised in an orphanage-like manner where they are able to develop full ovaries with multiple oocytes that can maintain sperm.

500|$|Despite being literate, {{giving him}} <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a scholar, young Yue Fei chose the {{military}} path because {{there had never}} been any tradition of full-fledged Confucian civil service in his family history.
