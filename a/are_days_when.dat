500|$|There <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> themed skating is {{encouraged}}. [...] Santa attire {{was encouraged}} on Saturday, December 13, 2008, and zombie attire was encouraged the next day, {{as part of}} an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for number of zombies on ice.

The couple {{are the parents}} of six young rabbits {{generally}} called The Flopsy Bunnies. Benjamin and Flopsy are [...] "very improvident and cheerful" [...] and have some difficulty feeding their brood. At times, they turn to Peter Rabbit (who has gone into business as a florist and keeps a nursery garden), but there <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Peter cannot spare cabbages. It is then that the Flopsy Bunnies cross the field to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap of rotten vegetables.|$|E

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house â€“ even though there <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
2500|$|Later, John Buchanan, {{then the}} coach of Australia, {{admitted}} that Australia's batting did not show any application.

Sadly, we can't offer those excuses today.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{after the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{optimism}} persisted for some time. John D. Rockefeller said [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> many are discouraged. In the 93 {{years of my}} life, depressions have come and gone. Prosperity has always returned and will again." [...] The stock market turned upward in early 1930, returning to early 1929 levels by April. This was still almost 30% below the peak of September 1929.|$|E

50|$|The seventh day, {{traditionally}} {{known as}} Renri (the common person's birthday), <b>is</b> the <b>day</b> <b>when</b> everyone grows one year older.

60|$|Kells slowly became convalescent {{and then}} he had a relapse. Something happened, the nature of which Joan could not tell, and he almost died.

60|$|It is a pretty, patriarchal idea: I {{stand between}} the trusting, admiring family and these {{explosive}} stoves {{that are the}} terror of their lives.

5000|$|Tracy's failing {{health was}} {{more serious than}} most people are aware of. According to Poitier:"The illness of Spencer {{dominated}} everything. I knew his health was very poor {{and many of the}} people who knew what the situation was didn't believe we'd finish the film, that is, that Tracy would be able to finish the film. Those of us who were close knew it was worse than they thought. Kate brought him to and from the set. She worked with him on his lines. She made sure with Stanley Kramer that his hours were right for what he could do, and what he couldn't do <b>was</b> different each <b>day.</b> There <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he couldn't do anything. There <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he <b>was</b> great, and I got the chance to know what it was like working with Tracy." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{days now}} go by in moods of rapid succession.

6000|$|... "Because I can't. Now I admit I've got {{shame in}} my heart and pride in my head, and I'm strung up. I might do something--this afternoon. But it won't last. YOU--you have pride in your bones. My pride will vanish at a laugh. My honour will go at a laugh. I'm just exalted by a crisis. That's all. I'm an animal of intelligence. Soul and pride are weak in me. My mouth waters, my cheek brightens, {{at the sight of}} good things. And I've got a lickerish tail, Benham. You don't know. You don't begin to imagine. I'm secretive. But I quiver with hot and {{stirring}} desires. And I'm indolent--dirty indolent. Benham, there <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I splash my bath about without getting into it. There <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I turn back from a walk because there's a cow in the field.... But, I spare you the viler details.... And it's that makes me hate fine people and try so earnestly to persuade myself that any man is as good as any man, if not a trifle better. Because I know it isn't so...." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{some people}} call it {{religion}} and some call it cussedness, begging your pardon, Mrs. Dr. dear, for using such a word. It seems they cannot make out which it is in Harrison's case. There <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he growls at everybody because he thinks he is fore-ordained to eternal punishment. And then there <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> {{he says he does}} not care and goes and gets drunk. My own opinion is that he is not sound in his intellect, for none of that branch of the Millers were. His grandfather went out of his mind. He thought he was surrounded by big black spiders. They crawled over him and floated in the air about him. I hope I shall never go insane, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I do not think I will, because it is not a habit of the Bakers. But, if an all-wise Providence should decree it, I hope it will not take the form of big black spiders, for I loathe the animals. As for Mrs. Miller, I do not know whether she really deserves pity or not. There are some who say she just married Harrison to spite Richard Taylor, which seems to me a very peculiar reason for getting married. But then, of course, I am no judge of things matrimonial, Mrs. Dr. dear. And there is Cornelia Bryant at the gate, so I will put this blessed brown baby on his bed and get my knitting." ...|$|E
60|$|Raoul {{answered}} not {{for some}} time. His eyes were fastened {{on a bright}} star, and a tumult of thoughts began to crowd upon his brain. There are moments {{in the life of}} every man when the mental vision obtains clearer views of remote conclusions, equally in connection with the past and the future, as there <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> an atmosphere purer than common more readily gives up its objects to the physical organs--leaving the mind momentarily the master, almost without control. One of these gleams of truth passed over the faculties of the dying man, and it could not be altogether without its fruits. Raoul's soul was agitated by novel sensations.|$|E
6000|$|The 'bus that plies between New Romney and Folkestone {{is painted}} a British red and inscribed {{on either side}} with the word [...] "Tip-top" [...] in gold amidst voluptuous scrolls. It is a slow and portly 'bus. Below it swings a sort of hold, hung by chains between the wheels, and in the summer time the top has garden seats. The front over the two dauntless unhurrying horses rises in tiers like a theatre; there is first a seat for the driver and his company, and above that a seat and above that, unless my memory plays me false, a seat. There <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> this 'bus goes and days when it doesn't go--you have to find out. And so you get to New Romney.|$|E
