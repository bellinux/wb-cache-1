Communication failure simulations were run every 15 minutes using 7 days of ETMS data for the entire U. S. airspace, and using 5 days of PDARS data for New York City region.

This is indeed an emerging task when introducing security tools to ATM. The emerging challenges in the next generation ATM when looking at security still seem to be underestimated. This {{stems from the fact that}} ATM, when being addressed as a system of systems, not only gives attention to threat sources like those well-known from the cyber security area, but also to ATM specific sources like e. g. satellite communication or Air Traffic Control (<b>ATC)</b> radio <b>communication.</b> In order to establish security management tools in the ATM domain the Global ATM Security Management Project (GAMMA) started in 2013. The main goal of the project is to develop ideas to solve emerging air traffic management vulnerabilities. This intention is backed up by practical proposals for implementation. The paper will discuss a subset of the GAMMA project outcomes. This will especially deal with the Secure ATC Communications Prototype (SACom). The prototype will be used as an example to enrich the theoretical presented background with a more tangible contribution. Although the project is still on its way there have already been some first insights into the validation phase as several rehearsals already took place. These insights will be described in more detail in the paper. Furthermore the theoretically delivered security prototype validation approach will be mapped to the prototype at hand. The obtained results will be presented and a discussion of the first validation results will be executed.

This study focuses on the utterances which are delivered by the ATC controller to the pilot. There are two the objectives of the study; (1) to find out types of illocutionary act found in ATC controller utterances to pilot during the flight, (2) to investigate the syntactic realization of the illocutionary acts. This research applies qualitative approach in relation to the use of clear and systematic description about the language phenomena. Document analysis is the design of this study. The data are transcribed dialogues in Flight Simulator X between the ATC controller and the pilot. The result of the study shows that three types of illocutionary acts (expositives, behabitives, and exercitives) are applied for different purposes. Of the three types of illocutionary acts, it is found that the ATC controller realizes different illocutionary acts using declarative sentences and imperative sentences for some different purposes rather than other types of illocutionary acts. In this case, the ATC controller tends to use direct speech act to show the actions to the pilot. To get more comprehensive study of illocutionary acts, the next researchers are suggested to investigate other elements of speech act since this study focused on illocutionary acts of very formal and strict fixed instructions. The next researchers are also suggested to conduct a study on illocutionary act focusing on other communication context such as speech or religious speech to make illocutionary act study more comprehensive...|$|R

The timing between the two short messages also influenced communication. The second message interfered with memory for or response to the first short message when it was delivered too soon after the first message.

40|$|Introduction: 1. 1 The Future of the Aviation System. It {{is nothing}} if not presumptuous to look ahead twenty years in any phase of human activity. This seems {{particularly}} true in civil aviation where the certificated airlines are in the throes of transition from economic regulation to a free market system. Furthermore, while in the past forecasters could count on the number of players in the game remaining constant (subject to elimination by merger), currently new airlines are born every day, at least on paper. The friendly old aviation gang has broken up, with {{the rules of the game}} constantly changing. Thus at first glance an attempt now to predict what will happen in the future appears whimsical, if not downright foolish. However, this inquiry concerns not just the airlines, but aviation. Here that much-misused and maligned word, system, is justified. Airlines depend on many other parts: manufacturers build their aircraft, airports provide space to land them, and the air traffic control system keeps them apart. Then-there is general aviation, by some measures the largest part of the system. The flying farmer in Kansas views the big jets which occasionally appear high overhead as simply faster and more expensive Greyhounds; looking at clear and empty skies over his homestead, talk about the aviation system straining at capacity appears ludicrous. One possible approach to the future is to dissect the system and look at the components. The objection to this tack is the interrelationship of the parts if one part moves, then it affects most, if not all, of the other parts. [...] The problem is equivalent to solving a set of simultaneous equations (with possibly time-varying coefficients). For example, if some airports reach saturation, the effects on the system will appear in both the short term and the long term. In the short term, traffic may shift to other (nearby) airports; general aviation aircraft may be banned; larger aircraft may replace smaller aircraft, keeping operations almost constant while providing extra lift; or operations may simply remain at the saturation level. In the long term, more or longer runways may be added to the airports; larger and more sophisticated aircraft may be designed by the manufacturers; technological improvements in the ATC system may provide more airport and airway capacity. Furthermore, the outside world is interacting with the system and affecting its behavior. A slump in the economy leads to a downturn in travel, as fewer businessmen fly as well as fewer vacationers even the deepest discounts cannot attract the public when consumer confidence is down. [...] And in the long run, changes in lifestyles, population make-up, telecommunications, etc., alter travel patterns as well. Since the aviation system has reacted to internal and external forces over time, a plausible approach to the future is to look back and search for potential cause-effect relationships. Then, if long term trends exist inside and outside the system. and links between them are identified, pictures of the future can be drawn. These certainly will not be predictions, but rather possible evolutions of the system. Many alternative futures are possible, depending on the action taken by different persons both inside and outside the aviation system. With some luck the futures that will be presented here will seem credible, even if not highly probable, given the nature of the task. At the least, they are intended to stimulate thought about the likelihood of the outcomes they portray. Consequently, to planners concerned with aviation, they may provide guidelines for possible initiatives in research and technology. * The author would like to acknowledge the guidance and assistance of the contract monitors, Messrs Robert Letchworth and Matt Winston of NASA Langley Research Center. 1. 2 The Aviation System: Definitions and Measures The aviation system is sufficiently complex so that no single statistic can provide a comprehensive overview. However, there are measures of activity which indicate how fast the system is changing and some key variables which explain how the system functions. There are also constraints (or potential constraints) on the system (or various subsystems), and linkages between constraints and key variables. These constraints may or may not be quantifiable, such as regulatory changes, aircraft noise limitations, and airport curfews. It is possible to classify the subsystems of aviation in many ways the exact designation is not important if no major components are lost. [...] Most simply, the system can be split into the users of the system and the providers of the service. The users are general aviation and public-for-hire carriers (scheduled and unscheduled, a distinction which is gradually being blurred). The suppliers of the service are airports, airways, the ATC system, and the aerospace industry which builds the vehicles which flow over the system. More detail is provided in Figure 1. 1. Different classifications are possible. One used often (Schriever and Seifert, 1967) splits the system into air vehicle; air traffic control; and airports and terminals. Another widely used breakdown (FAA, 1967) is into air carriers, GA, fuel consumption, aircraft technology, air cargo, aviation safety and complementary and competing modes. Yet another way (CARD, 1971) is to look at the system from a mission point of view (commercial passenger service, air cargo, GA) and a system element point of view (air vehicles, ATC, airports, complementary surface transporta- tion). It is apparent that classifications and their concomitant emphases depend to a large degree on who is looking at the system and for what reason. Figure 1. 1 shows the complete system. Some parts of it will receive little analysis in this study: military components (since the emphasis is on civil aviation) and non-transportation-related GA activity. Table 1. 1 shows the key measures of activity which will be used throughout the study. Public Service General Aviation Passei Cargo The Aviation System A.

Kennedy won the debates (although this was disputed by some listeners) and the election (although some questions were raised about the decisive ballots in Chicago). The value of manned space exploration was being heatedly discussed, even as NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which itself had only been established in 1958, replacing NACA, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) tentatively selected 1970 as the year for a manned lunar landing. In the air transport system, it had been over a year since the first turbo jet had been introduced in domestic service (B 707 - 12 C, December 10, 1958), followed quickly by two other turbine-powered aircraft, the turboprop Electra (January 23, 1959) and the DC- 8 (September 18, 1959). The transition to the jet age was well under way. (cont.) By the end of 1960 the domestic airlines had in their inventory 470 turbine-powered aircraft (246 turboprops and 224 turbojets) out of a total of 1980 aircraft. The total investment by the domestic passenger carriers reached $ 1. 66 billion. For the first time DC- 3 's carried less than half of local service airline traffic. The airlines had not yet passed the combined bus-railroad intercity common carrier passenger mile total (38. 8 billion RPM, 49. 3 % of the total RPMs). In fact, in domestic travel passenger miles flown in coach were still fewer than in first-class (47. 2 % compared to 52. 8 %), but,increasingly, faster trips as well as 25 % discounts were making coach ever more attractive. However, the new era was not without its problems. In 1960, there were 0. 93 fatalities per 100 million rpm in domestic passenger service, notably the second in-flight Electra crash (which led to severe speed restrictions on the aircraft, but no grounding) and the mid-air collision between a TWA Super Constellation and a UAL DC- 8 over Brooklyn, New York. 1960 was the worst year for accidents since 1951. As a result, questions were raised about the efficiency of the FAA (Federal Aviation Agency), which had been established in 1958, almost coincidentally with the introduction of the jets. The higher speeds of the turbine-powered aircraft required faster reaction times from the ATC system if safety was not to be compromised. Additionally, flight delays, diversions, and weather cancellations were estimated to have cost the airlines $ 25 - 50 million for the year. In the economic regulation area, 1960 saw the conclusion of the four-year-old General Passenger Fare Investigation (GPFI), in which the CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) decided that a 10. 5 % return on investment would be proper for the trunks. However, a 5 % fare increase granted in June 1960 did not help the industry achieve this profit; rather, for the year profit shrank to $ 4 million (a 3. 4 % return), although gross revenues rose to $ 2 billion. Air cargo reached 920 million ton-miles, up from 350 million in 1950. While the air transport industry and general aviation were undergoing tremendous growth by practically any operational measure, complaints and apparent problems were abundant. In fact, President Kennedy established a task force ("Project Horizon") to "redefine and affirm" national aviation goals for the 1960 's. Alan Boyd, then the new Chairman of the CAB, was well aware of one of the objectives of the Board -to nurture the industry -when he reflected on the findings of the GPFI (which had noted that,while revenue growth proceeded unimpeded, profits trended downward since mid- 1955 and that the "transition to jet equipment which the industry is now undergoing has presented financial and other problems of a magnitude never before faced. " [ATA 1961]) "Today's low (airline) earnings focus attention on another of our immediate problems. Mach 3 (supersonic) is staring us in the face [...] . Carrier earnings are the only hope for a substantial private enterprise contribution to supersonic development and the nation must develop one. [...] Carrier earnings in the years immediately ahead are the only hope that a private enterprise air transport system can absorb the next equipment transition. " SST's, the need for improved earnings, and modernization of the ATC System aside, observers of the airline industry noted these additional problems facing air transportation in 1960 : 1. Overcapacity and the concomitant need for traffic to fill the seats; 2. Rising cost levels, in particular high wage costs which took up 42 % of total expenses, compared to 23 % for materials and services, 12 % for fuel and oil, and 11 % for amortization and depreciation; 3. Nascent noise problems; 4. Rising subsidy needs by local service carriers (from $ 15 million in 1950 to $ 37 million).

40|$|A fixed-base, piloted {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to determine the operational benefits that result when air traffic control (ATC) instructions are transmitted to the deck of a transport aircraft over a digital data link. The ATC instructions include altitude, airspeed, heading, radio frequency, and route assignment data. The interface between the flight deck and the data link was integrated with other subsystems of the airplane to facilitate data management. Data from the ATC instructions were distributed to the flight guidance and control system, the navigation system, and an automatically tuned communication radio. The co-pilot initiated the automation-assisted data distribution process. Digital communications and automated data distribution were compared with conventional voice radio communication and manual input of data into other subsystems of the simulated aircraft. Less time was required in the combined communication and data management process when data link <b>ATC</b> <b>communication</b> was integrated with the other subsystems. The test subjects, commercial airline pilots, provided favorable evaluations of both the digital communication and data management processes...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} whether {{expertise is}} more likely to mitigate age declines when experts rely on environmental support in a pilot/Air Traffic Control (<b>ATC)</b> <b>communication</b> task. Pilots and nonpilots listened to ATC messages that described a route through an airspace, while they referred to a chart of the airspace. They read back (repeated) each message and then answered a probe question about the route. In a preliminary study, participants could take notes while listening to the messages and performing the read-back and probe tasks. In Experiment 1, opportunity to take notes was manipulated. Note taking determined when expertise mitigated age differences on the read-back task. With note taking, read-back accuracy declined with age for nonpilots but not for pilots. Without note taking, similar age-related declines occurred for pilots and nonpilots. Benefits of expertise, younger age, and note taking occurred for probe accuracy, but mitigation did not occur. The findings suggest that older adults take advantage of a domain-relevant form of environmental support (note taking) to maintain performance on some complex tasks despite typical age-related declines in cognitive ability...|$|E

40|$|Since {{years it}} is known that radio {{communication}} used by ATC can easily be intruded and is therefore subject to recurrent attacks. Nevertheless the voice communication between pilots and controllers is still the most flexible and efficient medium especially in a busy traffic environment, in non-standard situations or simply when exchanging air-ground messages in plain language is needed. As vulnerability seems not dominant compared to the number of crucial damages, voice communication is still the basic and most important communication method within the aeronautical mobile service. This motivated the development of a prototype for secure ATC communications (SACom) within the frame of the Global ATM Security Management Project (GAMMA). The challenge when designing a security management prototype for ATM is not only {{to find out if the}} concept is appropriate to minimize the expected impact of possible attacks. In fact the benefit for the participating stakeholders has to be evaluated and proven by appropriate evidence. The need for evidence leads to the understanding that there is a clear lack existing between the theoretically defined outlines by NextGen and SESAR and the measures at hand to validate prototypes in the area of ATM security. The document highlights the approach to validate the proposed system to secure <b>ATC</b> <b>communication.</b> Therefore the paper describes the intended prototype to secure ATC voice communication and the different modules it consists of. Moreover the surrounding validation environment and the dedicated validation platform for investigating the prototype is elaborated and described in detail. To achieve this, reader’s mindset will be sharpened for the idea of validation platform subsets and validation environment building blocks Within the project the prototype for secure <b>ATC</b> <b>communication</b> has been designed and developed. The verification of the prototype has been conducted in the Air Traffic Management Validation Center of the DLR in 2015 / 2016, whereas the first validation exercises were conducted in late spring of 2016. During the exercises the benefit of each single module as the benefit of the correlated value of all indicators will be validated. The prototype is not only been verified and validated as a single system. Moreover, during the preparatory work for the validation exercises a small scale experimental setup was used together with partners in the project in order to elaborate added value of the presented prototype already as a pre-production sample. The results obtained already demonstrate the general feasibility of the developed prototype. A detailed discussion of the preliminary validation results will be done in the full paper. This research-in-progress paper presents the initial findings from the validation and initial implementation of the security management prototype for secure ATC communications. The recent work supports the current security engineering needs and offers an iteratively deployable capability to complement the current ATM/CNS system and future deployment activities under SESAR or NextGen. The applied approach for the validation of this single prototype provides a mature basis for setting up a distinct methodology for validation of other ATM security oriented systems...|$|E
40|$|Data Comm—a digital, text-based controller-pilot {{communication}} system—is {{critical to}} many NextGen improvements. With Data Comm, communication becomes a visual task. Although Data Comm brings many advantages, interacting {{with a visual}} display may yield an increase in head-down time, particularly for single-pilot operations. This study examined the feasibility of supplementing the visual Data Comm display with an auxiliary synthetic speech presentation. Thirty-two pilots flew two experimental scenarios in a Cessna 172 Flight Training Device. In one scenario, <b>ATC</b> <b>communication</b> was with a text-only Data Comm display; in the other, the text Data Comm display was supplemented with a synthetic speech display annunciating each message (i. e., text+speech). In both scenarios, pilots heard traffic with similar call signs on the party line and received a conditional clearance; however in just one scenario (counter-balanced between communication conditions), pilots received a clearance that was countermanded by a live controller before it was displayed. Results indicated that relative to the text-only display, the text+speech display aided single-pilot performance by reducing head-down time; {{and it may have}} prevented participants from acting prematurely on the conditional clearance. Supplementing text Data Comm with speech did not introduce additional complications: participants were neither more likely to erroneously respond to similar call signs, nor to ignore a live ATC voice countermand. The results suggest that the text+speech display did not hinder single-pilot performance and offered some benefits compared to the text-only display...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the full lifecycle of security countermeasures {{identified in the}} Security Risk Analysis of the future Air Traffic Management System (ATM). The process establishes new security functions identified in the GAMMA project and their implementations {{in order to ensure}} acceptable levels of security for ATM. In this project, ATM Security is addressed by focusing on two dimensions defined by Single European Sky ATM Research: establishing a collaborative support capability by defining a framework embracing three-levels for Security Management (i. e. European, National, and Local) and developing security measures for the self-protection/resilience of the ATM Systems by exploiting automated security-related functions to handle potential threats. This paper concentrates on the second dimension and how the countermeasures are identified, implemented and developed in prototypes. The prototypes will then be validated in an operational scenario, through the new concept introduced by the project. The reader will be accompanied through a practical example of the whole process on how ATM Security needs have been identified. The objective is to protect the core ATM Security functionalities (Primary Assets) and corresponding Supporting Assets. We identified 44 of the most feared threat scenarios in terms of impact on the SESAR Key Performance Areas (KPA). The threat scenario described in this paper is “False ATCO”, affecting the Supporting Asset “Voice system”. The developed prototype is “SACom” (Secure <b>ATC</b> <b>Communication)</b> that considers the security countermeasures identified in the risk treatment analysis to reduce the risks. The paper concludes with the description of the activities planned for validating the SACom prototype as part of the proposed global solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{case for}} Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is {{developing}} rapidly. Sense & Avoid {{will not be}} solved {{in the next few}} years, so that large unmanned aircraft will most likely fly in controlled airspace first, where instrument flight rules determine the flight profile and manoeuvring. In this sense, the air traffic controller is the eye of the aircraft through his radar picture. Because {{of the size of the}} airspace, these aircraft will fly Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) where Command and Control (C 2) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) are relayed over satellite. The important questions to be investigated are how to obtain adequate situation awareness for air traffic control on UAS and how to set up emergency procedures in case of loss of satellite communication. We have set up a real-time man-in-the-loop simulation environment, where real air traffic controllers, a real pilot (for other traffic), and a pilot at a UAS ground control station (GCS) participated to evaluate the concept. We tested different scenarios, ranking from only loss of <b>ATC</b> <b>communication</b> to total satellite communication failure and investigated predictability of behaviour of the unmanned aircraft, response from the air traffic controller, and response from the UAS pilot. Analysis of the radar tracks was made and interviews were held. We have shown, in a simulated environment, that integration of UAS in controlled airspace, is a feasible concept; air traffic controllers indicated that control of the UAS did not differ significantly from control of other, manned aircraft. We have also demonstrated that UAS emergency procedures can be designed equivalent to those of manned aircraft, such that the air traffic controller will understand and is able to predict the behaviour of the UAS in several loss-of-satellite-communication situations. ...|$|E
40|$|Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{represent}} a new capability {{that will provide}} a variety of services in the government (public) and commercial (civil) aviation sectors. The growth of this potential industry {{has not yet been}} realized {{due to the lack of}} a common understanding of what is required to safely operate UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS). To address this deficiency, NASA has established a project called UAS Integration in the NAS (UAS in the NAS), under the Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP) of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). This project provides an opportunity to transition concepts, technology, algorithms, and knowledge to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other stakeholders to help them define the requirements, regulations, and issues for routine UAS access to the NAS. The safe, routine, and efficient integration of UAS into the NAS requires new radio frequency (RF) spectrum allocations and a new data communications system which is both secure and scalable with increasing UAS traffic without adversely impacting the Air Traffic Control (<b>ATC)</b> <b>communication</b> system. These data communications, referred to as Control and Non-Payload Communications (CNPC), whose purpose is to exchange information between the unmanned aircraft and the ground control station to ensure safe, reliable, and effective unmanned aircraft flight operation. A Communications Subproject within the UAS in the NAS Project has been established to address issues related to CNPC development, certification and fielding. The focus of the Communications Subproject is on validating and allocating new RF spectrum and data link communications to enable civil UAS integration into the NAS. The goal is to validate secure, robust data links within the allocated frequency spectrum for UAS. A vision, architectural concepts, and seed requirements for the future commercial UAS CNPC system have been developed by RTCA Special Committee 203 (SC- 203) in the process of determining formal recommendations to the FAA in its role provided for under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. NASA intends to conduct its research and development in keeping with this vision and associated architectural concepts. The prototype communication systems developed and tested by NASA will be used to validate and update the initial SC- 203 requirements in order to provide a foundation for SC- 203 's Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) ...|$|E
40|$|Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) are {{becoming}} more and more popular with an increasing number of companies using them in the fields of precision agriculture, emergency delivery of medical aid and preventive maintenance. Trials are being made to extend their use to public safety, monitoring traffic, providing internet and even air taxi services. These RPAS operations are currently handled on a case-by-case basis and operated in segregated airspace by creating temporary restricted areas for other traffic. With the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) estimating that in the next 30 years 20 % of the traffic will be remotely piloted, the option of airspace segregation will no longer be feasible. Therefore, integrating RPAS with current manned operations will be required. In doing so, however, the current levels of safety and efficiency should not be compromised. The command and control link (C 2), which connects the remotely piloted aircraft and the remote pilot station, plays a pivotal role in the controllability of the aircraft, <b>ATC</b> <b>communication</b> and conflict detection and avoidance systems (CD&A). This project, which is conducted between Delft University of Technology and EUROCONTROL, aims at establishing a methodology of determining how different percentages of flights that are remotely piloted and different C 2 link failure rates influence the number of separation losses (blind encounters). For this, fast time simulations of a 24 -hour period of the Dutch airspace are performed in AirTOp. This study will contribute to the integration of RPAS in non-segregated airspace and will serve as an input for the regulatory bodies which are yet to set performance standards on RPAS, particularly the C 2 link. Replacing between 10 - 50 % of the flights in the Dutch airspace by RPAS with failure rates of the C 2 link of 0. 01 - 0. 001 resulted in 1 - 15 flights being replaced by an RPAS with C 2 link failure. This generated an additional number of blind encounters between 1. 8 - 23. 6, or an increase of 0. 09 - 1. 18 % compared to the baseline situation (same traffic, no RPAS). Also, a linear relationship was found between the number of RPAS experiencing a failure of the C 2 link and the number of blind encounters. The project also investigates how an RPAS that experiences a failure of the C 2 link right at the moment when it enters an ATC sector in Langen FIR (EDGGPHHM) penalizes key ATM performance indicators. The considered KPIs are: number of potential conflicts, air traffic controller task load, sector occupancy, distance flown, flight time, fuel consumption and altitude deviation. The scope is limited to en-route operations above 500 ft and the contingency strategy followed by the RPAS once it loses the C 2 link is to proceed to its destination along its originally submitted flight plan. At the same time, air traffic controllers would enforce a separation bubble around the RPAS, such that a buffer is created for the situations in which the remotely piloted aircraft might deviate from it route or behave erratically. Two RPAS performance models are considered: MQ- 9 Reaper, a turboprop with a lower cruise speed and climb/descent performance than current civil aircraft and RQ- 4 A Global Hawk, a turbofan with a cruise speed close to that of civil aircraft and a rate of climb slightly higher. The results of the Monte Carlo tests are analyzed using ANOVA and MANOVA tests. Increasing the size of the separation bubble around the RPAS with C 2 link failure by 20 %, 40 % and 60 % resulted in an increase in the number of potential conflicts of 8. 3 %, 9. 2 % and 12. 0 % when a MQ- 9 was used. The impact on controller task load was found to be small (increase of 0. 4 %) and not affected by the size of the separation bubble. Similarly the other KPIs were not affected by a separation increases of up to 60 %. Switching 10 - 30 % of the flights to RPAS and using even larger sizes of the separation bubble (twice or three times as large as the minimum ICAO standards) increased the number of potential conflicts by up to 72. 9 %, sector occupancy by 11. 2 % and the additional time spent in the sector by 1. 4 %. Based on the separation requirements which will be enforced around RPAS, the methodology used in the report can be used to assess the impact of experiencing a C 2 link loss on the ATM environment.
