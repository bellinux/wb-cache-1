30|$|In the {{announcement}} phase, users are {{informed about the}} subscribed MBS sessions, such as list of TV channels and the relevant contents. An announcement can be distributed in either multicast or unicast fashion. We have implemented both approaches. In case of multicast distribution, we have provided a specific multicast channel, for each package or channel offered by the service provider, to send announcements from the MBS source to clients. In case of unicast distribution, a user periodically receives announcements relevant to its subscribed packages or channels from an <b>announcement</b> <b>server,</b> co-located with the MBS source. In both cases, either the multicast IP address of {{the announcement}} multicast group, or the IP address of the <b>announcement</b> <b>server,</b> is communicated to the client during his subscription to the relevant channel or package. After receiving an announcement, a user can join the multicast group (session join) relevant to the selected content and, after being authorized by the MBSC-SS, the multicast data transfer phase from the MBS source starts. Finally, if either a data stream ends or a user leaves the current session, the session leave signaling exchange closes the network bearers towards the specific subscriber and, if that user is the last one within an MBS zone, network resources are released.|$|E

Anycast applications typically feature external [...] "heartbeat" [...] monitoring of the server's function, and withdraw the route <b>announcement</b> if the <b>server</b> fails. In some cases this is done by the actual servers announcing the anycast prefix to the router over OSPF or another IGP. If the servers die, the router will automatically withdraw the announcement.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The rapid {{advancement}} {{of information technology}} {{has led to an}} explosive expansion of web-based learning. Numerous academic institutions have implemented e-learning system for not just supporting distance learning, but also for their conventional mode of teaching delivery namely for discussion, sharing materials and posting announcement. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the improvement of current e-learning systems that require students to manually download teaching materials and check for new announcements posted by instructors. The system is developed in three-tier architecture and tested using functional testing. The system is installed on student’s computer and has timer feature which instructs server to perform the checking procedures to look for new documents and announcements for every scheduled period of time. Any new documents and announcements will be automatically downloaded to student’s computer. The system is successfully developed and believed can improve the e-learning system. The study implies potential time saving as students do not have to manually check for new course document and announcement posted by instructors in e-learning. For future works, it is proposed that push technology is implemented to initiate the process of checking new document and <b>announcement</b> from <b>server,</b> which can reduce the use of network resources.

50|$|The World Wide Web had {{a number}} of {{differences}} from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot.Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. Coming two months after the <b>announcement</b> that the <b>server</b> implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System.Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (NCSA-UIUC), led by Marc Andreessen. Funding for Mosaic came from the U.S. High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991, one of several computing developments initiated by U.S. Senator Al Gore. Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet, such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at INRIA (a French national computer research lab) with support from the European Commission DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many notable websites were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.|$|R
