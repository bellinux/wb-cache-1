40|$|Abstract. The 2 Cr 13 <b>axle</b> <b>sleeve,</b> used in N 52 water pumps, {{suffered}} wear {{after being}} tested {{for a relatively}} short time and fractured when it was beat under the dynamic load. Optical metallographic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Vickers hardness tester for the fractured 2 Cr 13 <b>axle</b> <b>sleeve</b> were used to determine the most probable causes of the failure. The results showed that the failure was mainly due to the inappropriate technological parameters of high frequency induction heating and a large amplitude rotor vibration. Meantime, cracks were easily found not only close to the frayed surface but also in the inner part contributed to the inappropriate parameters. Finally, the proper protections were advised to be used for preventing this type of failure for the <b>axle</b> <b>sleeve</b> from happening again in the further...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Based on the {{analysis}} of the common NN-type involute planetary gear reducer with small tooth number difference, this paper replaced the traditional eccentric <b>axle</b> <b>sleeve</b> with double eccentric crankshaft, so as to simplify the structure of involute planetary gear reducer with small tooth number difference; and then used closed graph to select the modification coefficients of the internal gear pairs thereby accomplishing the design of the new type reducer; Finally, used ANSYS Workbench software to analyze the modal of 3 D virtual prototype, and arrived at a realized conclusion:the inherent frequency of the system is much higher than the input frequency, so resonance will not occur. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{instrument}} of electromagnetic measurement while drilling （EM-WMD）works {{in the underground}} environment. In the case of mechanical structure design, sealing is a key problem {{that needs to be}} focused. Based on the application of using the traditional design theory to determine the sealing structure and size, finite element analysis is implemented on the rubber O-ring radial seal structure by using the nonlinear finite element software MSC. Marc. The numerical simulation is processed according to different parameters both of axis and <b>axle</b> <b>sleeve</b> gap value and seal groove fillet radius value, and then both of the influence factors of sealing effect are analyzed. Finally, based on this, the relevant seal structure size is optimized...|$|E

40|$|AbstractF 1 -ATPase is an ATP-driven rotary {{molecular}} motor {{in which the}} central γ-subunit rotates inside a cylinder made of α 3 β 3 subunits. The amino and carboxyl termini of the γ rotor form a coiled coil of α-helices that penetrates the stator cylinder {{to serve as an}} axle. Crystal structures indicate that the axle is supported by the stator at two positions, at the orifice and by the hydrophobic <b>sleeve</b> surrounding the <b>axle</b> tip. The <b>sleeve</b> contacts are almost exclusively to the longer carboxyl-terminal helix, whereas nearly half the orifice contacts are to the amino-terminal helix. Here, we truncated the amino-terminal helix stepwise up to 50 residues, removing one half of the axle all the way up and far beyond the orifice. The half-sliced axle still rotated with an unloaded speed a quarter of the wild-type speed, with torque nearly half the wild-type torque. The truncations were made in a construct where the rotor tip was connected to a β-subunit via a short peptide linker. Linking alone did not change the rotational characteristics significantly. These and previous results show that nearly half the normal torque is generated if rotor-stator interactions either at the orifice or at the sleeve are preserved, suggesting that the make of the motor is quite robust...|$|R
