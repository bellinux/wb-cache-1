50|$|Levofenfluramine (INN), or (−)-3-trifluoromethyl-N-ethyl{{amphetamine}}, {{also known}} as (−)-fenfluramine or (R)-fenfluramine, is a drug of the amphetamine family that, itself (i.e., in enantiopure form), was never marketed. It is the levorotatory enantiomer of fenfluramine, the racemic form of the compound, whereas the dextrorotatory enantiomer is dexfenfluramine. Both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents</b> {{that have been used}} clinically in the treatment of obesity (and hence, levofenfluramine has been as well since it is a component of fenfluramine). However, they have since been discontinued due to reports of causing cardiovascular conditions such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, adverse effects that are likely to be caused by excessive stimulation of 5-HT2B receptors expressed on heart valves.|$|E
50|$|Epidemics {{of fatal}} {{pulmonary}} hypertension and heart valve damage associated with pharmaceutical <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents</b> {{have led to}} the withdrawal of products from the market. This was the case with aminorex in the 1960s, and again in the 1990s with fenfluramine (see: Fen-phen). Likewise, association of the related appetite suppressant phenylpropanolamine with hemorrhagic stroke led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request its withdrawal from the market in the United States in 2000, and similar concerns regarding ephedrine resulted in an FDA ban on its inclusion in dietary supplements in 2004. A Federal judge later overturned this ban in 2005 during a challenge by supplement maker Nutraceuticals. It is also debatable as to whether the ephedrine ban {{had more to do with}} its use as a precursor in methamphetamine manufacture rather than health concerns with the ingredient as such.|$|E

The action of norfenfluramine on 5-HT2B receptors on heart valves {{leads to a}} characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve, known as cardiac fibrosis. This side effect led to the withdrawal of fenfluramine as an <b>anorectic</b> <b>agent</b> worldwide, and to the withdrawal of benfluorex in Europe, as both fenfluramine and benfluorex form norfenfluramine as an active metabolite.

The FDA alerted medical doctors that it had received nine additional reports of the same type, and requested all health care professionals to report any such cases to the agency’s MedWatch program, or to their respective pharmaceutical manufacturers. The FDA subsequently received over a hundred additional reports of valvular heart disease in people taking fen-phen, fenfluramine alone or dexfenfluramine alone. The FDA requested that the manufacturers of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine stress the potential risk to the heart in the drugs' labeling and in package inserts. As of 1997, the FDA was continuing to receive reports of valvular heart disease in persons who had taken these drugs. This disease typically involves the aortic and mitral valves.|$|E

All drugs were presented as diet admixtures over 3 or 4 consecutive days. Total food and water intakes, the temporal pattern of feeding, and the average meal frequency and meal size were measured using computerized data collection procedures. Inhibitors of carbohydrate absorption failed to suppress food intake in either obese or lean Zucker rats and had no effect on the parameters of feeding.

We examined the hypothesis that dexfenfluramine may stimulate release of serotonin from the ileum by inhibition of K + channels. In an isolated loop of rat ileum perfused with a physiologic salt solution, the administration of dexfenfluramine, its major metabolite d-norfenfluramine, the potassium channel blocker 4 -aminopyridine (5 mM), and caffeine (30 mM) increased serotonin levels in the venous effluent. Potassium chloride (60 mM) tended to increase serotonin levels. In genetically susceptible individuals, dexfenfluramine may induce pulmonary hypertension by increasing cytosolic calcium in enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, thus releasing serotonin and causing vasoconstriction.

During that observation period, fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market because of cardiovascular side effects associated with prescribing higher doses in combination with phentermine for weight loss. In March 2002, a Belgian Royal Decree was issued permitting further study of fenfluramine in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy.

40|$|The main {{components}} of the metabolic syndrome (MS) are abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, raised blood pressure, insulin resistance with or without glucose intolerance, and proinflammatory and prothrombotic states. The clustering of these metabolic risk factors significantly {{increases the risk of}} type 2 diabetes and promotes vascular endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress. The net result is an increase in the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Therefore, management of MS is of utmost importance, especially considering its rapidly increasing prevalence in a population with rising obesity rates and its significant cardiovascular implications. The primary management of this syndrome involves the correction of the underlying risk factors [...] obesity, physical inactivity, and an atherogenic diet [...] with lifestyle modifications including increased physical activity and dietary modification. Smoking cessation also should be encouraged. However, pharmacologic therapies are often required to address cardiovascular risk factors. These agents can be categorized broadly into 1) <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents,</b> 2) insulin-sensitizing agents, 3) statins, and 4) renin-angiotensin system antagonists.

40|$|Orlistat, {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of the pancreatic and intestinal lipases, {{is the first}} member of a new therapeutic class approved for the treatment of obesity. Its administration with fat-containing foods results in a partial inhibition of triglyceride hydrolysis in the digestive lumen and subsequent reduction of the free fatty acids and monoglycerides absorption. At the usual dosage of 120 mg tid, about 30 % of ingested fat are excreted non digested in feces. When administered with a mildly hypocaloric diet, orlistat contributes to loss of weight by a additional caloric deficit and promotes further compliance of the obese patient to the dietary recommendations. Several double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies have shown a statistically significant loss of weight of about 10 % when orlistat was prescribed with a well balanced, mildly hypocaloric diet to obese patients during one year. Moreover, small but significant beneficial changes in the serum lipid levels occurred in these patients. Because the orlistat molecule is not reabsorbed, its side effects are mostly due to the gastrointestinal effects and consist in steatorhea after fatty meals. However, the treatment is generally well tolerated.

40|$|Non-insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus (NIDDM, type 2 diabetes) is a heterogeneous disease {{resulting from a}} dynamic interaction between defects in insulin secretion and insulin action. There are various pharmacological approaches to improving glucose homeostasis, but those currently used in clinical practice either do not succeed in restoring normoglycaemia in most patients or fail after a variable period of time. For glycaemic regulation, 4 classes of drugs are currently available: sulphonylureas, biguanides (metformin), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose) and insulin, {{each of which has}} a different mode and site of action. These standard pharmacological treatments may be used individually for certain types of patients, or may be combined in a stepwise fashion to provide more ideal glycaemic control for most patients. Adjunct treatments comprise a few pharmacological approaches which may help to improve glycaemic control by correcting some abnormalities frequently associated with NIDDM, such as obesity (serotoninergic <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents)</b> and hyperlipidaemia (benfluorex).

Infusion of 5 mug NFFL in 0. 125 mul aCSF/min into the nucleus paraventricularis of the hypothalamus (PVN) caused a significant increase of blood glucose, plasma epinephrine (E), and corticosterone concentrations. Plasma levels of FFA, insulin, or norepinephrine (NE) remained unchanged. Lower doses of NFFL (0. 5 and 0. 05 mug/min) did not affect peripheral metabolism. The effects of NFFL in the PVN were completely prevented by prior administration of a 5 -HT 1 antagonist, (S) -(-) propranolol. The exercise-induced increase of plasma NE was reduced after prior administration of 5 mug NFFL/min into the PVN. Plasma E responses tended to be increased. The exercise-induced alterations in glucose, FFA, corticosterone, and insulin were not affected by NFFL infusion into the PVN.

40|$|A {{number of}} drugs {{have been used}} to stimulate {{appetite}} and produce weight gain in older persons. Historically, the agent first used was cyproheptadine acetate [1], which has proved to be minimally effective and can produce delirium. No controlled trials have been conducted in older persons. Ornithine oxoglutarate, a glutamine precursor, is an orexigenic agent that results in weight gain. It has been used successfully in Europe but is not available in the United States [2]. Two agents are widely used to stimulate appetite, namely, megestrol acetate and dronabinol. The effects of these agents are discussed in detail. Megestrol acetate Megestrol acetate (Megace) (Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey) is a progestational agent that produces an increase in food intake. The mechanisms by which megestrol acetate increases appetite is uncertain but are thought to involve alterations in CNS neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of food intake [3]. In animals, estrogen decreases food intake, and progestational agents antagonize this effect. Megestrol acetate also antagonizes cytokine production [4]. Tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-a), interleukin- 6, and ciliary neurotrophic factor are potent <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents</b> that also cause muscle loss [5 – 7]. Thus, the effect of megestrol acetate may involve, in part, the inhibition of the effects of cytokines on food intake and muscle. With use of megestrol acetate, weight gain has been reported in numerous patients with cancer-related anorexia and wasting [8]. Several randomized, pla-cebo-controlled trials have confirmed the effect of megestrol acetate on appetit...|$|E

In a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study, we examined hepatic and peripheral insulin action by the sequential hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique with infusion of 3 -[3 H]-glucose in eight obese NIDDM patients and in eight obese non-diabetics, matched for age, sex and body mass index. Body weight was kept constant. After 14 days of fluoxetine, 60 mg daily, in NIDDM half-maximal peripheral glucose uptake was achieved at a lower insulin level than after placebo (ED 50 pgu: 180. 5 +/- 25. 8 vs. 225. 3 +/- 39. 9 mU/l, P < 0. 05), but not in non-diabetics (140 +/- 15. 3 vs. 135. 3 +/- 22. 2 mU/l, n. s.). Maximal peripheral glucose uptake (Vmaxpgu) did not change significantly. Multivariate analysis disclosed no differences in the effect of fluoxetine between NIDDM and non-diabetics. When non-diabetics and NIDDM were considered together, only the most insulin-resistant individuals demonstrated a decrease in ED 50 pgu (P < 0. 001). Likewise, only the individuals with the most outspoken hepatic insulin resistance demonstrated a decrease in insulin level, at which hepatic glucose production (HGP) is completely suppressed (HGP 0) (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Most {{patients}} with Type 2 diabetes are significantly overweight, and diet-induced weight loss can provide marked {{improvement in their}} glycaemic control. As conventional therapy combining diet and exercise usually has a poor long-term success rate, more aggressive weight reduction programmes have been proposed {{for the treatment of}} severely obese diabetic patients, including very-low-calorie diets, anti-obesity drugs and bariatric surgery. Very-low-calorie diets usually have a remarkable short-term effect, and energy restriction and weight reduction are positive factors for the glycaemic control of obese diabetic subjects. However, the long-term efficacy of these methods remains doubtful since weight regain is a common phenomenon. Although anti-obesity (anorectic) drugs may help patients to follow a restricted diet and lose weight, their overall efficacy on body weight and glycaemia is generally modest, and their long-term safety still questionable. Interestingly, serotoninergic <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents</b> have been shown to improve both the insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control of obese diabetic patients independently of weight loss. Bariatric surgery may be helpful in well-selected patients. The correction of weight excess after successful gastroplasty fully reverses the abnormalities of insulin secretion, clearance and action on glucose metabolism present in markedly obese non-diabetic patients, and allows interruption or reduction of insulin therapy and antidiabetic oral agents in most obese diabetic patients. In conclusion, weight loss is a major goal in treating obese {{patients with}} Type 2 diabetes, and aggressive weight reduction programmes may be used in selected patients refractory to conventional diet and drug treatment. However, long-term prospective studies are needed for more precise determination of the role of such a strategy in the overall management of obese diabetic patients. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Acute effects of methysergide were determined 4 h after a single injection (10 mg/kg) in a separate group (n = 8). Controls (n = 8) had implanted minipumps delivering saline, and also received a saline injection 4 h before sacrifice. Food intake was significantly increased (p < 0. 01) by both acute and chronic methysergide treatment. In the chronically treated rats, NPY levels were significantly increased over controls in the arcuate nucleus (ARC; by 41 %, p = 0. 02) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN; by 40 %, p < 0. 01). Acute methysergide treatment also increased NPY concentrations in the ARC (by 81 %, p < 0. 01) and PVN (by 30 %, p < 0. 01). Methysergide administration, which stimulated feeding, therefore raised NPY concentrations in the ARC, where NPY is synthesized, and in the PVN, a major site of NPY release where NPY injection induces hyperphagia. These findings suggest that NPYergic and serotoninergic innervations in the hypothalamus interact to regulate food intake, and raise the possibility that increased NPY release may mediate the hyperphagic effect of serotoninergic 5 -HT 1 BC/ receptor blockade...|$|R
40|$|Valvular heart disease, {{inducing}} valvular regurgitation, {{has been}} described in users of drugs such as <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents</b> and ergot derivates. 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "ecstasy") also leads in vitro to the proliferation of cardiac valvular interstitial cells by activation of the 5 -hydroxytryptamine 2 B receptor. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the occurrence of valvulopathy in young adults taking MDMA. Twenty-nine subjects using or having used MDMA and 29 gender- and age-matched controls were blindly evaluated with echocardiography. Eight subjects (28 %) who took MDMA had abnormal echocardiographic results using the United States Food and Drug Administration's criteria for appetite suppressant-induced valvular heart disease, compared with none in the control group (p = 0. 0045). Six (21 %) subjects had mitral regurgitation of 1 / 4 and 4 (14 %) of ≥ 2 / 4, compared with none in the control group (p = 0. 002). The mean mitral regurgitant area ratios (jet/atrium) were 12 ± 9. 8 % and 5 ± 1. 3 %, respectively (p = 0. 007). Tricuspid regurgitation ≥ 2 / 4 was present in 13 MDMA users (45 %) and absent in controls (p < 0. 001). The mean tricuspid regurgitant area ratios were 19 ± 9. 5 % and 9 ± 4. 5 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). Four MDMA users (14 %) had mild aortic regurgitation (p = 0. 11). Valvular "strands" were present in 6 MDMA users (21 %) and in none of the controls (p = 0. 02). In conclusion, MDMA may lead to mild to moderate valvular heart disease and valvular strands. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study is presented of all patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) observed at Zürich University Hospital between 1980 and 1990. In 16 of the 36 patients (23 females/ 13 males, median age 40) {{there was a}} known risk factor for PPH: HIV infection (8), use of <b>anorectic</b> <b>agents</b> (7), liver cirrhosis (1). In 20 cases no risk factor could be found. In 4 of them PPH was diagnosed before the study period. We calculated an incidence of PPH in north-east Switzerland of about 1. 5 cases per million per year. The clinical course in the 20 patients without known risk factors for PPH was analyzed in more detail: treatment consisted of oral anticoagulation (15) and vasodilators (7); the median survival was 48 (1 - 307) months. Only 7 patients (35 %) are still alive. Prognosis of PPH correlated with the severity of hemodynamics. The median survival in patients with pulmonary vascular resistance of or = 1000 dyn. sec. cm- 5 was 151 (106 - 307) months versus 13 (1 - 73) months (p or = 50 mm Hg it was 151 (73 - 307) versus 13 (1 - 106) months (p = 0. 0015), with right atrial pressure of or = 10 mm Hg it was 90 (4 - 307) versus 3 (1 - 60) months, and with mixed venous O 2 -saturation of > or = 62 % versus < 63 % it was 119 (4 - 307) versus 14 (1 - 106) months (p = 0. 024). PPH is a rare disease with a poor prognosis depending mainly on the severity of hemodynamic changes. However, despite this fact, the clinical course of individual patients may be unexpectedly favourable. Treatment of PPH is limited, and lung transplantation remains the most promising therapeutic approach. In this regard {{the quality of life}} aspect is of great importance...|$|E

40|$|Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a {{sympathomimetic}} amine, {{has been}} widely used over the past 40 years as a decongestant and, in much larger dosages, as an appetite suppressant. Considerable interest has recently been shown in this drug due to its increasing popularity as an over-the-counter <b>anorectic</b> <b>agent.</b> Much controversy exists concerning the unfavourable side-effects of PPA resulting from the higher doses required for appetite suppression and the potential of this drug for abuse. A literature search revealed a paucity of information concerning the determination of PPA in biological fluids and, most noticeably, on the pharmacokinetics of this drug. An original method for determining PPA in serum and urine using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which has increased sensitivity over other published HPLC methods is presented here. The simplicity of the extraction from biological fluids and subsequent determination by HPLC, enables concentrations of PPA to be monitored after a single dose of the drug. This method is therefore readily applicable to bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies. The dissolution profiles of 4 sustained-release formulations of PPA were determined in a modified USP rotating paddle apparatus and the samples analysed using HPLC. A mathematical equation was applied to these data which are {{expressed in terms of}} dissolution parameters. Oral test dosage forms and solutions of PPA were investigated in bioavailability trials using the developed HPLC method to analyse the urine and serum samples. Linear one body compartment kinetics were assumed and the WagnerNelson method used to transform in vivo serum data to absorption plots which were then fitted to the well known Weibull equation. In order to more appropriately characterize the kinetic processes of absorption, distribution and elimination, a more complex model was utilized which involved numerical integration of a series of differential equations. The data were fitted to these models using nonlinear regression techniques. The pharmacokinetics of PPA are shown to exhibit some evidence of nonlinearity. The absorption of the drug appears to be di scontinuous and PPA seems to favour a two body compartment model...|$|R
40|$|Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a {{synthetic}} sympathomimetic amine structurall y related to ephedrine {{has been widely}} used over t he past 40 years as a nasal decongestant and appetite suppressant. It {{has been the focus}} of much controversy concerning the efficacy of the drug in its use as an <b>anorectic</b> <b>agent,</b> and due to the side effects caused by the higher doses of PPA required for appetite suppression. Although extensively used, there is little information concerning the determination of PPA in biological fluids and on the pharmacokinetics of this drug. An adaptation of a published high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay for PPA in serum and urine using U. V. detection at 210 nm is presented. PPA was separated in the reversedphase mode. The method has a limit of sensitivity of 5. 0 ng/mL and 10. 0 ng/mL in serum and urine respectively. Serum concentration data following a single 25 mg dose of phenylpropanolamine in human volunteers demonstrate the application of the analytical method for bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies. After the administration of 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg PPA. HCl solutions to 5 human volunteers, a dose proportionality study demonstrated that PPA appears to exhibit linear kinetics. Linear one body compartment kinetics were assumed and the wagner-Nelson method used to transform in vivo serum data to absorption plots. The serum data were fitted to a model using nonl inear regression techniques to characterize the pharmacokinetic processes of PPA. The absorption of phenylpropanolamine appears to be discontinuous and the drug seems to favour a two body compartment model. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from a steady state study using multiple dosing of PPA. HCl solutions compared with those found from previous studies after the administration of sustained-release formulations. A plasma protein binding study using equilibrium dialysis demonstrated that PPA is not highly protein bound in the blood. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 53 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R
40|$|Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a {{synthetic}} sympathomimetic amine, {{is widely used}} as a nasal decongestant and as an appetite suppressant. Much controversy exists regarding {{the efficacy of the}} drug as an <b>anorectic</b> <b>agent,</b> the related adverse reactions caused by the relatively high doses required for appetite suppression and the potential of this drug for abuse. Whilst numerous studies have been carried out to assess the central and cardiovascular safety of PPA and many investigations have been performed to evaluate efficacy in terms of weight loss in humans, there is a relative paucity of information regarding the effects of PPA on appetite and food intake. A pilot trial was conducted to determine the feasiblility of a multidimensional approach to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PPA as ananorectic agent in humans. Eight normotensive caucasian women who were overweight participated in a randomised double-blind cross-over comparison of PPA (75 mg) and placebo and were dosed to steady-state on a 12 -hour fixed-dose schedule for a period of eleven weeks. Aspects of efficacy evaluated included the effects of PPA on hunger, appetite and satiety,salivation, macro-nutrient food intake and body weight. Standardised scales were used to quantitatively assess the possible subjective mood and behavioural reinforcing effects of PPA. Supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures were monitored continually throughout the trial. In addition, peak and trough blood samp 1 es were taken to monitor serum concentrations of PPA reached at steady-state and patient compliance with the dosing schedule. An adaptation of a published reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay for PPA in serum using U. V. detection at 210 nm is presented. A significant decrease in body weight, salivation, total food intake and carbohydrate consumption was demonstrated following PPA administration. Phenylpropanolamine produced significant decrements in subjective reports of hunger and appetite, whilst apparently having little effect on satiety. No significant changes were observed for blood pressures and PPA did not produce significant mood alterations or behavioural reinforcing effects. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using this muti-faceted approach, with certain design modifications, to evaluate the overall safety and efficacy of PPA as an appetite suppressant. ...|$|R
