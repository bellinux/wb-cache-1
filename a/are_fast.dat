5|$|Jet streams <b>are</b> <b>fast</b> flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} {{air currents}} in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main jet streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the jet.|$|E
5|$|Rotation {{rates of}} massive stars have a {{critical}} {{influence on their}} evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single massive stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both Eta Carinae A and B <b>are</b> <b>fast</b> rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids are {{normally}} a placid Class II meteor shower that {{peaks in the}} early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum zenithal hourly rate is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids <b>are</b> <b>fast,</b> with an entry velocity of /sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of Theta Aurigae, a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation. The Aurigids end on September 4. Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.|$|E

5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators <b>are</b> <b>fast</b> {{enough to catch}} them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, {{marshes and}} bogs. Although some organisms are found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there <b>are</b> <b>fast</b> and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, aquatic plants can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and {{play a part in}} the reduction of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Shoot 'em ups are a subgenre of shooter game, in turn a type {{of action}} game. These games are usually viewed from a {{top-down}} or side-view perspective, and players must use ranged weapons to take action at a distance. The player's avatar is typically a vehicle under constant attack. Thus, the player's goal is to shoot {{as quickly as possible}} at anything that moves or threatens him. In some games, the player's character can withstand some damage; in others, a single hit will result in his destruction. The main skills required in shoot 'em ups <b>are</b> <b>fast</b> reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns. Some games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and the player has to memorise their patterns to survive. These games belong to one of the fastest-paced video game genres.|$|E

5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, {{and almost}} the whole diet consists of grasses. Water {{is an essential}} requirement. There are three distinct social groups: the female herds, the bachelor herds and the territorial bulls.

A single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother until her next calf is born a year later. The black wildebeest inhabits open plains, grasslands and Karoo shrublands.|$|E

With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation. He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng. She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk. Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party, saying that the Communist party {{are the only ones}} who can help save the wong cilik (underclass) of Dukuh Paruk and their starved hamlet.|$|E
