5|$|Expansion of Highbury was {{restricted}} because the East Stand had been {{designated as a}} Grade II listed building <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and {{first decade of the}} 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder {{guns on the}} main deck and 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight of these were also on the main deck <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> served as chase guns on the upper deck, two at the bow and one aft.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, {{there are}} more four {{confirmed}} cases in the country, one in Santa Catarina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>three</b> in São Paulo. Both cases came from USA.

5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Virginia-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In September 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, though Germany surrendered two months later, ending the conflict. After the war, {{they were used to}} bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short. Virginia and New Jersey were sunk in bombing tests in 1923, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> ships were broken up for scrap later that year.|$|E
5|$|Four {{members of}} a Forward Observation Team from Battery C, 371st Field Artillery {{had been in the}} village when the Tank Destroyer unit withdrew. Lieutenant Warren Springer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> men, Sergeant Peter Gacki, T/4 Willard Wibben, and T/5 Billy Queen joined Bouck's unit on the ridge where they could {{continue}} to observe the enemy movement. Bouck distributed them among the foxholes to help reload magazines and reinforce their position.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} reach the final, Dunfermline played three matches; one at home at East End Park and two away from home. Dunfermline scored seven goals and conceded {{only one in the}} rounds before the final, keeping two clean sheets in the process. St Johnstone contested four matches before the final; one at home at McDiarmid Park <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> away, scoring ten goals, conceding three and keeping only one clean sheet.|$|E
25|$|Limpopo played eight {{first-class}} {{matches in}} the 2006-07 season, losing five <b>and</b> drawing <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three.</b> They played seven matches in the Provincial One-Day Challenge, winning two and losing five.|$|R
2500|$|... the Minister {{responsible}} for the Territories excluding the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sovereign Base Areas is Tariq Ahmad, Minister of State for <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> UN. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> territories are <b>the</b> responsibility of Sir Alan Duncan MP, Minister of State for Europe <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americas.|$|R
50|$|Four Canadian {{productions}} {{were among}} the 12 finalist in the competition sponsored by the International Council of the National Academy of Television Arts <b>and</b> Sciences. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> awards went to British TV productions.|$|R
5|$|Kouma's patrol {{was then}} ambushed {{by a group}} of North Koreans dressed in US {{military}} uniforms. Kouma was wounded <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> vehicles had to withdraw, but he held the Agok site until 07:30 the next morning with his single tank. In the attack against A Company, the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon, which was near Agok, but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers' only Super Bowl {{championship}} was won in Super Bowl XXXVII, at {{the conclusion}} of the 2002 season. This was the teams' only Super Bowl appearance, having reached the NFC conference championship on two other occasions. The Buccaneers have been divisional champions six times, three of them in the NFC Central <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> in NFC South. They were the first team to win the NFC South after the NFL restructure in 2002. In their 41-year history, the Buccaneers have played over 500 regular and post-season games and have appeared in the post-season ten times.|$|E
5|$|The core of {{the complex}} has a ring {{structure}} consisting of six proteins that all {{belong to the same}} class of RNases, the RNase PH-like proteins. In archaea there are two different PH-like proteins (called Rrp41 and Rrp42), each present three times in an alternating order. Eukaryotic exosome complexes have six different proteins that form the ring structure. Of these six eukaryotic proteins, three resemble the archaeal Rrp41 protein <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> proteins are more similar to the archaeal Rrp42 protein.|$|E

5|$|The law {{partnership}} of Despard, Maxwell, and Goff was in operation until {{the autumn of}} 1866, when Maxwell was elected as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Maxwell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> justices were chosen because of their early statehood leadership, and because they could be depended upon to defend the new state from Virginia sympathies and uphold the Unionist cause. While serving on the court, the major issues that faced Maxwell and the justices primarily involved post-war reconstruction and sectional acrimonies across the state. He served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court from January 1, 1867 until December 31, 1872.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{arrived at}} Fremantle on 18 February. The {{sight of the}} Australian coast had been eagerly {{anticipated}} by the soldiers, who broke into cheers when it became visible shortly before noon that day. Nieuw Amsterdam and Queen of Bermuda berthed in Fremantle Harbour, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> troop ships dropped anchor at Gage Roads. The Western Australian members of the 9th Division were disembarked, and the ships loaded supplies and mail. As Queen of Bermuda left the convoy at Fremantle, her remaining 517 passengers were transferred to Nieuw Amsterdam. This resulted in considerable overcrowding {{for the remainder of}} the liner's voyage.|$|E
5|$|William Herschel {{discovered}} {{the first two}} moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five have planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets {{if they were in}} direct orbit about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.|$|E

50|$|A large {{round of}} {{regional}} elections {{were held in}} Italy on 31 May 2015 in seven of the twenty regions composing the country, including four of the ten largest ones: Campania, Veneto, Apulia <b>and</b> Tuscany. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> regions holding elections were Liguria, Marche, Umbria.|$|R
5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E
5|$|A. pinnatum <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> tree waratah species {{lie in the}} {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, {{along with}} the true waratahs (Telopea), Oreocallis and the Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal (arising {{at the ends of}} branches), and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predates the splitting of the supercontinent Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest that they are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters in the Eocene. Triporopollenites ambiguus is an ancient member of the proteaceae known only from pollen deposits, originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of the Tasmanian waratah (Telopea truncata), A. pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.pinnatum to be the earliest offshoot within the genus and sister to the other three species. Along with members of other genera in the Embothriinae, A.pinnatum has crimson pollen, while the other three Alloxylon species have yellow pollen. Hence {{it is likely that the}} ancestral pollen colour was red, and remained so with the emergence of the genus Alloxylon, yet changed to yellow after the divergence of A.pinnatum.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> tree waratah species {{lie in the}} {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, {{along with}} the true waratahs (Telopea), South American Oreocallis, and Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predate the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest they are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the Eocene radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.flammeum and A.brachycarpum to be sister species, with A.wickhamii as their next closest relative. A.flammeum has yellow pollen grains, like A.brachycarpum and A.wickhamii but unlike all {{other members of the}} Embothriinae.|$|E

5|$|At 11:45, Armide {{surrendered}} to Centaur, followed 15 minutes later by Minerve. Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement and could not hope to continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed to outrun Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships, which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped.|$|E
5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS national championship game. In 2000, the BCS Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the national championship game rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The national championship game rotated to a different location each year, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national championship game.|$|E
5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>three</b> may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper {{was attached to the}} lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E
