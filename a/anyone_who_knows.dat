Max is called on to investigate a gunfight at a warehouse owned by Max's old associate Vladimir Lem and discovers the place has been attacked by a group of hitmen called the Cleaners.

While attempting to track down a contact, Mona is arrested because of her crimes and is taken in to the police station, despite Max's protests.|$|E

500|$|Various {{historians have}} given Adams {{recognition}} {{as an important}} figure from {{the early years of}} baseball. Thorn has written that he [...] "may be counted as first among the Fathers of Baseball." [...] O'Maxfield said of Adams: [...] "Without , we wouldn't have the game we know and love as baseball today." [...] The [...] "father" [...] label was rejected by Ryczek; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport, but called him a [...] "collaborator" [...] in its development. On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 [...] "Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. He says of Adams, [...] "Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You ask <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't even talk about; but they all know Doc Adams. He was the glue that held things together {{in the early part of}} baseball." [...] Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot. Ten of the 16 committee members supported him, two fewer than the number needed for induction.|$|E

He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn."

The album included the controversial [...] "White Devil Rise", recorded during the sessions for Danzig 4 in response to inflammatory comments by Louis Farrakhan and {{his use of the}} term [...] "The White Devil". The song is Danzig's conjecture as to what would happen if Farrakhan incited the passive white race to rise up and start a race war: “No one wants to see a race war.

2500|$|After McQueary was {{identified}} as the graduate assistant who reported the 2002 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect the boy from Sandusky (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), {{as well as for}} not reporting the incident to police himself.
