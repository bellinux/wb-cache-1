5|$|Although {{paleontology}} became established around 1800, earlier thinkers {{had noticed}} {{aspects of the}} fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water. During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils <b>and</b> <b>proposed</b> a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) proposed a theory of climate change based {{on the presence of}} petrified bamboo in regions that in his time were too dry for bamboo.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} theorists of political thought in Renaissance Europe.

He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated author, was a passionate proponent of peaceful resolution of international conflicts. Bishop Wawrzyniec Goślicki (Goslicius), who wrote and published in 1568 a study entitled De optimo senatore (The Counsellor in the 1598 English translation), was another popular and influential in the West political thinker.|$|E
