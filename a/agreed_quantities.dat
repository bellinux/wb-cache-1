While there are examples of fully integrated value chains that do not involve smallholders (e.g. Unilever operates tea estates and tea processing facilities in Kenya and then blends and packs the tea in Europe before selling it as Lipton, Brooke Bond or PG Tips brands), the great bulk of agricultural value chains involve sales to companies from independent farmers. Such arrangements frequently involve contract farming in which the farmer undertakes to supply <b>agreed</b> <b>quantities</b> of a crop or livestock product, based on the quality standards and delivery requirements of the purchaser, often at a price that is established in advance.

His initiation in abandoning Dummugudem- Nagarjunasagar Tail Pond project and leaving Ichamapalli project for long term perspective etc had given right direction to the progress of irrigation in Telangana. He defended big lift irrigation schemes, namely Kaleshwaram and Palamuru Rangareddy projects, for Telangana State as they are inevitable due to geographical and climatic conditions of the state.Advisor’s contributions in establishing a firm base for interstate aspects on water front for Telangana will remain remembered forever. In Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal issues or Supreme Court issues he was always the guiding force. He always worked with accommodative and audacity. Without antagonising the Central Government’s view of interlinking of rivers, while representing Telangana State at meetings of National Water Development Agency, he advocated for revision of surplus waters available at Ichampalli, keeping the Tribunal Awards and changed technological advancements also in view. He presented that the surplus waters above 50% dependability can be diverted. In response, Ministry of Water Resources has constituted a committee to revise the guidelines to calculate the surplus river waters in the country.Getting the nod from Chief Minister KCR, Advisor Vidyasagar Rao attended the KRMB Meeting in October,2014. It was {{turning point in the}} functioning of KRMB. Explaining the relevant Clauses of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 and supremacy of the Tribunal Award, Vidyasagar Rao could establish that KRMB did not have the powers to allocate the waters on its own. The then Chairman of KRMB accepted the substance of the arguments. Either Bachawat Tribunal Award or <b>agreed</b> <b>quantities</b> by both the States shall only be the basis for distribution of available waters by the Board, whether it is for Krishna Delta, or from NSP and Srisailam Reservoirs. In June, 2015 to avoid any troubles in the coming year 2015-16, Mr Rao {{played a major role in}} arriving at an adhoc arrangement, for sharing of Krishna waters, in a temporary ratio of 299 : 512, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh respectively. He was also able to clarify the concept of ‘enbloc’ allocations of the Tribunal which paved way for utilisation of Krishna river waters anywhere in the basin as per requirement. Because of these arrangements, the water sharing for that year happened without any problems. And, in June, 2016, the same arrangement had been extended for this water year 2016-17 also.On the basis of Tribunal Awards, Vidyasagar Rao strongly advocated for rightful share to Telangana State in the waters diverted from Godavari to Krishna River. At Godavari River Management Board meetings also, acumen of Advisor Vidyasagar Rao could stall the Andhra Pradesh intentions of putting control of Major Projects on Godavari River within Telangana State, into the hands of Godavari River Management Board (GRMB).

40|$|ACP {{countries}} with preferential {{terms of trade}} in certain agricultural products have been concerned about {{the potential impact of}} the 'single market' in the EC after 1992. In theory, products from non-ACP countries could then compete freely with ACP products such as sugar, bananas, rum and rice. The EC position, affirmed in November, is that under the new Lome Convention there will be no modification of the previously agreed terms of trade. Moreover, should Haiti and the Dominican Republic join the ACP group, there is further assurance that this would not result in any reduction in current quotas for these products. Nevertheless, CTA was requested by governments of ACP member states in the Caribbean to organize a regional conference on Agriculture Diversification and this was held in collaboration with CARDI (Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute) in Bridgetown, Barbados from November 27 to December 1, 1989. The need for agricultural diversification has been recognized for over a century in the Caribbean yet more than half of agricultural exports in some countries are still from sugar cane while bananas comprise a substantial part of agricultural exports in several other states. Obviously the extent of dependence on a single crop varies but even those {{countries with}} less dependence are feeling an urgent need to spread potential risks not only from market downturns but also from climatic damage and pest or disease attack. Definitions of diversification vary, ranging from one extreme of totally abandoning a crop in favour of one or more alternatives to maintaining current output of a major crop but simultaneously initiating or increasing production of alternatives, be it other crops, livestock or agro-based industries. Already there have been several successful examples of diversification and substitution. Twenty years ago St Lucia went out of sugar cane into bananas, whereas Jamaica has reduced dependence on sugar by developing the production of bananas, coffee and, more recently, horticulture and aquaculture. Dominica, once dependent on citrus and still a major producer of bananas, has been diversifying very successfully into exported fruit, vegetables and ginger. Meanwhile, several countries that already have a more diverse export base (Grenada with bananas, cocoa and nutmeg, Guyana with sugar and rice and Belize with sugar, citrus and forest products) are nevertheless looking at reducing their dependence on established crops further by initiating new enterprises even though production of existing crops may not be reduced. The Mauritius experience A paper given by Mrs P Aubeeluck of Mauritius provided {{a good example of how}} it is not necessary to reduce production of a major crop in order to diversify. Mauritius has long been known as a > and government policy has been to maintain production to meet the 491, 000 tonne annual export quota to the EC under the Lome Convention terms. However, stringent efforts have been made to improve the profitability of sugar production and this has been achieved by making new types of sugar for sale under Mauritius brand names; optimizing use of sugar-cane by-products; and by making double use of land under cane for growing food crops. The special sugars include a golden granulated product, light and dark Muscavado and Demerara for the EC and small consignments of special sugars sold to the United States, Sweden, New Zealand and Switzerland. Bagasse is a potential source of renewable energy and an alternative to imported coal and oil. It is considered that the optimum use of this by-product can supply some 80 % of overall energy requirements in Mauritius against the current 20 % with the added benefit of constituting a low pollution hazard. Annual molasses production is in the region of 170, 000 tonnes, of which some 83 % is exported. The remainder is used by local distillery plants for the manufacture of alcohol, rum, perfumes, vinegar and a variety of drugs. In addition, molasses is used by many livestock farmers in the form of molasses/urea blocks for their cattle. Every year the industry produces about 200, 000 tonnes of filter scums which are used as bio-fertilizer. The use of cane tops for cattle feeding has been a long-standing practice and the potential for ensiling cane tops will enable further use of what remains an under-utilized resource. Inter-line cropping of cane rows with food crops is another long established practice. During the Second World War, with disruption of food supplies from abroad, a scheme was implemented to cultivate all basic food crops on 27 % of land under sugar cane. The increased population and high cost of food imports have aroused national awareness, and the need for self-reliance and import substitution has become a major concern of policy makers. Government commitment in the form of fixing floor prices for priority commodities and regulation of imports has resulted in Mauritius becoming self-sufficient in potatoes and turmeric since 1985. Self-sufficiency in onions and garlic is expected within two or three years and other major products such as beans, groundnut, chillies, rice and fresh milk have also been substituted increasingly for imports since Independence. Agro-industrial production - canning of fruit, vegetables and fish, processing dairy products and pork, milling rice, dehydration of turmeric, manufacture of livestock feed, and local processing of various imported raw food products (vegetable oil and wheat) - has increased from Rs 81. 8 million in 1982 to Rs 214 million in 1986. Finally, two new agricultural enterprises have provided additional diversification for the economy. Deer farming, based on deer imported in colonial fumes from Java, has developed both on culling of animals kept semi-wild on marginal lands and others raised in feedlots. Production is expected to be 70, 000 head by 1992. And the yield of freshwater prawns (Macrobachium rosenbergii), now 50 tonnes per year is expected to double very soon. Caribbean options Several Caribbean countries are already considering some of the options that have proved successful in Mauritius. Jamaica has developed a successful aquaculture industry, also based on freshwater prawns, and GUYSUCO in Guyana has been experimenting with tilapia. Belize has extensive estuarine lands that could be utilized for aquaculture. The alternatives for diversifying within the sugar industry itself and thereby improving profitability are extensive and a wide range of options was provided by Keith Laurie of Barbados when he stressed the need to look for alternative uses for sugar if cane acreage is to be maintained. He instanced Grenada's interest in cane that is high in reducing sugars suited for rum production rather than high in sucrose for sugar. He also questioned the economics of extracting the last fraction of sugar from cane when alternatively it might increase profitability by extracting less at reduced cost while leaving more sugar in the bagasse, which would then become a more nutritious livestock feed. There is also potential for cane production specifically for livestock feed. Mr Laurie suggested breeders and growers look again at previously discarded varieties of cane that had high yields but were rejected for sugar product on because they were too high in dry matter, protein, fibre or minerals; these could be ideally suited for feeding to ruminants. This would, in effect, be a new crop entirely separate from sugar production. Cane is the best converter of solar energy Robert Reid of Jamaica (left), now working with CARDI in Grenada and David Demacque, Director of Agriculture, St Lucia and this characteristic of the plant could be harnessed to benefit livestock production. From St Lucia the Director of Finance, Dwight Venner, said that there was no question of St Lucia reducing production of bananas since the size of the country does not allow for a second major crop. But costs of banana production could be reduced by consolidating production on the best land, quality could be improved further and new varieties of smaller, sweeter bananas developed for new sectors of the export market. All this would make for much more competitive marketing of Windward Island fruit. Simultaneously, other crops and livestock production could be introduced or expanded to provide additional new sources of export income as well as to increase food self-sufficiency. A dollar saved is a dollar earned Hugh Saul, Deputy Executive Director of CARDI, pointed out that while the Caribbean countries represented at this conference on agricultural diversification currently exported half a billion dollars worth of food products they imported twice as much. The production of food for local consumption was, he said, the greatest opportunity on the basis that a dollar saved is as good as a dollar earned. Many speakers agreed - from St Kitts-Nevis, Antigua, Belize, Guyana, Dominica, St Vincent, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. From Trinidad, Vishnu Ramlogan outlined the options being considered by Caroni (1975) Ltd. once an all-sugar company and now one that is looking to replace a substantial part of the cane acreage with citrus, coffee, mango, cashew and rice. Additionally, beef production (from the Buffalypso, a selected strain of water buffalo), sheep raising for meat, and culture of Malaysian prawns were set to increase. Industrial production of alcohol, charcoal and packaging board from bagasse, and even single-cell protein production from cane by-products were all being considered. No easy solution While the options are many, past experience has demonstrated that successful diversification programmes are developed only after research into all aspects of the husbandry of alternative crop or livestock enterprises and thorough investigation of potential markets. Angus Hone, plant commodities economist with Britain's ODNRI (Overseas Development Natural Resources Institute) suggested that Caribbean exports for newer crops such as fruit, vegetables and cut flowers would find more profitable markets more readily in North America than in Europe. Europe is both further in terms of transport and is already importing substantially from Israel, Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Thailand. Ghana's recent entry into pineapple exports demonstrates that skill more African producers are anxious to seek outlets in Europe. Meanwhile within the EC, Spain has planted very considerable acreages of avocado and is in a strong positron to supply sweet pepper and certain other exotic vegetables. Brazil is currently dominating world exports of citrus and papaya. Mr Hone's analysis is that there would be niche markets in Europe and off-season periods when Israel, Africa and Asia cannot supply and that Caribbean producers should seek these and develop them. There are also expatriate Caribbean communities in Europe, particularly Britain, which demand Caribbean foods such as tannia and eddo. There is also potential for cut flowers but only if aircraft space could be utilized more effectively. At present there is a surplus of space on European flights from Barbados but no effective freight feeder service from neighbouring countries to Barbados. The overall conclusion was that in most countries where sugar or bananas are the major crop, they will remain so because of their important role in the economy. The continuing commitment by the EC under the Lome Convention to import previously <b>agreed</b> <b>quantities</b> of these products from ACP countries will help secure those economies built on these products. Nevertheless, it is sound economics to develop additional sources of revenue. This can be achieved by improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of sugar and banana production, by making more cost-effective use of cane by-products and by developing appropriate new crops for additional income and for import substitution. Finally, the seminar stressed that the commitment of policy makers is essential if agricultural diversification is to be successful. The example of Mauritius is clear evidence of such support that has been maintained consistently over a long period of years. The Minister of Agriculture for Barbados, the Hon. Warwick Franklin, gave a clear lead to the future when he opened the conference saying, > And, comparing the relatively small nations of the region with the giant economies of North America, Latin America and Europe, he called for much greater cooperation among Caribbean countries. The new Agricultural Diversification Unit of OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) is an example of what could develop. As several participants remarked, agricultural diversification in the Caribbean may have been talked about for more than a century but never before has there been such urgency to select, implement and support the right policies in agriculture in the region. To a greater or lesser extent, many of the same comments could apply also to Africa and the Pacific.

In Malaysia, CF has been identified as a system capable of stimulating agricultural production and was given {{a central role in the}} latest strategy by government to improve the vegetable and fruit production. Approach: The overall objective of this study was to examine CF as the new marketing practice among selected vegetable and fruit suppliers. The specific objectives of the study were: (1) to examine the respondents perception towards CF; (2) to identify respondents practices toward the CF and (3) to suggest a policy to ensure the sustainability of CF. Results: Out of 208 of the total respondents selected in the study, 41 suppliers were involved in CF. The data were analyzed using SPSS to describe the respondents profile and current supply chain practices. At present, the suppliers have a contract agreement with Federal Agriculture Marketing Authority (FAMA) and FAMA has a contract agreement with Hypermarkets. It is presumed that there is a new supply chain network but the contract was not according to the FAO definition. The production and marketing contracts exist in non-formal or mainly verbal agreement. The production contract respondents also did not follow the criteria of CF. Conclusion: Because of this, all the non-formal production contracts in this survey are categorized into marketing contracts.

The proposed model shows that the coordination of the reorder point, together with order quantity, can increase the overall chain profitability as well as each member's profitability.

40|$|We {{present a}} unified {{description}} of temperature and entropy in spaces with either "true" or "accelerated observer" horizons: In their (higher dimensional) global embedding Minkowski geometries, the relevant detectors have constant accelerations a_G; {{associated with their}} Rindler horizons are temperature a_G/ 2 π and entropy equal to 1 / 4 the horizon area. Both <b>quantities</b> <b>agree</b> with those calculated in the original curved spaces. As one example of this equivalence, we obtain the temperature and entropy of Schwarzschild geometry from its flat D= 6 embedding.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the interaction effect between atoms and the finite size {{effect of a}} Bose-Einstein gas at finite temperature. Using a mean field approach, we derive the thermodynamic potential on finite systems and obtain the condensate fraction, the chemical potential and the internal energy with the interaction and the finite size effects taken into account. In this approach, we can treat thermodynamic quantities {{as those of the}} ideal Bose gas. It is found that the interaction effect shifts the transition temperature by a few percent toward the lower temperature. Above the transition temperature, these <b>quantities</b> <b>agree</b> with the noninteracting Bose gas. Comment: 5 pages, RevTeX, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Some {{examples}} of profiles of PBL quantities retrieved from Doppler radar and lidar observations are shown, {{and the extent}} to which the deduced <b>quantities</b> <b>agree</b> with the traditional eddy viscosity concept is examined. It is found in one case that the concept of 'top down bottom up' diffusion introduced by Wyngaard (1983) is more pertinent than that of the eddy viscosity. In another case it is found that, in stable layers with sufficiently large Richardson number, the momentum fluxes could be counter-gradient. In this latter case the use of a negative turbulence diffusion coefficient would result in an ill-posed differential equation, thus confusing the 'diffusion problem'...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} of Democratic Yemen started an essential drugs programme in 1984. Every month quantities of 30 drugs are delivered in prepacked kits to health units and standard treatment schedules have been <b>agreed.</b> The <b>quantities</b> of each drug were estimated {{by applying the}} standard treatment schedules to the typical morbidity patterns seen at these facilities. Most health workers attended a training course on the correct use of the standard treatment schedules. Hospital and health centres {{have been included in}} the programme to a more limited extent. In March 1988 an evaluation of the programme was carried out. Comparisons were made between random samples of health units included in the programme and those where it had not yet been implemented. The adequacy of knowledge necessary for reasonable use of drugs was assessed by interviewing health workers. Actual drug prescription was studied by means of quantitative indicators. A more qualitative insight was obtained by reviewing drug prescriptions for four tracer diseases at a sample of health centre and hospital out-patient departments. Health workers at units included in the programme had significantly (Pevaluation methods essential drugs drug prescription Democratic Yemen...|$|R
50|$|Ready... Break is {{the debut}} album by Something Corporate which was never commercially {{released}} {{and was only}} sold at their local performances in Southern California. It is essentially the band's major label demo recordings that were recorded at the newly opened recording room at the Galaxy Theatre. The sessions were intended {{to be limited to}} the recording and mixing of 3-4 songs but the sessions went so well that 10 songs were completed. The addition of a live version of Konstantine as a hidden track serves as track 11. The Coach House company, which owned the Galaxy Theatre, approached the band to release the recordings as a collected album on their independent label Coach House Records but the band was already in discussions with other labels and agreed on a version of the CD, with album cover artwork and graphic design by Damon Kidwell, which would expressly not include a bar code for retail sale. An <b>agreed</b> upon <b>quantity</b> of 2500 copies was pressed and sold only at their shows. Four years later, the CD was re-released by the band, exclusively to members of the official Something Corporate fan club, repackaged in a cardboard sleeve with alternative cover artwork.|$|R
40|$|Ferrenberg and Swendsen {{histogram}} {{method is}} based on Boltzmann probability distribution which presents exponentially decaying tails. Thus, it gives accurate measures only within a narrow window around the simulated temperature. The larger the system, the narrower this window, and the worst the performance of this method. We present a quite different approach, defining a non-biased random walk along the E axis with long range power-law decaying tails, and measuring directly the degeneracy g(E), without thermodynamic constraints. Our arguments are general (model independent), and the method is shown to be exact for the 1 D Ising ferromagnet. Also for the 2 D Ising ferromagnet, our numerical results for different thermodynamic <b>quantities</b> <b>agree</b> quite well with exact expressions. Comment: 9 pages, plain tex, 5 PS figures, WWW.

40|$|Starting from a {{microscopic}} model of self-propelled hard spheres we use tools of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of hard spheres to derive a Smoluchowski equation for interacting Active Brownian particles. We illustrate {{the utility of}} the statistical mechanics framework developed with two applications. First, we derive the steady state pressure of the hard sphere active fluid in terms of the microscopic parameters and second, we identify the critical density for the onset of motility-induced phase separation in this system. We show that both these <b>quantities</b> <b>agree</b> well with overdamped simulations of active Brownian particles with excluded volume interactions given by steeply repulsive potentials. The results presented here can be used to incorporate excluded volume effects in diverse models of self-propelled particles. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
