This study builds upon several theoretical models concerning program-induced moods in relation to viewer’s judgment to commercial advertisements. Findings from two studies suggest that program-induced mood systematically influences attitude toward the inserted ad with (vs. without) a five-second countdown: for the negative-affect program, attitude toward the <b>ad</b> <b>was</b> more positive when the <b>ad</b> <b>was</b> preceded by the countdown than when the <b>ad</b> <b>was</b> not preceded by the countdown.

5|$|<b>AD</b> <b>is</b> also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|Celsus (25 BC– AD 14) {{described}} ligation and excision procedures, {{and discussed}} the possible complications. Galen advocated severing {{the connection of}} the arteries to veins, claiming it reduced both pain {{and the spread of}} gangrene. The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century <b>AD)</b> <b>is</b> similar to the words of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness. In the 13th century, European surgeons such as Lanfranc of Milan, Guy de Chauliac, Henri de Mondeville, and John of Ardene made great progress and development of the surgical techniques.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

5|$|The oldest, {{on which}} most {{currently}} available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes that <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> caused by reduced {{synthesis of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.|$|E

5|$|The 400-year {{period from}} the 9th to 13th centuries AD was the Islamic Renaissance, {{a time when}} Islamic culture and science thrived.

Chandola Lake covers an area of 1200 hectares. It is home for cormorants, painted storks and spoonbills. During the evening time, many people visit this place and take a leisurely stroll. There is a recently developed Naroda lake and the world's largest collection of antique cars in KathWada at IB farm (Dastan Farm). AMC has also developed the Sabarmati Riverfront.|$|E

The winnowing fan was first described by the Tang Dynasty writer and linguist Yan Shigu (581–645), in his commentary on the Jijiupian dictionary written earlier in 40 BC by Shi Yu; it was also mentioned in a poem by the Song Dynasty artist Mei Yaochen in about 1060. The earliest known drawn illustration of the winnowing fan comes from the Book of Agriculture published in 1313 by Yuan dynasty inventor and politician Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333).|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{consequent}} Roman efforts to subjugate all of Germania, the member tribes of the Suebi alliance became displaced, moved east, conquered the Celtic tribes that stood in their way and settled, the Quadi in Moravia, and the Marcomanni in Bohemia. The latter tribe, under Marbod, formed a quasi-state with a huge army and was able to conquer the Lugii tribal association among others. What archeologists see as the Przeworsk culture, by this period (early 1st century <b>AD)</b> <b>is</b> believed to consist first of all of the Lugii tribes. A Roman defeat in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (9 AD) stabilized the situation at the periphery of the Empire to some degree. The Lugii and other tribes on Polish lands increasingly became involved in trade and other contacts, through the Marcomanni and Quadi intermediaries, with the Danubian provinces of Rome. The Lugii, according to Tacitus, was a very large union of tribes. In 50 AD they invaded and pillaged the Quadi state created by Vannius, contributing to its fall. The motivation for the expedition were the rumours of the enormous riches that Vannius had accumulated by plunder and charging duties. In 93 AD the Lugii, fighting a war with the Suebi, asked Emperor Domitian for help, and received one hundred mounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II {{constructed}} {{at least}} five known stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40. Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were all erected in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, which was erected in August of 731 <b>AD,</b> <b>is</b> of the niche variety, meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche, and it was erected to commemorate the accession {{of the individual to}} the position of ajaw. The monument shows the ajaw flanked by subjects, witnesses to the ceremonies explored {{on the face of the}} stela. The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as a space for offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human near the bottom of the monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on the upper right have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E
