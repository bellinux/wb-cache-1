After all, Arafat is already older than King Husayn of Jordan and Hafiz al-Asad of Syria were {{at the time of}} their deaths in recent years, and <b>Arafat</b> <b>has</b> suffered from a number of physical ailments, particularly since his near-fatal plane crash in Libya. In addition to the ravages of time, Arafat must also worry about assassination attempts, either from Palestinian dissidents or Israeli commandos. Even as the siege of Arafat is coming to an end, the questions of his physical longevity and of political succession in Palestine only intensify. The intent of this essay is not to predict which personality will eventually succeed Arafat, but rather to outline some of the major issues that will define the succession process when it occurs...|$|E
40|$|PALESTINIAN STATE-BUILDING PERFORMANCE Challenges of {{national}} integration between the West Bank and Gaza Strip The peace process between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel established, {{for the first}} time in modern history, a Palestinian National Authority (PA) in parts of the Palestinian territory. Given the strong regional cleavages between the West Bank and Gaza, this study investigates what difficulties regional cleavages presents to national integration in the Palestinian state-building project. Using a model derived from Stein Rokkan's models of state-building, this study investigates the first phasw of system building, where the physical power apparatus is the most important sector to be built. Can a common Palestinian political entity be created out of two separate and distinct entities that differ economically, culturally, legally and administratively? Looking into the organisation and operation of the Palestinian police and security forces and the legal system, it can be found evidence that the West Bank and Gaza experience the PA's consolidation of power differently. Next: what is the extent and nature of the opposition to the state-building elite? How <b>Arafat</b> <b>has</b> gotten control over the opposition to the state-building process, namely Hamas and to some extent the civil society, building new alliances and elites, has been a part of penetrating the PA's power throughout the Palestinian territories. The last chapter identifies different regional state-building centers in the West Bank and Gaza. To sum up the discussion on the PA's state-building performance, penetrating the society very much became an issue of controlling Hamas. Further, the PA's consolidation of power was carried out differenlty between the two regions, as the institution-building for the Palestinian police was carried out...|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{diagnosing}} and treating cancer, early detection is important. While other cancers can be identified through routine screenings, pancreatic cancer has been notoriously difficult to diagnose early. After pancreatic cancer is diagnosed, the optimal course of treatment is not always clear. Hwyda Arafat, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Surgery at Thomas Jefferson University and co-director of the Jefferson Pancreatic, Biliary and Related Cancers Center, and Jordan M. Winter, MD, Assistant Professor of Surgery, are working to change that. Together with Mon-Li Chu, PhD, Professor and Vice Chair of the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Biology, Dr. <b>Arafat</b> <b>has</b> identified a protein – Collagen 6 A 3 – that is highly expressed in cancerous pancreatic tissue and can be identified through a noninvasive blood test. Based on their initial findings, Dr. Arafat and Dr. Chu were awarded a $ 200, 000 grant from the University City Science Center’s QED Proof of Concept Program. The team is using the money to validate their initial findings and to begin commercializing the test – “The COL 6 A 3 Panel” – which is poised {{to become the first}} clinically reliable test for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. “We are exploring how this test could be used to monitor high-risk patient groups, such as those with chronic pancreatitis and those with a family history of pancreatic cancer,” Dr. Arafat explains. “This noninvasive test could also help in differentiating between malignant and benign tumors identified in imaging studies, and could be used to monitor pancreatic cancer patients as they undergo treatment. ” As Dr. Arafat works to develop a screening test, Dr. Winter is working to identify more effective prognostic tools. His work has explored the linkage between two proteins, MUC- 1 and mesothelin, and pancreatic tumors with particularly aggressive biology. More specifically, Dr. Winter and his team are exploring a possible correlation between CA 15 - 3, a serum marker already used in treating patients with metastatic breast and ovarian cancer, and high expression of MUC- 1. “No one had looked at using CA 15 - 3 in patients with pancreatic cancer, probably because this marker won’t be elevated in all pancreatic cancer patients,” Dr. Winter explains. “However, if we find a reliable correlation between CA 15 - 3 and MUC- 1, testing CA 15 - 3 levels may have a role in pancreatic cancer treatment. ” What’s more, Dr. Winter is collaborating with Jonathan R. Brody, PhD, J. Wallace Davis and Gail G. Davis Professor of Surgery, to research gene therapies targeting pancreatic cancer at a molecular level: “What we imagine is a clinical paradigm where we can identify which patients are most appropriate for gene therapy {{based on the results of}} their serum test,” Dr. Winter says.
