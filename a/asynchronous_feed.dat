5000|$|In a {{study of}} A. tonsa in the Narragansett Bay the species was found to exhibit a diel feeding pattern, that is, a night feeding pattern. The diel feeding cycle was tested {{under a variety of}} light {{conditions}} and was found to be endogenous, not related to light availability, but persistent regardless of whether the copepods were subjected to light or dark. This feeding pattern is only known to be disrupted at extremely low food levels implying that either “food limitation has over-ridden other factors governing diel feeding rhythms and induced continuous feeding, or that a synchronized population-wide feeding rhythm has given way to intermittent, <b>asynchronous</b> <b>feeding</b> among individuals.” ...|$|R

The proposed VF controller is used to control the frequency and voltage of an IAG with load leveling.

Often the colour appearance of a person can provide enough information to identify an object or person in the short-term.

Mathematical modeling of dynamic modes of asynchronous motors with lateral capacitor compensation of reactive power. Results. The calculation algorithm and results of mathematic modeling of processes during starting modes of <b>asynchronous</b> motor <b>feeding</b> from the network through capacitors connected in series are presented. It is shown that for some values of capacitance the self-excitation processes and subharmonic oscillations can appear. Scientific novelty. Mathematic modeling and research of processes in asynchronous motor under its feeding through capacitors is carried {{out for the first}} time. The calculation algorithm is based on the mathematical model of asynchronous motor with high level of adequacy, which takes into account the magnetic core saturation and the current displacement in limbs of the rotor. Practical implication.

40|$|Starting {{synchronous}} motors can {{be achieved}} by several ethods: starting with an auxiliary motor launch, starting in <b>asynchronous</b> regim, by <b>feeding</b> from a variable frequency source, auto-synchronization with the network [...] In our case we study the transient processes in a asynchronous regim. In this case the synchronous motor is started like a squirrel cage induction motor. To start, the synchronous motor is equipped with a starting winding cage placed in the pole pieces of polar inducers; later, during the operation, this acts as a damping winding. Large synchronous motors have pole pieces made from massive polar inducers fulfilling the role of a cage winding...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{simulate}} the model of a self-excited <b>asynchronous</b> generator (SEASG) <b>feeding</b> R L load in conjunction with an AC/DC/AC converter fed RLC series circuit connected at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). Simulation model of the proposed system has been developed by using Matlab/Simulink. The result shows that the effect of RLC series circuit when operated at variable frequency affects the generation voltage profile. This reflects that an additional capacitance or inductance effect is possible to inject when the RLC is operated at a frequency lower or higher than the resonance frequency. This simulation model validates that the injections of capacitance in a SEASG are possible to match the lagging reactive power of the RL load to maintain a constant voltage at the load bus.

40|$|Traditional {{classrooms}} {{accompanied by}} face-to-face interaction among {{students and faculty}} members, lectures, text and other readings, experiential learning through actual field trips and case studies are components of traditional course delivery systems. For most faculty, those were the structures used for the faculty member's studies prior to teaching. Increasingly, schools are delivering course materials using the distributed learning technologies. Those technologies include using synchronous learning tools, such as interactive live video <b>feeds,</b> <b>asynchronous</b> learning tools, such as taped lectures, and &quot;quasi-synchronous &quot; tools such as discussion boards (threaded discussions) and virtual classrooms. This paper discusses the different technologies, their relationship to different learning styles and one example of using such technologies to delivery a completely online, internet-based course. It concludes with recommendations to faculty members who may use components {{or all of the}} technologies currently available.

40|$|Topside Variable Speed Drive (VSD) {{feeding a}} subsea load via a long cable {{is not a}} new {{technological}} challenge and many features in systems <b>feeding</b> <b>asynchronous</b> machines are well known. For a synchronous machine the situation is different as a net positive machine torque is not guaranteed. Therefor an analysis of the start sequence of such machine is of interest. In this work starting of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) powered by a VSD via a long subsea cable have been studied. Long transfer distance gives need for increased cable voltage, and thus transformers are introduced. A dynamic simulation model has been developed in SIMULINK? SimPowerSystems? consisting of voltage source, saturable transformers, cable, machine and mechanical load. To synchronize the machine the electrical frequency is lowered as suggested in literature with the result that the system impedances change compared to steady state and resistance become the dominant parameter. Source voltage amplitude must also be reduced accordingly to avoid iron core saturation. The consequence is that the large cable voltage drop result in insufficient start up torque produced by the machine when a stiction torque around 30 % is present. The mentioned dynamic simulation model has been used to compare system modifications proposed in literature to an unmodified base case with a cable length of 50 km. This have been done to investigate how stiction torque affects the start sequence and to draw conclusions about which method gives the most benefits for this type of machine. The main cases tested are increased voltage/frequency ratio, reduced cable resistance and machine damping. If the electromagnetic torque produced overcomes stiction torque the rotor is set into motion. Because of the rotor and load inertia and the high opposing friction torque rotor oscillations around zero speed is not avoided for any of the cases when stiction torque is applied. Oscillation motion is assumed to heat up the bearing oil such that the static torque is reduced and eventually synchronous operation is achieved after several seconds. It is shown in this work that what separates the cases where sufficient torque is produced is the time the machine uses to reach synchronism. All modifications shows improvement compared to the base case. Damping and voltage boost are the modifications with the most promising results for a broad range of stiction torques. This is expected as damping gives a net positive torque as in an induction machine, and that voltage boost directly increases the machine current. Higher voltage boost is better, but may easily lead to transformer saturation so this method must be used with great care. A rotor design with very high damping may result in a machine with lower air gap magnetic flux and conversely lower electromagnetic torque. The tradeoff between the modifications must be considered for each specific system. Oscillations are found to be present to the same degree independent of initial power angle. This means that as long as no dynamic control strategy is applied one does not {{have to take into account}} the initial angle of the rotor relative to the stator field. The assumption about reduction in static friction in the mechanical load should be tested in laboratory or existing installations. No cost- or sizing considerations are included in this work. In relation to offshore installations space requirements may often be an issue, but this has to be considered in each specific case. Resonance conditions must be treated with great care in such system and could be subject for further studies. Off special interest are multilevel inverters producing a very low harmonic output. A great challenge is to achieve general results and models that may be part of a tool box for system development in the future. The model developed here may be a part of such tools...|$|R
