In the complex predicate, an IA head functions as a matrix predicate and introduces an applied object for the secondary predicate to be predicated of. Nonetheless, <b>a</b> <b>double</b> applicative differs from <b>a</b> <b>double</b> transitive in that (i) it sets an IA in its I-function rather than in its T-function; (ii) it advances as the trigger a genuine IO instead of an IO in the disguise of a DO.|$|R

5|$|Saudi Arabia {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} and most undeveloped {{countries}} in the world when oil was discovered in the late 1930s. The country therefore needed foreign expertise and labour to exploit its vast oil reserves. As a result, in the years after World War II there was a growth in the numbers of foreign technical, professional and administrative personnel, mainly from other Middle Eastern countries but also supplied by Western oil companies, many of whom worked for ARAMCO (Arabian-American Oil Company). A much greater increase in the numbers of foreign workers came with the oil-price boom following the 1973 oil crisis. Infrastructure and development plans led to an influx of skilled and unskilled workers, principally Palestinians, Egyptians, Yemenis and others from Arab countries, but also Indians and Pakistanis, leading to <b>a</b> <b>doubling</b> of the Saudi population by 1985.

5|$|Headlam was {{promoted}} to substantive air commodore on 1January 1955. In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, and the following year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College. Returning to Australia, he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air, Canberra, from 19March to 21October 1957, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred Scherger and Allan Walters, and again from 24August 1959 to 28March 1960, between the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal Bill Hely. In this role Headlam occupied {{a seat on the}} Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee, chaired by businessman William John Allison, examining conditions of defence service; the committee's recommendations led to <b>a</b> <b>doubling</b> of flight pay, among other improvements. Headlam's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959, and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959. The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF's Directorate of Intelligence. Headlam was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours, gazetted on 3June. In May 1960 he became acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{generally}} {{performed well}} {{at the end of}} the medieval period, helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods. Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself, leading to <b>a</b> <b>doubling</b> of prices. Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically, but picked up again over the next few years. By the turn of the 16th century, the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline, leading to the commencement of bell and surface mining to support the tin boom that had occurred in the late 15th century. Lead mining increased, and output almost doubled between 1300 and 1500. Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death, and coal production declined as a result, remaining depressed for the rest of the period – nonetheless, some coal production was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century. Iron production continued to increase; the Weald in the South-East began to make increased use of water-power, and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England's main iron-producing region. The first blast furnace in England, a major technical step forward in metal smelting, was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald.|$|E
