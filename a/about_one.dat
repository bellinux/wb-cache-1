To investigate this issue, we use a longitudinal dataset from rural Malawi that combines innovative probabilistic expectations about HIV infection with a randomized design for HIV testing to investigate whether providing an individual with infor-mation about his/her HIV status results in more accurate beliefs about his/her own infection status two years after the HIV test. We find that learning <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> HIV-positive status has no impact on medium-term subjective beliefs <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> own HIV infection. We also show that learning one’s HIV-negative status results in higher subsequent beliefs <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> own infec-tion, as well as larger prediction errors <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> HIV status...|$|R

Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae <b>about</b> <b>one</b> week after the initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of lying <b>about</b> <b>one's</b> attitudes (attitude dissimulation) on various strength-related consequences for weakly held attitudes. Dissimulation for weak attitudes could either produce a strengthening effect on the underlying attitude (if lying involves activation of the true attitude) or a weakening effect (if lying sets up a competing link to the false attitude). Results from three experiments using different dissimulation paradigms support the strengthening hypothesis. Lying <b>about</b> <b>one's</b> attitudes increases accessibility of the attitude, {{as well as its}} persistence and correspondence with behavior. These findings provide evidence for the far-ranging consequences of lying <b>about</b> <b>one's</b> attitudes. Other implications and opportunities for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Worrying <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> job, family, {{financial}} situation and health is distressing. How intense are these worries {{in the general}} population?Methods: An inquiry representative of the German population (N= 2473, age> 14 years) was performed. The total score of the “Questionnaire for Assessing Subjective Physical Well-Being“ (FEW) and the screening scale of the “Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress“ (TICS) were correlated with the four above mentioned items addressing worries (range 1 - 4). Results: Worries <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> {{financial situation}} were scored highest (mean= 2. 04, SD= 0. 92), followed by worries <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> health (mean= 1. 94; SD= 0. 87), one’s family (mean= 1. 85; SD= 0. 86) and worries <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> job (mean= 1. 69; SD= 0. 92). Health worries increased with age. Those without a job and single parents showed the highest grades of solicitude. Increasing income decreased worrying. The correlations with chronic stress were moderate (. 24 <r<. 33). The most significant correlation could be found between worries <b>about</b> <b>one’s</b> health and the total score of the FEW (r=-. 52). Conclusions: The general population’s concerns are relatively low. Using normative data, people can be screened for psychosocial distress and possibly referred to a relevant form of psychosocial support...|$|R
