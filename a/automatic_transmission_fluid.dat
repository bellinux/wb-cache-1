2500|$|The G20 {{featured}} {{either a}} 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 4-speed automatic. [...] Most {{front wheel drive}} transmissions from other SR-powered cars {{can be used with}} few modifications. The stock transmission as well as other SR20 transmissions are often upgraded with various modifications in order to handle more power. Common manual transmission modifications include cryo treating, shot peening, transmission case welding, aftermarket limited slip differential, aftermarket axles, and upgraded clutches. Common automatic transmission modifications include built valve bodies, aftermarket torque converters, <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> (ATF) coolers, additional ATF filters, and aftermarket TCUs. Higher rated transmission swaps from front-wheel drive VQ or QR25DE powered cars such as the 2002–2006 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec-V have also been performed.|$|E
2500|$|Powertrain {{design was}} reassessed for {{front-wheel-drive}} and this generated {{a foundation for}} which other models were developed. The transaxle is connected inline with the engine, {{and to create a}} simple and compact structure, a single rail system that replaces the three shafts normally used for each gear range with a single shaft, was adopted. In addition, <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> was used for the lubricating oil in order to reduce friction. Existing gasoline S- and diesel C-series engines were converted for use in transverse applications.

2500|$|In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed {{longitudinal}} S tronic {{version of}} the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates — the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system [...] — Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits. One oil circuit, consisting of , lubricates the hydraulic clutches and mechatronics with fully synthetic specialist <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> (ATF), whilst the other oil circuit lubricates the gear trains and front and centre differentials with [...] of conventional hypoid gear oil. This dual circuit lubrication is aimed at increasing overall reliability, due to eliminating cross-contamination of debris and wear particles. It has a torque handling limit of up to , and engine power outputs of up to [...] It has a total mass, including all lubricants and the dual-mass flywheel of [...]|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{lubricating}} {{oils and}} their additives for Ni, Zn, Mg and Ca {{was carried out}} by the proposed method using benzene-acetic acid/methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) mixed solvent system. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry using air-acetylene flame was employed with the incorporation of concentrated hydrochloric acid into the solvent mixture. The large dilution of samples employed due to flexible working range of this procedure eliminates the need for matched standard hence the same standards are adequate for all types of lubricating oil samples and additives.

50|$|The {{radiator}} transfers {{the heat}} from the fluid inside to the air outside, thereby cooling the fluid, which in turn cools the engine. Radiators are also often used to cool <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>fluids,</b> air conditioner refrigerant, intake air, and sometimes to cool motor oil or power steering fluid. Radiators are typically mounted {{in a position where they}} receive airflow from the forward movement of the vehicle, such as behind a front grill. Where engines are mid- or rear-mounted, it is common to mount the radiator behind a front grill to achieve sufficient airflow, even though this requires long coolant pipes. Alternatively, the radiator may draw air from the flow over the top of the vehicle or from a side-mounted grill. For long vehicles, such as buses, side airflow is most common for engine and transmission cooling and top airflow most common for air conditioner cooling.|$|R

50|$|In 1991, Cadillac added a power-latching {{mechanism}} for the convertible top, and the digital instrument cluster, featured in all but 275 Allanté models this year, was repriced (it was now a $495 option for the convertible model). Prices began at $57,260, although a midyear price-drop brought the Allanté convertible down to $55,900, and the hardtop/convertible down to $61,450 (from $62,810). Allanté had 16.3 cubic feet of storage (when utilizing the pass-through compartment into the cabin area). Of the 1,928 models produced for 1991, only seven were manufactured for export - five to Canada, one to Italy, and another to Puerto Rico. Canadian models offered a kilometer-based instrument cluster, daytime running lamps, and an engine block heater as standard equipment, while the Italian model featured a list of European-mandated modifications, including breakaway side mirrors, specific European headlamps and turn signals, a front tow hook, rear fog lamps, deletion of the deck-lid mounted center brake light, a wet-arm windshield washer system, coolers for the power steering and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>fluids,</b> and a revised steering column {{to compensate for the}} removal of the driver's airbag.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{was invented}} in 1921 by Alfred Horner Munro of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and {{patented}} under Canadian patent CA 235757 in 1923. (Munro obtained UK patent GB215669 215,669 for his invention in 1924 and US patent 1,613,525 on 4 January 1927). Being a steam engineer, Munro designed his device to use compressed air rather than hydraulic fluid, and so it lacked power and never found commercial application. The first <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> using hydraulic <b>fluid</b> may have been developed in 1932 by two Brazilian engineers, José Braz Araripe and Fernando Lehly Lemos; subsequently the prototype and plans were sold to General Motors who introduced it in the 1940 Oldsmobile as the [...] "Hydra-Matic" [...] transmission. They were incorporated into GM-built tanks during World War II and, after the war, GM marketed them as being [...] "battle-tested." [...] However, a Wall Street Journal article credits ZF Friedrichshafen with the invention, occurring shortly after World War I. ZFs origins were in manufacturing gears for airship engines beginning in 1915; the company was founded by Ferdinand von Zeppelin.|$|R
50|$|A {{redesign}} of the manual transmission's cable actuator solved the shift-quality issue, while a new Aisin Warner <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> replaced the somewhat unreliable Renault unit which {{was well known}} to dump its <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> on the road generally without prior warning.

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the impeller inside the torque converter, the pump is typically a gear pump mounted between the torque converter and the planetary gearset. It draws <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> from a sump and pressurizes it, which is needed for transmission components to operate. The input for the pump is connected to the torque converter housing, which in turn is bolted to the engine's flexplate, so the pump provides pressure whenever the engine is running and there is enough <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid,</b> but the disadvantage is that when the engine is not running, no oil pressure is available to operate the main components of the transmission, and is thus impossible to push-start a vehicle equipped with an <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Early <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> also had a rear pump for towing purposes, ensuring the lubrication of the rear-end components.|$|R

50|$|Dexron-II was {{introduced}} in 1972 with alternative friction modifiers such as Jojoba oil. However, it caused problems with corrosion-prone solder in GM's <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> coolers; accordingly, corrosion inhibitors {{were added to the}} product. The resultant fluid, released in 1975, was called Dexron-IID. However, the corrosion inhibitor made the new fluid hygroscopic, which while it was not a major problem in <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> made Dexron IID unsuitable for other hydraulic systems in which it was commonly used. A further reformulation, to address excessive hygroscopicity, but primarily to improve low temperature performance (20,000cP @ -40C vs 50,000cP@-40C for Dexron-IID) was named Dexron-IIE (GM Spec GM6137M).|$|R

40|$|In Malaysia, public {{transportation}} {{has become the}} main way for citizen to go {{from one place to}} another. One of the popular and yet the very important ways of {{public transportation}} is the bus. Ease of availability, cheap and fast were the reasons why people choose bus in comparison to other means of public transport. In order to maintain the bus life span {{so that it can be}} used for a long time without any major problem; the bus should be maintained and serviced according to its mileage usage. Thus, this research focuses on the analysis of <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> sample by using experimental approach after a certain mileage. The objectives of this work are to collect the oil sample from <b>automatic</b> and manual <b>transmission</b> systems of engine bus according to manufacturer's recommendations, to analyse collected oil sample using oil analysis technique i. e. ferrographic, FTIR, AES and to predict the wear morphology, spectral outcomes and wear element concentration from the oil analysis results. The sample <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> which was taken from the <b>automatic</b> and manual <b>transmission</b> gearbox has been experimentally analyzed. The oil sample were taken with an interval of 5, 000 km, 30, 000 km, 50, 000 km, 80, 000 km, 180, 000 km and 300, 000 km for <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> bus operation, and 5, 000 km, 50, 000 km, 100, 000 km, 150, 000 km and 200, 000 km for manual transmission bus operation. This sample then has been analyzed by comparing between new and used <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> using FM-III Ferrogram Maker, FTIR and spectrometer. Oil analysis by ferrographic, FTIR and spectrometric technique is a form of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to avoid major failure in machine elements. Most machine elements are not easily accessible in the transmission system. Having a reliable technique would avoid the needs to open the components unnecessarily, hence, help to prevent catastrophic failure which are very costly, and ease of regular monitoring. In order to identify the major failures of automatic gearbox, forecasts can be made regarding the lube <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> analysis test. By using these test, the minor problem can be determine before become into major failures.
