5|$|The Tongan Meteorological Service {{reported}} {{that some of}} its property and equipment had been damaged. The property damage had an <b>approximate</b> <b>value</b> of about $2,000 (2009TOP, $1,0002009 USD). This included a Stevenson screen, office guttering, a HF radio antennae, signal processor, and satellite receiver. They also {{reported that}} the National weather forecasting center in Fua’amotu had experienced power failure on April 4 at 1600 UTC; for this reason the center operated using a small portable generator until early {{the next day when}} they stopped issuing warnings as Lin was no longer a threat to Tonga. Power was eventually restored later that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an <b>approximate</b> <b>value</b> for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over {{as little as a}} hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E

40|$|The best-fit {{values of}} the Michaelis {{constant}} (Km) and the maximum velocity (V) in the Michaelis-Menten equation {{can be obtained by}} the method of least squares with the Taylor expansion for the sum of squares of the absolute residual, i. e., the difference between the observed velocity and the corresponding velocity by calculation. This method makes it possible to determine the values of Km and V not in a trial-and-error manner but in a deductive and unique manner after some iterative procedures starting from arbitrary <b>approximate</b> <b>values</b> of Km and V. These values can be said to be uniquely determined for a set of data as the finally converged values are no longer dependent upon the initial <b>approximate</b> <b>values</b> of Km and V. It is also very important to obtain initial <b>approximate</b> <b>values</b> of parameters for the application of the method described above. A simple method is proposed to estimate the <b>approximate</b> <b>values</b> of parameters involved in fractional functions. The method of rearrangement after canceling the denominator of a fractional function can be utilized to obtain <b>approximate</b> <b>values,</b> not only for cases of two unknown parameters such as the Michaelis-Menten equation, but also for cases with more than tw...|$|R

25|$|Using {{the left}} {{end of each}} piece, the {{rectangle}} method sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width, , here 0.25, to get an <b>approximate</b> <b>value</b> of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 218 pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.|$|E
25|$|After the Volta Associates gave several {{demonstrations in}} the City of Washington, {{businessmen}} from Philadelphia created the American Graphophone Company on March 28, 1887, {{in order to}} produce the machines for the budding phonograph marketplace. The Volta Graphophone Company then merged with American Graphophone, which itself later evolved into Columbia Records (co-founded CBS, and now part of the Sony media empire). Bell's portion of the share exchange at that time had an <b>approximate</b> <b>value</b> of US$200,000 (half of the total received by all of the Associates), $100,000 of which he soon dedicated to the newly formed Volta Bureau's research and pedagogical programs for the deaf.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive {{type of body}} fat meter uses the principle of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{in order to determine}} an individual's body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an <b>approximate</b> <b>value</b> for the person's body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis.|$|E
