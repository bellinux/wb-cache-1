25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the <b>avalanche</b> <b>effect.</b> This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E

40|$|Firstly, {{this study}} {{introduces}} {{a definition of}} generalized stability (GST) in discrete-time nonautonomous chaos system (DNCS), which is an extension for chaos generalized synchronization. Secondly, a constructive theorem of DNCS has been proposed. As an example, a GST DNCS is constructed based on a novel 4 -dimensional discrete chaotic map. Numerical simulations show that the dynamic behaviors of this map have chaotic attractor characteristics. As one application, we design a chaotic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) based on the GST DNCS. We use the SP 800 - 22 test suite to test the randomness of four 100 -key streams consisting of 1, 000, 000 bits generated by the CPRNG, the RC 4 algorithm, the ZUC algorithm, and a 6 -dimensional CGS-based CPRNG, respectively.

40|$|To realize optimum performance, SiGe HBTs are {{typically}} designed with heavily doped implanted collectors. For practical circuits operating at either high collector current density (Jc) or high collector-base voltage (Vcb) avalanche multiplication {{is an important}} effects that must be accurately measured and modeled. For example in digital applications, the avalanche multiplication factor (M- 1) determines the breakdown voltage, which in turn determines the maximum power supply for stable logic operation. In critical RF circuits such as power amplifiers (PA) and low noise amplifiers (LNA), the base-collector junction avalanche multiplication degrades the linearity of the circuit because of the resulting strong non-linear feedback from the output (collector) to input (base) is particularly the case for state-of-art high-performance transistors featuring high collector doping. Therefore the accuracy of avalanche multiplication models in different operational conditions is critical to devices design of high linearity LNA and PA circuits. In this thesis, the temperature dependence of the avalanche current in Mextram compact model is addressed through extensive DC measurements over temperature on advanced industrial SiGe HBTs, {{it was discovered that}} the current local-electric field based avalanche current model in the Mextram model is incapable of describing the avalanche current as a function of device temperature. This setback is the key motivation behind the work in this thesis. By employing the simplified energy-balance equation, the impact ionization rate was expressed in terms of the carrier (electron for NPN HBT) energy or temperature (Te). Here a triangular shaped electric field distribution corresponding to the normal forward operation regime was assumed. Taking the integral of the electron temperature dependent ionization rate over the epilayer yielded the non-local multiplication factor. The product of the multiplication factor with epilayer current gives the non-local avalanche current, which takes non-local <b>avalanche</b> <b>effects</b> into account. The compact formulation of this non-local avalanche current model was derived and implemented at Delft University of Technology in the in-house version of Mextram compact model. An extended experimental verification of the new compact model for the non-local avalanche current implemented in Mextram was carried out for different advanced SiGe HBT technologies; and the results are presented in this thesis. Verification results showed that the non-local avalanche current model can accurately describe the avalanche current as a function of temperature for different SiGe HBTs (both NPN and PNP). These results implies that the observed setback in Mextram model with respect to the temperature dependence of the avalanche current can be fully addressed by taking non-local <b>avalanche</b> <b>effects</b> into account.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{theoretical and}} numerical {{analysis of the}} electrothermal behavior of single-finger bipolar transistors is proposed. Two models of different complexities are introduced to investigate self-heating effects in bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) biased with a constant base–emitter voltage source or with a constant base current source. In the constant base–emitter voltage case, simple relations are derived for determining {{the onset of the}} flyback behavior in the output characteristics which defines the boundary of the safe operating region. The model indicates that the flyback behavior disappears at high BE values, and predicts a thermal hysteresis phenomenon at high currents. It is also shown that at high current levels the electrothermal behavior is dominated by ohmic base pushout. If a constant base current is applied, the model shows that both BJTs and HBTs are unconditionally thermally stable. The transient behavior is also considered, and the temperature evolution is investigated for different bias conditions. The model shows that, if the device is biased in the thermally unstable region, thermal breakdown occurs within a finite time instant in the limit case of a zero ballast resistance. Finally, the reduction in the safe operating area due to <b>avalanche</b> <b>effects</b> and to the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity is discussed, and a simplified model is proposed...|$|R
