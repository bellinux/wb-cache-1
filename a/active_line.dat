40|$|Digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) {{data rates}} for short loops are typically limited by crosstalk between adjacent lines {{rather than by}} background noise. Precoding can reduce crosstalk in the downstream from the access node to the customer premises equipment significantly if an accurate estimate of the inverse crosstalk channel is provided. Recently, a backward-compatible method has been proposed for estimating downstream crosstalk channels using standardized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reports. This paper develops a probabilistic model of the estimation process and, within this model, provides conditions under which successive updates of the precoder are guaranteed to converge to the ideal inverse precoder. Bounds on estimator variance and convergence times are obtained and optimized with respect to system parameters. The analysis {{can be applied to}} the situation in which a new line is being activated and added to a group of precoded lines seamlessly, that is, with controlled impact on the SNR of the <b>active</b> <b>lines.</b> Two phases are proposed to achieve seamless activation; the protection phase is used to let the <b>active</b> <b>lines</b> learn the crosstalk from the activating line and the acquisition phase is used to let the activating line learn the crosstalk from the <b>active</b> <b>lines.</b> Results of the analysis are illustrated by numerical simulations. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} bundled ADSL systems and proposes an extension to their bit-loading mechanism that results to fair allocation of the available bandwidth. The "ratemaximization" bit-loading method provides less average data rate compared to the optimum "target-rate" strategy, which depends {{on the number of}} <b>active</b> <b>lines</b> in the system and the length of the DSL loop. Under a non-cooperative bit-loading approach, the total data rate is not distributed uniformly among the different <b>active</b> <b>lines.</b> The individual data rate depends on the activation time of each modem relative to the total number of lines in the system. The proposed bit-loading mechanism is applied to the downstream ADSL traffic, is executed by a management unit of the central office, uses the results of the single-user bit-loading mechanism and leads to fair data rate distribution...|$|R
