25|$|There {{are three}} types of antonyms: graded <b>antonyms,</b> {{complementary}} <b>antonyms</b> and relational <b>antonyms.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Universal reduplicated plural and {{inverted}} <b>antonyms</b> are {{reminiscent of}} the musical language Solresol.|$|E
25|$|Other antonymic words {{tend to have}} a {{different}} scope. For example, instead of malbona (bad) we may see aĉa (of poor quality) or fia (shameful), but these are not strict <b>antonyms.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1930 the SAT {{was first}} split into the verbal and math sections, a {{structure}} that would continue through 2004. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range of content than its predecessors, examining only <b>antonyms,</b> double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In 1936, analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and 1946, students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on <b>antonyms).</b> The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to 1941, like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in 1942, it consisted of multiple choice questions.|$|E
25|$|People {{sometimes}} {{object to}} using the prefix mal- to derive highly frequent <b>antonyms,</b> especially when they are as long as malproksima (far). There are a few alternative roots in poetry, such as turpa for malbela (ugly) and pigra for mallaborema (lazy) – some of which originated in Ido – that {{find their way into}} prose. However, they are rarely used in conversation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{administration}} of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it {{was known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of definitions, arithmetic, classification, artificial language, <b>antonyms,</b> number series, analogies, logical inference, and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to Yale University and Smith College. The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. The raw score of each participating student was converted to a score scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This scale was effectively equivalent to a 200 to 800 scale, although students could score more than 800 and less than 200.|$|E

500|$|Consistent {{with the}} song title, the lyrics {{comprise}} a series of <b>antonyms</b> – such as yes–no, black–white and stay–go. With the narrative perspective alternating between first and second person, the composition also recalls George and Ira Gershwin's [...] "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off".|$|E
500|$|Written {{in the key}} of G major, [...] "Hot n Cold" [...] is a pop and dance-pop song which {{utilizes}} {{guitars and}} synthesizers. It has a length of three minutes and forty seconds (3:40), and runs at a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. The lyrics of the song address a lover of Perry whose mood swings are affecting the couple's relationship. The song opens with Perry confronting her former partner over his frequent changes of mind, singing [...] "You change your mind like a girl changes clothes / Yeah you PMS like a bitch". In the chorus, she uses <b>antonyms</b> to describe her partner's mood changes, with the chorus of the song including the lines [...] "You're hot then you're cold / You're yes then you're no / You're in then you're out / You're up then you're down".|$|E
500|$|Perry filmed a {{performance}} of {{a version of the}} song with puppet character Elmo from Sesame Street, which was intended to teach children about <b>antonyms.</b> The clip was originally scheduled to run on the 41st-season premiere of the educational children's program on September 27, 2010, however the performance, which was uploaded to YouTube earlier, garnered controversy over the amount of cleavage Perry had on display in the video. Before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that after controversy over the clip, [...] "We have decided we will not air the segment on the television broadcast of Sesame Street, which is aimed at preschoolers. Katy Perry fans will still be able to view the video on YouTube." [...] Perry mocked the controversy shortly afterwards in a skit during her appearance on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest, wearing an Elmo-themed shirt which showed large amounts of cleavage.|$|E
30|$|<b>Antonym</b> of {{the correct}} answer. More than 50 % of the high-proficiency test takers did not select {{three out of four}} {{distractors}} in this category. If the distractor and correct answer are <b>antonym</b> pair, this suggests that one of them is wrong. This kind of distractor is not distracting.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>antonyms</b> are al [...] "he" [...] and la [...] "she" [...] (compare li [...] "s/he"), the ge- (completive) and eg- (inchoative) aspects, fin- [...] "to finish" [...] and nif- [...] "to begin", and graf- [...] "to write" [...] and farg- [...] "to read".|$|E
2500|$|Both Avestan aša/arta and Vedic ŗtá- are {{commonly}} translated as [...] "truth" [...] as this best reflects both the original {{meaning of the}} term as well as the opposition to their respective <b>antonyms.</b> The opposite of Avestan aša/arta is druj-, [...] "lie." [...] Similarly, the opposites of Vedic [...] are [...] and druh, likewise [...] "lie".|$|E
2500|$|Two root <b>antonyms</b> are {{frequently}} encountered: eta (little), and dura (hard [...] ). However, their popularity {{is due to}} their iconicity. Eta {{is derived from the}} diminutive suffix and more properly means slight, but it's a little word, and its use for malgranda (little) is quite common. The reason for the popularity of dura is similar: official malmola simply sounds too soft to mean [...] "hard".|$|E

2500|$|Public health {{practitioners}} {{have attempted to}} look at substance use from a broader perspective than the individual, emphasizing the role of society, culture, and availability. Some health professionals choose to avoid the terms alcohol or drug [...] "abuse" [...] in favor of language they consider more objective, such as [...] "substance and alcohol type problems" [...] or [...] "harmful/problematic use" [...] of drugs. The Health Officers Council of British Columbia — in their 2005 policy discussion paper, A Public Health Approach to Drug Control in Canada] — has adopted a public health model of psychoactive substance use that challenges the simplistic black-and-white construction of the binary (or complementary) <b>antonyms</b> [...] "use" [...] vs. [...] "abuse". This model explicitly recognizes a spectrum of use, ranging from beneficial use to chronic dependence.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1994, {{substantial}} {{changes were made}} to the SAT. <b>Antonyms</b> were removed from the verbal section in order to make rote memorization of vocabulary less useful. Also, the fraction of verbal questions devoted to passage-based reading material was increased from about 30% to about 50%, and the passages were chosen to be more like typical college-level reading material, compared to previous SAT reading passages. The changes for increased emphasis on analytical reading were made in response to a 1990 report issued by a commission established by the College Board. The commission recommended that the SAT should, among other things, [...] "approximate more closely the skills used in college and high school work". A mandatory essay had been considered as well for the new version of the SAT; however, criticism from minority groups as well as a concomitant increase in the cost of the test necessary to grade the essay led the College Board to drop it from the planned changes.|$|E
50|$|Antonymy {{refers to}} {{words that are}} related by having the {{opposite}} meanings to each other.There are three types of antonyms: graded <b>antonyms,</b> complementary <b>antonyms</b> and relational <b>antonyms.</b>|$|E
50|$|An antonym {{is one of}} a pair {{of words}} with {{opposite}} meanings. Each word in the pair is the antithesis of the other. A word may have more than one antonym. There are three categories of <b>antonyms</b> identified {{by the nature of the}} relationship between the opposed meanings. Where the two words have definitions that lie on a continuous spectrum of meaning, they are gradable <b>antonyms.</b> Where the meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum and the words have no other lexical relationship, they are complementary <b>antonyms.</b> Where the two meanings are opposite only within the context of their relationship, they are relational <b>antonyms.</b>|$|E
