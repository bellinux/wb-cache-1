40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was firstly to {{describe}} the ecological and geographical differentiation of the four maple species (Acer spp.) in Serbia and Kosovo based on floristic and phytocoenological data, and secondly, to model their distributions in order to predict which areas the species can be expected in. The intention was also to compare the resulting prediction maps with the available field records and see whether there are any differences between the actual and the predicted ranges. The data set included 1979 species records and each record was accompanied by geographic coordinates. The geographical analysis was performed on the chorological data (latitude, longitude, altitude), while the ecological was based on vegetation data relating to the <b>association,</b> <b>alliance,</b> <b>order</b> and <b>class</b> as well as on 19 bioclimatic parameters. The data set was georeferenced using GIS tools. The results demonstrated that the distribution patterns of all the analyzed species are mostly affected by the limiting effects of the variables related to precipitation and temperature of the dry and also the warm period. Their synergic limiting effects are the most important force shaping distribution patterns within a territory. These findings highlight the importance of defining bioclimatic profiles of species using different techniques of distribution modelling...|$|R

40|$|This study {{intends to}} assess the {{application}} of Cocktail method in the classification of large vegetation databases. For this purpose, Buxus hyrcana dataset consisted of 442 relevés with 89 species were used and by the modified TWINSPAN. For running the Cocktail method, first primarily classification was done by modified TWINSPAN, and by performing phi analysis in the groups resulted five species were selected which had the highest fidelity value. Then sociological species groups were formed by examining co-occurrence of these 5 species with other species in the database. 21 plant communities belongs to 6 variant, 17 sub associations, 11 <b>associations,</b> 4 <b>alliance,</b> 1 <b>order</b> and 1 <b>class</b> were recognized by assigning 379 releves to the sociological species groups by using logical formulas.

According to 91 % classification agreement with Brown-Blanquet classification and Cocktail classification, we suggest Cocktail method to vegetation scientists as an efficient alternative of Braun-Blanquet method to classify large vegetation databases...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Vegetation {{classification}} {{consistent with}} the Braun-Blanquet approach is widely used in Europe for applied vegetation science, conservation planning and landmanagement. During {{the long history of}} syntaxonomy,many concepts and names of vegetation units have been proposed, but there has been no single classification system integrating these units. Here we (1) present a comprehensive, hierarchical, syntaxonomic system of <b>alliances,</b> <b>orders</b> and <b>classes</b> of Braun-Blanquet syntaxonomy for vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen, and algal communities of Europe; (2) briefly characterize in ecological and geographic terms accepted syntaxonomic concepts; (3) link available synonyms to these accepted concepts; and (4) provide a list of diagnostic species for all classes. Location: European mainland, Greenland, Arctic archipelagos (including Iceland, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya), Canary Islands,Madeira, Azores, Caucasus, Cyprus. Methods: We evaluated approximately 10 000 bibliographic sources to create a comprehensive list of previously proposed syntaxonomic units. These units were evaluated by experts for their floristic and ecological distinctness, clarity of geographic distribution and compliance with the nomenclature code. Accepted units were compiled into three systems of <b>classes,</b> <b>orders</b> and <b>alliances</b> (EuroVegChecklist, EVC) for communities dominated by vascular plants (EVC 1), bryophytes and lichens (EVC 2) and algae (EVC 3). Results: EVC 1 includes 109 <b>classes,</b> 300 <b>orders</b> and 1108 alliances; EVC 2 includes 27 <b>classes,</b> 53 <b>orders</b> and 137 <b>alliances,</b> and EVC 3 includes 13 <b>classes,</b> 24 <b>orders</b> and 53 <b>alliances.</b> In total 13 448 taxawere assigned as indicator species to classes of EVC 1, 2087 to classes of EVC 2 and 368 to classes of EVC 3. Accepted syntaxonomic concepts are summarized in a series of appendices, and detailed information on each is accessible through the software tool EuroVegBrowser. Conclusions: This paper features the first comprehensive and critical account of European syntaxa and synthesizes more than 100 yr of classification effort by European phytosociologists. It aims to document and stabilize the concepts and nomenclature of syntaxa for practical uses, such as calibration of habitat classification used by the European Union, standardization of terminology for environmental assessment, management and conservation of nature areas, landscape planning and education. The presented classification systems provide a baseline for future development and revision of European syntaxonomy...|$|R

5000|$|Adding to the {{variability}} of male alliances, some species such as bottlenose dolphins form at least two levels of male alliances.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} classify the variety of vegetation types at Mount Endut, Gunung Halimun-Salak National Park. Vegetation sampling was carried out with systematic sampling with random start. Vegetation type at alliance level was determined with vegetation ordination using factor analysis. Four vegetation alliances can be extracted from the ordination. These alliances are Castanopsis acuminatissima-Schima wallichii/Freycinetia javanica (alliance 1); Castanopsis argentea-Dendrocnide stimulans/Schismatoglottis calyptrata (alliance 2); Coffea canephora var. robusta-Quercus lineata/F. javanica(alliance 3) and Paraserianthes falcataria-Coffea canephora var. robusta/Oplismenus compositus (alliance 4). Vegetation alliances form due to their similarity in structure, composition, and physiognomy of vegetation. There are four vegetation <b>associations</b> at <b>alliance</b> 1, i. e. Castanopsis acuminatissima vegetation association, Schima wallichii vegetation association, Garcinia rostrata vegetation association, and Quercus lineata- Eurya acuminata /Freycinetia javanica vegetation <b>association.</b> <b>Alliance</b> 2 has four vegetation associations i. e. Dendrocnide stimulans vegetation association, Coffea canephora var. robusta vegetation association, Castanopsis argentea -Castanopsis acuminatissima vegetation association, and Schismatoglottis calyptrata-Etlingera coccinea vegetation association. There are seven vegetation <b>associations</b> belonging to <b>alliance</b> 3 i. e.
