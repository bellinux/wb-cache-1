Here we show using whole-cell patch clamp recordings that glucocorticoids elicit a rapid, opposing action on synaptic glutamate and �-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release onto magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, suppressing glutamate release and facilitating GABA release by activating a putative membrane receptor. The glucocorticoid effect on both glutamate and GABA release was blocked by inhibiting postsynaptic G protein activity, suggesting a dependence on postsynaptic G protein signaling and the involvement of a retrograde messenger.

40|$|While many {{realistic}} {{manual control}} tasks require human operators to control multiple degrees-of-freedomsimultaneously, {{our understanding of}} such multi-axis manual control has not moved far beyond considering it simply as the control of multiple fully-independent axes. This investigation aims to further our understanding of multi-axis control by focusing on one phenomenon that is known to occur in such tasks: crossfeed. Crossfeed occurs when operators’ inputs in one controlled <b>axis</b> <b>feed</b> into another controlled degree-of-freedom, thereby affecting overall control performance. A human-in-the-loop experiment, in which operators performed a dual-axis aircraft roll and pitch tracking task with physical motion feedback, was conducted in the SIMONA Research Simulator at TU Delft. Three conditions were tested: the full dual-axis control task, supplemented with reference single-axis roll and pitch tasks. Through the use of independent target and disturbance forcing function signals in both controlled axes, {{we were able to}} detect the presence of crossfeed in this dual-axis task from spectral analysis. Furthermore, these signals facilitated the objective identification of the dynamics of the crossfeed contribution, in parallel with estimating operators visual and motion responses. The crossfeed dynamics were found to resemble the well-known dynamics of human operators’ visual responses. The crossfeed contribution was found to explain up to 20 % of the measured control inputs, thereby indicating that crossfeed can be a factor of significance in multi-axis manual control.

40|$|AbstractThe {{processing}} speed of machine tools for ultra precision manufacturing are {{low compared to}} precision manufacturing to satisfy the precision requirements. To increase the productivity and develop machines for ultra precision high performance cutting (UP-HPC) {{it is essential to}} examine and compensate dynamic effects. In this work the positioning behavior of an ultra precision <b>feed</b> <b>axis</b> at different setpoint velocities is analyzed and compared to a high speed <b>feed</b> <b>axis.</b> It is observed that the ultra precision <b>feed</b> <b>axis</b> has a large overshoot of several micrometers if the velocities are increased. Further, the decay time of the ultra precision <b>feed</b> <b>axis</b> exceeds the decay time of the high speed <b>feed</b> <b>axis</b> by more than factor two.

40|$|Glucocorticoids {{secreted}} {{in response}} to stress activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal <b>axis</b> <b>feed</b> back onto the brain to rapidly suppress neuroendocrine activation, including oxytocin and vasopressin secretion. Here we show using whole-cell patch clamp recordings that glucocorticoids elicit a rapid, opposing action on synaptic glutamate and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) release onto magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, suppressing glutamate release and facilitating GABA release by activating a putative membrane receptor. The glucocorticoid effect on both glutamate and GABA release was blocked by inhibiting postsynaptic G protein activity, suggesting a dependence on postsynaptic G protein signaling and the involvement of a retrograde messenger. Biochemical analysis of hypothalamic slices treated with dexamethasone revealed a glucocorticoid-induced rapid increase in the levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG). The glucocorticoid suppression of glutamate release was blocked by the type I cannabinoid receptor cannabinoid receptor antagonist, AM 251, and was mimicked and occluded by AEA and 2 -AG, suggesting it was mediated by retrograde endocannabinoid release. The glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release was also blocked by AM 251 but was not mimicked by AEA, 2 -AG, or a synthetic cannabinoid, WIN 55, 2122, nor was it blocked by vanilloid or ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, suggesting that it was mediated by a retrograde messenger acting at an AM 251 -sensitive, noncannabinoid/nonvanilloid receptor at presynaptic GABA terminals. The combined, opposing actions of glucocorticoids mediate a rapid inhibition of the magnocellular neuroendocrine cells, which in turn should mediate rapid feedback inhibition of the secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin by glucocorticoids during stress activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis...|$|E
40|$|Lifetime {{performance}} variability is {{a powerful}} tool for evaluating herd management. Although efficiency is a key aspect of performance, it has not been integrated into existing studies on the variability of lifetime performance. The goal of the present article is to analyse the effects of various herd management options on the variability of lifetime performance by integrating criteria relative to feed efficiency. A herd model developed for dairy goat systems was used in three virtual experiments to test the effects of the diet energy level, the segmentation of the feeding plan and the mean production potential of the herd on the variability of lifetime performance. Principal component analysis showed that the variability of lifetime performance was structured around the first axis related to longevity and production and the second related to the variables used in feed efficiency calculation. The intra-management variability was expressed on the first axis (longevity and production), whereas the inter-management variability was expressed on the second <b>axis</b> (<b>feed</b> efficiency) and was mainly influenced by the combination of the diet energy level and the mean production potential. Similar feed efficiencies were attained with different management options. Still, such combinations relied on different biological bases and, {{at the level of the}} individual, contrasting results were observed in the relationship between the obtained pattern of performance (in response to diet energy) and the reference pattern of performance (defined by the production potential). Indeed, our results showed that over-feeding interacted with the feeding plan segmentation: a high level of feeding plan segmentation generated a low proportion of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential, whereas a single ration generated a larger proportion. At the herd level, the diet energy level and the herd production potential had marked effects on production and efficiency due to dilution of fixed production costs (i. e. maintenance requirements). Management options led to similar production and feed efficiencies at the herd level while giving large contrasts in the proportions of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential. These results suggested that analysing individual variability on the basis of criteria related to production processes could improve the assessment of herd management. The herd model opens promising perspectives in studying whether individual variability represents an advantage for herd performance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{machine tools}} for micro {{manufacturing}} feature unfavorable ratios of installation space to work space {{as well as}} moving masses compared to the work piece mass. Therefore, these machines show potential for optimization [1]. Machine tool components leading to these drawbacks are the currently used feed axes. The required features of such feed axes for micro manufacturing comprise high functional integration, high damping and high precision. Compared to electromechanically build up feed axes incorporating high installation space as well as small damping ratios due to linear guide rails, hydraulic feed axes feature the potential of a high force density and high damping ratios. However, a drawback is the poor precision. At the wbk Institute of Production Science Karlsruhe a novel approach has been realized: A highly integrated hydraulic <b>feed</b> <b>axis</b> with high compactness due to the hydraulic force density. Additionally, it features high functional integration by piezoelectric seat valves built into the piston rod and an integrated hydrostatic guidance system.

We also developed the allometric niche model, in which body size is used as the niche dimension.

40|$|Fertility {{relies on}} the proper {{functioning}} of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. The hormonal cascade begins with hypothalamic neurons secreting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the hypophyseal portal system. In turn, the GnRH-activated gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary release gonadotropins, which then act on the gonads to regulate gametogenesis and sex steroidogenesis. Finally, sex steroids close this <b>axis</b> by <b>feeding</b> back to the hypothalamus.

This secretory profile is critical for gonadotropic function, yet the mechanisms underlying these pulses remain unknown.

Space cryocoolers {{are often}} used to cool the focal planes and optics of {{telescope}}s.
