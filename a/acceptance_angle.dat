25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the <b>acceptance</b> <b>angle</b> of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E

At the end, the concentrator must still have enough acceptance to capture sunlight which also has some angular dispersion &theta;S when seen from earth.

To allow comparable performance predictions, precise and replicable measuring methods are needed. In this {{paper we propose a}} measurement method and set-up (VLABS: very-low-angle beam spread) to determine the specular reflectance for variable angular acceptance. Our measurement set-up and method VLABS is advanced in measurement accuracy and speed, it gives as a result the specular reflectance for variable <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> with an angular resolution of 0. 03 Â mrad.

40|$|Male Empress Leilia {{butterflies}} (Asterocampa leilia) use a sit-and-wait {{tactic to}} locate mates. To see how vision might influence male behavior, we studied the morphology, optics, and receptor physiology {{of their eyes}} and found the following. (1) Each eye's visual field is approximately hemispherical with at most a 10 degrees overlap {{in the fields of}} the eyes. There are no large sexual differences in visual field dimensions. (2) In both sexes, rhabdoms in the frontal and dorsal ommatidia are longer than those in other eye regions. (3) Interommatidial angles are smallest frontally and around the equator of the eye. Minimum interommatidial angles are 0. 9 - 1 degrees in males and 1. 3 - 1. 4 degrees in females. (4) <b>Acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> of ommatidia closely match interommatidial angles in the frontal region of the eye. We conclude that vision in these butterflies is mostly monocular and that males have more acute vision than females, especially in the frontal region (large facets, small interommatidial <b>angles,</b> small <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles,</b> long rhabdoms, and a close match between interommatidial <b>angles</b> and <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles).</b> This study also suggests that perched males direct their most acute vision where females are likely to appear but show no eye modifications that appear clearly related to a mate-locating tactic...|$|R

50|$|For {{very low}} concentrations, the wide {{acceptance}} angles of nonimaging optics avoid {{the need for}} active solar tracking. For medium and high concentrations, a wide <b>acceptance</b> <b>angle</b> {{can be seen as}} a measure of how tolerant the optic is to imperfections in the whole system. It is vital to start with a wide <b>acceptance</b> <b>angle</b> since it must be able to accommodate tracking errors, movements of the system due to wind, imperfectly manufactured optics, imperfectly assembled components, finite stiffness of the supporting structure or its deformation due to aging, among other factors. All of these reduce the initial <b>acceptance</b> <b>angle</b> and, after they are all factored in, the system must still be able to capture the finite angular aperture of sunlight.|$|E

40|$|Anopheles gambiae and Toxorhynchites brevipalpis {{represent}} the nocturnal and diurnal extremes of the mosquito light intensity range, {{and their eyes}} are structurally very different. A. gambiae has fused rhabdoms with huge <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles,</b> whereas T. brevipalpis has open rhabdoms with rhabdomere <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> comparable with those of advanced (brachyceran) flies. Here, we show that the retina-lamina projections are consistent with these differences. The short receptor axons from each ommatidium in A. gambiae insert as a group between four lamina monopolar cell clusters. In T. brevipalpis axon bundles from each ommatidium undergo a twist in their passage through the nuclear layer of the lamina, and then fan out into a space the diameter of which is about twice {{the separation of the}} monopolar cell clusters. This arrangement is consistent with a neural superposition mechanism closely similar to that found in higher Diptera, but which must have evolved independently...|$|R
40|$|Etiolated {{tissues of}} several plants are {{multiple}} bundles of fiber optics capable of coherent transfer of light over at least 20 mm. The <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> (the angles at which light can be intercepted and then internally reflected longitudinally) for mung beans, oats, and corn are 47 Â°, 59 Â°, and 52 Â°- 54 Â°, respectively. The {{shapes of the}} curves that describe the <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> are the same for various tissues of the same plant but differ between species. The pattern of light transmitted longitudinally through a tissue {{is dependent on the}} angle at which the light intercepts the side of the tissue and is strongly influenced by the tissue geometry.

40|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{collection}} at seven sites is calculated for air and vacuum flat plate collectors and a vacuum collector using cylindrical Winston concentration. The hourly intensity and angular distribution of solar radiation is predicted for the calcula-tions using insolation measurements and an insolation model. Tracking configurations include two-axis, vertical axis, polar axis and east-west axis tracking. Fixed collector arrays are all tilted towards the equator at the latitude angle. These calculations indicate energy collection varies linearly with cloudiness index KT. Diffuse radiation is a 15 % of energy collected by concentrating collector arrays at low operating temperatures where large <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> maximize energy collection. Smaller <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles,</b> required to maximize collection at higher operating temperatures, eliminate {{the advantage of}} Winston concentration for tracking arrays. Absorbers with high selectivity are neces-sary for high efficiency of fixed evacuated collectors at higher operating temperatures. Ratios of tracking to fixed collector energy collection increase rapidly between a 200 Â°C and a 300 Â°C making it likely that tracking becomes economically viable in this temperature range. These results are easily extended to other cylindrical concentrating collectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} and anatomical {{consequences of}} diurnal changes in screening pigment position were investigated in the apposition {{eye of the}} portunid crab Scylla serrata. Intracellular recordings revealed that the <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> of dark-adapted photoreceptors enlarged up to four-fold at night compared with photoreceptors dark-adapted in the day. Furthermore, while light adaptation at night caused <b>acceptance</b> <b>angles</b> to narrow, dark adaptation in the day caused no significant broadening of angles. These electrophysiological changes correlated with pigment movements in the eye observed both histologically and in the deep pseudopupil. It is found that the distal pigment cells change diurnally so that the field-stop which these cells form {{in front of the}} photoreceptors is opened in the night and closed in the day time. One feature of the diurnal rhythm is that it prevents photoreceptor fields of view enlarging when eyes are dark adapted in the day. In Scylla, photoreceptor fields of view take tens of minutes to narrow upon exposure of crabs to light at night. By preventing a similar broadening in the day, the diurnal rhythm may enable animals suddenly leaving dark refuges to be pre-adapted to daylight. To a range of species which utilise refuges such a mechanism would be of significant advantage, especially after disturbance by predators. ...|$|R
