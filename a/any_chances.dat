5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, {{had taken over the}} last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E

5|$|During {{the truce}} of 1206–1208, John focused on {{building}} up his financial and military resources {{in preparation for}} another attempt to recapture Normandy. John used some of this {{money to pay for}} new alliances on Philip's eastern frontiers, where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern France's neighbours. By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with his nephew Otto IV, a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, {{as well as with the}} counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders. The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou. Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his elder son, Louis, to invade Flanders with the intention of next launching an invasion of England. John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat. He launched his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme. The attack was a success, destroying Philip's vessels and <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> of an invasion of England that year. John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213, but baronial discontent again delayed his invasion plans until early 1214, in what was his final Continental campaign.|$|E

25|$|The war {{had great}} consequences. The Middle East had been {{dominated}} for centuries {{by the power}} of the Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire; {{by the end of the}} 13th century, neither of the two were in a position to project power; the Fatimids having been toppled by the Kurdish influenced Ayyubids, whilst the Byzantines severely weakened by the Seljuqs. Power shifted to the Mamelukes by the 14th century and then back to the Turks in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Never again would a Christian Kingdom wield so much military and political power in the Middle East. As the Turks steadily gained ground in Anatolia, the local population converted to Islam, further reducing <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> of a successful reconquest.|$|E

Chelsea drew 1–1 away to Liverpool and played out a 1-1 home draw against Leicester City, with Claudio Ranieri, former Chelsea boss, being received a guard of honour.

25|$|Task Review: Alpha {{decided to}} rent out the Aston Martin and the Pagani Zonda, the latter a risky move {{due to its}} rental price of £2,750 for one day. While the team {{struggled}} to find sales, with Lucinda faring the worst due to sales not being her natural area, things turned around after Lee made a few deals, followed by Lucinda making one sale after shadowing him, and Alex striking a couple of large deals on the Zonda, one made just before the task's deadline. Meanwhile, Renaissance decided to rent out the Ferrari and Spyker, but earned less sales; although Claire and Helene attracted customers to the Spyker, only the former made sales, while Michael had a fruitless search for customer for the Ferari, just missing out a sale from one. Their overall performance effectively ended <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> of winning the task.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Tibet in Exile {{disputes}} most {{demographic statistics}} {{released by the}} PRC government since they do not include members of the People's Liberation Army garrisoned in Tibet, or the floating population of unregistered migrants, and states that China is attempting to assimilate Tibet and further diminishing <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> of Tibetan political independence. CCP member Jampa Phuntsok, chairman of the TAR, {{has said that the}} central government has no policy of migration into Tibet due to its harsh high-altitude conditions, that the 6% Han in the TAR is a very fluid group mainly doing business or working, and that there is no immigration problem. (This report includes both permanent and temporary residences in Tibet, but excludes Tibetans studying or working outside of the TAR). By 2006, 3% of the permanent residences in Tibet were of Han ethnicity, according to National Bureau of Statistics of China. The TAR has the lowest population density among China's province-level administrative regions, mostly due to its mountainous and harsh geographical features. As of 2000, 92.8% of the population were ethnic Tibetans, while Han Chinese comprised 6.1% of the population. In Lhasa, the capital of TAR, Hans made up 17%, far less than what many activists have claimed. Population control policies like the one-child policy apply only to Han Chinese, not to minorities such as Tibetans.|$|E
25|$|Bengaluru began March with an away {{game against}} Mumbai. After {{persistent}} attack from both sides, Bengaluru scored first when Eugeneson Lyngdoh curled a {{shot into the}} far corner. Mumbai equalized quickly {{in the second half}} via Josimar. Bengaluru created chances late in the game, but man of the match, Mumbai goalkeeper Nidhin Lal, saved all the attempts and both teams eventually shared a point. After the mid-season break, Bengaluru played the away game against Salgaocar. The game also marked the return of top players of Bengaluru, who were away for the national duty. Bengaluru enjoyed a lion share of possession, but could not convert <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> {{in the first half and}} the game remained goalless. Robin Singh finally broke the deadlock with a pass from Rino Anto. Salgaocar had the chance to equalize when they were awarded penalty, but man of the match Lalthuammawia Ralte, correctly guessed the direction and saved the penalty to secure 3 points for Bengaluru. Bengaluru ended the March on a high note with a convincing 4–1 victory at home against Sporting Clube de Goa. Bengaluru took the lead in the first half when Josh Walker's header converted a pass from Eugeneson Lyngdoh in a goal. Rino Anto, Thoi Singh, and Beikhokhei Beingaichho scored a goal each in the second half. Sporting Goa's multiple attacks, especially from Odafe Onyeka Okolie, were thwarted by man of the match Lalthuammawia Ralte.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the season, he {{had surgery}} on his right ankle and foot to correct {{deformities}} because of an abnormal arch that caused him to stretch his ankle tendons. He was expected to have the same surgery done on his left foot and to be sidelined until January, but a doctor considered he did not need it and he was ready to play by the start of the 2006–07 NHL season. On 14 September 2006, Forsberg became the Flyers' 15th captain in team history, after Keith Primeau retired. The season was troubled for him: as the Flyers were having their worst season ever, Forsberg had not fully recovered from his right foot problems and had doubts about his future. With his contract ending at {{the end of the}} season and with no commitment on Forsberg's part to signing a new contract or to retire, on 15 February 12 days before the trade deadline, the Flyers traded him to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Ryan Parent, Scottie Upshall and Nashville's first- and third-round 2007 picks to boost Nashville's playoff run. At the Predators' last regular season game, Forsberg returned to Denver for the first time since leaving the Colorado Avalanche. He assisted on another former Avalanche player Paul Kariya's game-winning goal that eliminated <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> the Avalanche had of progressing to the playoffs, the first time ever the franchise had failed to do so since moving to Colorado. The Predators lost in the first round of the playoffs against the San Jose Sharks, with Forsberg scoring four points in the five game series. Forsberg had an average of less than one point per game in the regular season for the first time in his career and for the second time in the playoffs.|$|E
