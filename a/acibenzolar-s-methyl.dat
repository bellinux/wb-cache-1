40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> to induce {{resistance}} in pepper plants against Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria {{was investigated in}} both growth chamber and open field conditions. Growth chamber experiments showed that <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> (300 µM) treatment protects pepper plants systemically and locally against X. campestris pv. vesicatoria. Evidence for this was {{a reduction in the}} number and diameter of bacterial spots and bacterial growth in planta. Systemic protection was also exerted by the <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> acid derivative, CGA 210007, which may be produced by hydrolysis in the plant. The efficacy of <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> was also found in open field conditions, where both leaves and fruit were protected from the disease. The highest efficacy (about 67 %) was obtained by spraying the plants 6 – 7 times every 8 – 12 days with a mixture of <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> and copper hydroxide (2. 5 + 40 g hl− 1 active ingredient). Persistence and translocation data obtained from the growth chamber experiments revealed a persistence of <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> lasting five days after treatment with rapid translocation and negligible levels of acid derivative formation. Since the protection exerted by <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> against bacterial spot disease was observed when the inducer was completely degraded, it would appear to be due to SAR activation...|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of chitinase and its involvement in systemic acquired disease resistance was analyzed using <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> and salicylic acid (SA). Resistance against scab (pathogen: Cladosporium cucumerinum) and the {{accumulation of}} chitinase were rapidly induced in cu-cumber plants after treatment with <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl.</b> In contrast, SA protected the plants from C. cucume-rinum and {{the accumulation of}} chitinase was induced only on the treated leaves. The accumulation of chitinase in response to inoculation with the pathogen was induced more rapidly in cucumber plants previously treated with <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> than in plants pretreated with SA or water. Thus, it appears that a prospective signal(s), that induces systemic resistance, can be transferred from leaves treated with <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> to the untreated upper and lower leaves where systemic resistance is elicited. In contrast, exogenously applied SA {{is not likely to}} function as a mobile, systemic resistance-inducing signal, because SA only induces localized acquired resistance.

A field study to evaluate control treatments against bacterial apical necrosis was carried out during three seasons on mango trees cv. Tommy Atkins in Huelva (Spain). Experimental treatments included Bordeaux mixture, fosetyl-Al, <b>acibenzolar-s-methyl,</b> gibberelic acid, silicon gel, a mixture between <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> and Bordeaux mixture, and combined applications of fosetyl-Al with Bordeaux mixture or silicon gel.

Since 8  h {{was needed for}} zoospores of P. capsici to infect pepper leaves (Table  8), {{a total of about}} 12  h apparently was required for activation of resistance. In cucumber, resistance against Colletotrichum lagenarium was detected within 6  h after inoculation of the inducer Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Smith et al., 1991). Tobacco leaves required about 2  weeks to develop resistance against Peronospora hyoscyami f. sp. tabacina following stem inoculation with the same organism (Cohen and Kuc, 1981). Activation of resistance against tomato spotted wilt virus in tobacco was observed within 2  days after treatment with <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> (Mandal et al., 2008).|$|E

40|$|Avaliou-se a ação ativadora do <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> (aSm) na indução de resistência à murcha-bacteriana do tomateiro, causada por Ralstonia solanacearum. Plantas das cultivares Santa Clara, Diana e AF- 2573, receberam sete aplicações semanais do aSm (2, 5 g i. a. / 100 L água), via pulverização foliar ou rega, iniciando-se 14 dias após a semeadura. Com 32 dias de idade, as mudas foram transplantadas para solo infestado com R. solanacearum, onde receberam outras quatro aplicações semanais do ativador, enquanto no tratamento-controle aplicou-se apenas água. Através de avaliações diárias do número de folhas e plantas murchas calcularam-se os valores da área abaixo da curva de progresso da doença. Sintomas de murcha evoluíram mais vagarosamente nas três cultivares quando as plantas foram pulverizadas com o aSm. Esse efeito foi significativo até a quarta semana do transplantio para solo infestado com R. solanacearum. The {{potential}} of <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> (aSm) as a plant resistance activator was evaluated against tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum.

40|$|<b>Acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> (ASM) is a {{functional}} analogue of salicylic acid {{involved in the}} mechanism of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In our study we assessed the production, in Solanum lycopersicum L., of proteins involved in the defence mechanism induced by ASM treatment, compared with plants infected by Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), respectively. Protein extracts were analysed by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate - PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Protein bands were excised, digested with trypsin and successively analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Para o controle da doença, foram utilizados produtos à base de extratos vegetais, manano-oligossacarídeos fosforilados, fosfitos e acibenzolar-S-metil, além de fungicidas tradicionais. A intensidade do míldio em folhas e cachos, a produtividade, o número total de cachos por parcela, o peso médio do cacho e baga e as características analíticas do mosto foram avaliados nas safras de 2007 / 2008 e 2008 / 2009. Os fosfitos proporcionaram proteção contra o míldio da videira, com produtividade semelhante à do tratamento com fungicidas tradicionais. Os tratamentos baseados em manano-oligossacarídeos fosforilados, acibenzolar-S-metil e extratos vegetais não apresentaram controle eficiente do míldio.

The objective of this study was to evaluate citronella essential oil in the control of rust and brown eye spot and in the activation of coffee plants defense responses. Twelve-month-old plants were sprayed with citronella oil 1000 µL L- 1, <b>acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> 200 mg L- 1 and tebuconazole fungicide 200 mg L- 1. Plants were inoculated with Hemileia vastatrix and Cercospora coffeicola seven days later. The application was repeated after 30 days. Plants with five months were sprayed with the same treatments to assess the induced defense responses. Citronella oil controlled rust and brown eye spot with efficiencies of 47. 2 % and 29. 7 %, respectively, while tebuconazole presented control of 96. 5 % and 90. 5 %, respectively. <b>Acibenzolar-S-methyl</b> reduced brown eye spot by 55. 9 % and showed no significant control of rust.
