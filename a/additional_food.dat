5|$|In 1985, five tammar {{wallabies}} {{were introduced}} onto North Island, {{and the population}} established successfully. Possible reasons for this success include {{the absence of the}} wallabies' natural predator, the carpet python (Morelia spilota imbricata); the availability of <b>additional</b> <b>food</b> and water from the fishers' huts, which are occupied during the harshest time of the year; and the presence of the air strip, which apparently provides <b>additional</b> <b>food</b> for them. By the 2000s, there were over 450 tammar wallabies on the island. The wallabies overgrazed and ringbarked the native vegetation, particularly the area burnt in 1935, thus reducing vegetation cover and causing a serious decline in populations of some plant species. In 2003, island residents asked the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM; now the Department of Environment and Conservation) for help in managing the issue. CALM staff visited the island in April and May of that year and produced a report recommending an investigation into controlling population levels by the use of implanted contraceptives. Exploration of this option began in 2005, but in July 2007 the research was discontinued. Around 60 wallabies were removed to educational institutions for research purposes, and culling began. By February 2008, the wallaby population had been reduced to around 25 individuals.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator ensured that <b>additional</b> <b>food</b> was available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E

5|$|Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners {{arrived on}} February 22–23, 1862. Many of the 2,398 Confederates {{in the first}} group were sick, ill fed, and without {{sufficient}} clothing for the cold, northern winters. The citizens of Indianapolis rallied to provide humanitarian aid for the prisoners, which included <b>additional</b> <b>food,</b> clothing, and supplies. Local doctors aided the sick and local women provided nursing care. The Athenaeum, {{at the corner of}} East Michigan Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and another local building were converted into hospitals to treat the Confederate prisoners. For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Poultry is {{the second}} most widely eaten type of meat in the world, {{accounting}} for about 30% of total meat production worldwide compared to pork at 38%. Sixteen billion birds are raised annually for consumption, more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units. Global broiler meat production rose to 84.6 million tonnes in 2013. The largest producers were the United States (20%), China (16.6%), Brazil (15.1%) and the European Union (11.3%). There are two distinct models of production; the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which {{can be traced back to}} the farm of origin. This model faces the increasing costs of implementing <b>additional</b> <b>food</b> safety requirements, welfare issues and environmental regulations. In contrast, the United States model turns the product into a commodity.|$|E
5|$|In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds {{mainly on}} {{invertebrates}} collected from pasture, such as beetles (Selatosomus aeneus and Otiorhynchus morio {{have been recorded}} from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European Hackberry (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, perhaps {{as a source of}} carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where <b>additional</b> <b>food</b> is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E

The provisions were soon exhausted and <b>additional</b> <b>food</b> was requisitioned from the local Maya villagers; this too was soon consumed. Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food, finding little. With discontent growing among his men, Montejo took the drastic step of burning his ships; this strengthened the resolve of his troops, who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucatán. Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat of Cozumel. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and instructed them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab, where the Spanish party halted for two months.|$|E
5|$|Supplies {{had been}} brought in {{through the air and}} via the Mexican navy {{containing}} food, blankets, and medicine early on October2. However, additional bad weather initially prevented further supplies from coming in. Around that time, President Echeverria ordered emergency aid to be sent La Paz, Los Mochis, and Ciudad Obregon, as well as three coastal Sonoran ports. In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000homeless persons. Meanwhile, city officials appealed for <b>additional</b> <b>food,</b> medicine, and construction materials. Gerald Ford, who was then the U.S. president, agreed to provide aid for victims of Hurricane Liza; the first of which arrived late on October2, containing food and construction materials. The next day, power had been restored to hospitals, government centers, and gas stations. The government said that it was rushing in 100,000meals as well as 40,000temporary shelters the first of which started to arrive on October5. within a week after the storm, however, one survivor of the storm noted that plenty of food had arrived from many places.|$|E
5|$|Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 {{soldiers}} {{under his}} second-in-command, Alonso d'Avila, and posted 20 more at nearby Pole.

Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat, when the latter made a visit to the mainland. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. His expedition passed through the towns of Xamanha, Mochis and Belma, none of which survives today. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and ordered them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab that was described as having 5,000 houses, where the Spanish party halted for two months.|$|E

40|$|Practice and {{duration}} of breastfeeding were examined in relation to traditional practices and modern recommendations on infant care in Sri Lanka. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 60 Sri Lankan mothers whose youngest child was 0. 5 - 4 years. The results show that all mothers had breastfed their infants. Most respondents introduced <b>additional</b> <b>foods</b> at 4 months, as recommended by local public health services. The median age at cessation of breastfeeding was 2. 9 years, in line with public health advice. Doctors were reported to oppose breastfeeding during a subsequent pregnancy. Eighty-two percent of mothers practised habitual bed-sharing with their children. Nighttime breastfeeding frequency was 4. 8 times per night for infants aged 0. 5 - 1 year and declined gradually over the next 3 years. Maternal working status did not influence the overall duration of breastfeeding. Sri Lankan mothers and infants were confronted with several factors opposing their breastfeeding relationship, notably near full-time work and the early introduction of <b>additional</b> <b>foods.</b> Even though exclusive breastfeeding was ended prematurely, the majority of mothers and infants managed to sustain a prolonged breastfeeding relationship. Mother-child bed-sharing and associated nighttime breastfeeding is proposed as an important factor supporting continued breastfeeding...|$|R
