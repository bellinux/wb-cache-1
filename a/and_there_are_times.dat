2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{said the}} film [...] "is silly and {{the plot is}} preposterous, but it labors under no {{delusions}} otherwise. It {{wants to be a}} hard-panting melodrama, with spies and sex and love and death, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when a movie like this is exactly what you feel like indulging." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carson {{opposed the}} Vietnam War, and capital punishment, favored racial equality, and was against criminalizing extramarital sex and pornography. He avoided {{explicitly}} mentioning {{his views on}} The Tonight Show, saying he [...] "hates to be pinned down", as that would [...] "hurt me as an entertainer, which is what I am." [...] As he explained in 1970, [...] "In my living room I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when I would like to express a view on the air. I {{would love to have}} taken on Billy Graham. But I'm on TV five nights a week; I have nothing to gain by it and everything to lose." [...] He also seldom invited political figures onto the Tonight Show because he [...] "didn't want it to become a political forum" [...] and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well a {{man must}} {{take care of}} himself, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when it becomes {{absolutely}} necessary to rest. Say, if we had some of those silver images here it wouldn't be a very hard job to carry them, eh?" ...|$|E
50|$|Casey’s {{opposite}} number, Fermoy goalkeeper Liam Coleman, {{sent that}} over <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for O’Hagan from {{a free and}} Alan O’Connor from a tight angle to reduce the arrears by half-time, Kiskeam 2-4 to 0-8 in front.|$|R
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|R
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War II, the membership of OUN had risen to 20,000 active members <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many <b>times</b> that number of supporters.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I was not judicious; {{but we are}} only human, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when my dislike for that rascal almost masters me," [...] he said. [...] "I would give much to learn who it is that slinks into his camp at night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you sure," [...] she asked, fixing her {{brilliant}} eyes upon him, [...] "that {{he needs}} your sympathy? He {{is very much}} in love with me, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when I could almost persuade myself that I am in love with him. At any rate, he attracts me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay--buried is the word," [...] she replied, [...] "crushed {{down and}} buried when they budded fairest. I often think of it, Tyrrel; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when, Heaven help me! I {{can think of}} little else.--Look at me--you {{remember}} what I was--see what grief and solitude have made me." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{made two}} unsuccessful attempts {{on the summit}} in early June, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for one more before the heavy snowfall {{that came with the}} summer monsoon would make climbing too dangerous. This last chance fell to the expedition's most experienced climber, George Mallory. To the surprise of other expedition members, Mallory chose the 22-year-old inexperienced Irvine above the older, more seasoned climber, Noel Odell. Irvine's proficiency with the oxygen equipment was obviously a major factor in Mallory's decision, but <b>there</b> has <b>been</b> some debate ever since about the precise reasons for his choice.|$|R
2500|$|Dixie <b>is</b> still mentioned, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a <b>time</b> where a {{woman named}} Di Kirby {{claims to be the}} [...] "back from the dead" [...] Dixie. It is later {{revealed}} that she is rather Dixie's half-sister.|$|R
50|$|Between 1919 <b>and</b> 1936, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> each <b>time</b> one {{municipal}} deputy, whereafter <b>there</b> <b>were</b> always two.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he explained, [...] "I know {{beforehand}} {{that you}} are speaking the truth as you see it. I know beforehand that any scheme in which you are engaged is {{for the benefit of}} our fellow creatures and not for their harm. But alas! you make yourself the judge of these things, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when individual effort is the most dangerous thing in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was very}} naughty of Lucia, no doubt: {{but even a}} worm will turn; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when {{people who have not}} courage to hold their peace must say {{something}} or other; and do not always, in the hurry, get out what they ought, but only what they have time to think of. And she forgot what she had said the next minute, in Major Campbell's question-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Palliser did {{not appear}} enthusiastic. “There are,” he said, “always drawbacks, and when there are none one {{generally}} makes them. The place is over head and heels in debt, and setting anything straight, especially if it entailed retrenchment, was never a favorite occupation of mine. Besides, a good deal depends upon my pleasing Godfrey Palliser, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when it’s a trifle difficult {{to get on with}} him.” ...|$|E
25|$|Niantic was rediscovered {{once again}} in 1978 during {{excavation}} for the Mark Twain Plaza Complex next to the Transamerica Pyramid, now about six blocks from the waterfront. Excavations <b>were</b> hurried, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little <b>time</b> for preservation or study.|$|R
25|$|Scrope v Grosvenor (1389) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} heraldic law cases brought in England. The case resulted from the fact that two different families were using the same undifferenced coat of arms. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the composition of coats of arms was very simple. Most shields consisted of only one charge and two tinctures, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> when two families bore the same coat of arms in the same jurisdiction. In the fourteenth century, though, cases of two unrelated families bearing the same coat of arms became less tolerated. When this happened, the monarch was usually called on to make a decision.|$|R
2500|$|At {{one stage}} of his childhood, {{he lived in a}} hostel as his mother had nowhere to live. Johnson credits his mother with helping him develop a {{football}} career, saying, [...] "She had a tough time, bringing up three kids as a single parent with no help apart from the goodwill of close friends, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> when we had nowhere to stay. At one point we were homeless and staying in a hostel, but once mum got herself on her feet after a few hard years, and passed her driving test so she could take me to football every week, that gave us a fresh start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] was the answer; and Boone's voice vibrated. [...] "She who sleeps there {{gave up a}} life {{of luxury}} for me; and is a three-hundred-mile journey too much to make, or a summer night too long to watch beside her? I am drawn here, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when one wonders if it is {{possible}} for us to rise into partial communion with those who have passed into the darkness before us." ...|$|E
60|$|It's {{so lonely}} by spells, Margaret {{sometimes}} thought wistfully. All the joys my good fortune has brought me can't quite fill my heart. There's always one little empty, aching spot. Oh, if I had somebody of my very own {{to love and}} care for, a mother, a sister, even a cousin. But there's nobody. I haven't a relative in the world, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when I'd give almost anything to have one. Well, I must try {{to be satisfied with}} friendship, instead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, {{to speak}} more solemnly, matters grow very serious with us, Paula--at least with me: <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when this {{restraint}} is really unbearable. It {{is possible to}} put up with reserve when the reserved being is by one's side, for the eyes may reveal what the lips do not. But when she is absent, what was piquancy becomes harshness, tender railleries become cruel sarcasm, and tacit understandings misunderstandings. However that may be, you shall never be able to reproach me for touchiness. I still esteem you as a friend; I admire you and love you as a woman. This I shall always do, however unconfiding you prove.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Unguided retarded Gravity bomb: Thirteen bombs hit British ships without detonating as {{they were}} dropped from very low {{altitude}} <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> insufficient <b>time</b> {{in the air for}} them to arm themselves. The problem was solved by June with new fuses (Kappa) bought in Spain [...]|$|R

50|$|Having let it {{be known}} that his {{services}} were available for import and export assignments, he soon found himself involved in minor smuggling activities (tobacco and alcohol, but no drugs, although the series never explained how he made a profit smuggling in a country where cigarettes over the counter are already a minimal fraction of the usual price elsewhere and Casablanca is over 300 km from the nearest border by sea). However, this brought him to the attention of the local chief of police, Colonel Mahmoud (Gerald Flood). The pair developed a healthy respect for each other <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> when they would join forces against a common enemy. Colonel Mahmoud was assisted by Inspector Larbi played by Bruce Montague.|$|R
60|$|My friends, {{do not be}} {{too sure}} that I have not been preaching Christ to you, and Christ's Spirit to you, and Christ's {{redemption}} too, most truly in this sermon, although I have mentioned none of them by name. There are times for ornamenting the house, there are times for repairing the wall, there are times, too, for thoroughly examining the foundation, because, if that be not sound, it is little matter what fine work is built up upon it; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when, as David says, {{the foundations of the}} earth are out of course, when men have forgotten sadly the very first principles of society and religion.|$|E
60|$|Kate and I screamed simultaneously. We tore {{across the}} kitchen, flung open the door, plunged down over Aunt Susanna's yard, {{scrambled}} {{over the fence}} and flew to the well. Just as we reached it, Tony's red head appeared as he climbed serenely out over the box. I don't know whether I felt more relieved or furious. He had merely fallen on the blank guard inside the box: <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when I am tempted to think he fell on purpose because he saw Kate and me {{looking out at the}} window. At least he didn't seem at all frightened, and grinned most impishly at us.|$|E
6000|$|Dodd, I remember, protested {{he had a}} self-consciousness {{that held}} all these {{constituents}} together, {{but there was a}} time when Dodd was six months old, let us say, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> now when Dodd sleeps or is lost in some vivid sensation or action, when that clear sense of self is in abeyance. There is no reason why the collective mind of the world should not presently become at least as self-conscious as Dodd. Boon, indeed, argued that that was happening even now, that our very talk in the greenhouse was to that synthetic over-brain like a child's first intimations of the idea of [...] "me." [...] "It's a fantastic notion," [...] said Dodd, shaking his head.|$|E
50|$|A pool is also {{located within}} Chastain Park. It {{is a city}} pool, meaning it {{is open to the}} public most of the time, but nonmembers must pay to get in, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some <b>times</b> when only members can swim. The Chastain Park Athletic Club swim-team {{practices}} at this pool.|$|R
50|$|At 80-85% HRmax, this {{intensity}} is primarily aimed towards runners {{training for the}} marathon. The pace is one at which the runner hopes to compete. The pace can be included in other programs for a more intense workout, especially if the runner feels fresh <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> enough <b>time</b> to recover afterwards.|$|R

6000|$|Her good-natured husband {{laughed at}} this little picture of himself. [...] "Ah, my darling, {{how many more}} times am I {{to make the same}} {{confession}} to my pretty priest? Try to remember, without more telling, that it's one of my misfortunes to be a man of many tempers. There are times when I get tired to death of Mr. Vimpany; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when the cheery old devil exercises fascinations over me. I declare you're spoiling the eyebrows that I admire by letting them twist themselves into a frown! After the trouble I have taken to clear your mind of prejudice against an unfortunate man, it's disheartening to find you so hard on the poor fellow's faults and so blind to his virtues." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{all these}} {{specialties}} {{have their own}} charm in their own way: <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when the particular humour of each man is refreshing to us from its very distinctness; but the effort to add any other qualities to this refreshing one instantly takes away the distinctiveness, and therefore the exact character to be enjoyed in its appeal to a particular humour in us. Our enjoyment arose from a weakness meeting a weakness, from a partiality in the painter fitting to a partiality in us, and giving us sugar when we wanted sugar, and myrrh when we wanted myrrh; but sugar and myrrh are not meat: and when we want meat and bread, we must go to better men.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} been in London at all," [...] she continued. [...] "I really only know what men and women are like from books, or the one or two types I have met around here. Now, {{do you think that that}} is enough to satisfy one? Of course it is very {{beautiful}} here, I know, and sometimes when the sun is shining and the birds singing and the sea comes up into the creeks, well, one almost feels content. But the sun doesn't always shine, Richard, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when I am right down bored, and I feel as though I'd love to draw my allowance from uncle, pack my trunk, and go up to London, on my own!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The tomb is 4.98 × 5.88 {{meters in}} dimension, which {{is smaller than}} many non-royal tombs of the period. [...] The reason for the tomb's small size {{according}} to Chinese archaeologists is that the emperor died suddenly when he escaped to Yangzhou during a coup, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no <b>time</b> to build a grand tomb.|$|R

50|$|After the Second World War, Mercedes-Benz {{was anxious}} to return to racing as soon as possible, but a new formula was {{announced}} for 1954, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> insufficient <b>time</b> to produce a new model.
