Although the volume of air freight accounts for only 1. 5 percent of the exports measured in tons, the value of air freight exports amounts to 25 percent of Germany’s external trade. In particular, <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> forms an important part of logistic concepts and supply chains of commercial and industrial enterprises for the shipment of high-value and time-sensitive goods.

The main research objective is to gain advanced insights and a profound understanding of the demand generating determinants and structures of air freight on a regional scale and its distribution patterns in the transportation system. In particular, the paper aims to investigate the generation of the disaggregated industry-specific air freight demand in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level. Building on these findings, the distribution of the regionally generated air freight is explored by modelling the airport choice behaviour of the air freight forwarders using a discrete choice approach. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>transport</b> {{provides}} a suitable way of transport for special types of freight such as emergency freight (spare parts, documents), high-value freight (gold, currency, and artwork) and perishables (pharmaceuticals, fresh food, cut flowers) as these products have very short shelf life {{and benefit from}} fast transit times. <b>Air</b> <b>transport</b> is also {{responsible for most of}} the value added. As stated by Boeing, even though air freight accounts for fewer than 2 per cent of total tonnage transported, it represents almost 40 per cent of aggregate value of total world trade, proving that it is a link of paramount importance for the global supply chains. Descriptive models can aid decision makers in their understanding of the response of global air freight flows to external factors such as the global economy and technological innovation and provide a quantitative underpinning of forecasts and of business cases for investment. Although in the <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> <b>transport</b> business, use is often made of long term forecasts, there is little shared knowledge about which methods should be preferred, and hardly any literature at the scientific level. Transport models were originally developed for passengers and ensuingly applied in freight. Although it is accepted that the four-step transport modelling methodology is a fitting framework for freight, many fundamental differences exist between them such as diversity in decision makers, commodities transported, mode properties, the networks etc. In the particular case of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> <b>transport,</b> these elementary dissimilarities call for an adaptation of the existing methods, towards a modelling framework better suited for the airborne movement of goods. There lacks a strategic model for air freight flows at the global scale that overcomes the insufficiencies of passenger oriented models. This research contributes to the literature by formulating a model for global air freight demand and network flows. The results of the model are presented in the form of international air freight flows, followed by results on a regional level, sensitivity analysis and validation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} conceptual model of freight modal choice {{in which the}} basic unit of analysis is the socio-organisational group. Research into freight modal choice {{at the level of}} the firm has tended to disregard the nature of human choice and to assume that modal choice can be explained in terms of technological phenomena or cost relationships. There is also a tendency to equate the modal choice of organisational members with the modal use of firms. The approach adopted in this work is to accept that there are different interest groups within shipper firms and that such groups may not necessarily form a consensus of opinion about freight model choice. It is assumed that different socia-organisational groups may form different implicit theories about transport systems. Such an approach is called the social perceptual approach.

Food and air miles are simplistic concepts and not indicators of sustainability or environmental impact.
