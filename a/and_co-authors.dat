5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> {{have been}} publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. B.oligantha resolves as sister taxon (that is, next closest relative) to B.ilicifolia, and B.cuneata resolves as sister to these two. This suggests a monophyletic B. subg. Isostylis; yet the clade appears fairly derived (that it, it evolved relatively recently), implying that B.subgenus Isostylis may not merit subgeneric rank.|$|E

Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia attenuata resolves as a basal member of and next closest relative, or 'sister', to a clade containing B.elegans and, within that, a monophyletic B.subg. Isostylis. An Eocene fossil cone named Banksia archaeocarpa, around 50 million years old, resembles that of B.attenuata.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> {{have been}} publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia aquilonia formed a clade with B.plagiocarpa, B.oblongifolia and B.robur, rather than B.integrifolia. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B.subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.aquilonia {{is placed in}} B.subg.

5|$|The genus Compsognathus gives {{its name}} to the family Compsognathidae, a group {{composed}} mostly of small dinosaurs from the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods of China, Europe and South America. For many years it was the only member known; however in recent decades paleontologists have discovered several related genera. The clade includes Aristosuchus, Huaxiagnathus, Mirischia, Sinosauropteryx, and perhaps Juravenator and Scipionyx. At one time, Mononykus was proposed {{as a member of the}} family, but this was rejected by Chen and coauthors in a 1998 paper; they considered the similarities between Mononykus and the compsognathids to be an example of convergent evolution. The position of Compsognathus and its relatives within the coelurosaur group is uncertain. Some, such as theropod expert Thomas Holtz Jr. <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> Ralph Molnar and Phil Currie in the landmark 2004 text Dinosauria, hold the family as the most basal of the coelurosaurs, while others as part of the Maniraptora.|$|E

Charles L. Grant and Kirby McCauley won the award as editors of anthologies while those were eligible; Grant was nominated nine times as an editor and once for a collection, while McCauley won both times he was nominated for anthologies.

25|$|After the {{publication}} of MELTS, Ghiorso continued to improve and extend it {{with the help of}} colleagues such as Mark Hirschmann, Paul Asimow, Pete Reiners and Victor Kress. After they identified some fundamental problems with the theory at high pressure, they developed pMELTS, a model for high pressures (1-3 gigapascals (GPa)), and published it in 1995. Asimow <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> published phMELTS, a model for mid-ocean ridge basalts that incorporated the effect of water content. In 1998, Ghiorso, Hirschmann and Tim Grove established the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR), an online database for experimental results on solid-melt equilibria. With Gil Gualda, he modified MELTS to work better with rhyolite, a silicate-rich series of rocks, and released rhyolite-MELTS.|$|E

25|$|Armid Mulkidjanian <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> {{think that}} the marine environments did not provide the ionic balance and {{composition}} universally found in cells, {{as well as of}} ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to K+/Na+ ratio, Mn2+, Zn2+ and phosphate concentrations. The only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on Earth are found in terrestrial hydrothermal pools fed by steam vents. Additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable pH (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful UV radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, and a continual supply of abiotically generated organic molecules, both by chemical reactions in the hydrothermal environment, as well as by exposure to UV light during transport from vents to adjacent pools. Their hypothesized pre-biotic environments are similar to the deep-oceanic vent environments most commonly hypothesized, but add additional components that help explain peculiarities found in reconstructions of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all living organisms.|$|E

500|$|According to Turner <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> Norell and Peter Makovicky, quill knobs are {{not found}} in all prehistoric birds, and their absence {{does not mean that}} an animal was not {{feathered}} – flamingos, for example, have no quill knobs. However, their presence confirms that Velociraptor bore modern-style wing feathers, with a rachis and vane formed by barbs. The forearm specimen on which the quill knobs were found (specimen number IGM 100/981) represents an animal [...] in length and [...] in weight. Based on the spacing of the six preserved knobs in this specimen, the authors suggested that Velociraptor bore 14 secondaries (wing feathers stemming from the forearm), compared with 12 or more in Archaeopteryx, 18 in Microraptor, and 10 in Rahonavis. This type of variation in the number of wing feathers between closely related species, the authors asserted, is to be expected, given similar variation among modern birds.|$|E
