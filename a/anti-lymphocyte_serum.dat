5|$|Woodruff's {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised {{a method of}} implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that {{remains one of the}} world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's {{contributions to}} the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.|$|E
40|$|Lymphocytes from kidney-grafted {{patients}} treated with anti-lymphocytic-globulin {{were found to}} be stimulated normally by phytohaemagglutinin to increased DNA synthesis, but to have lost their responsiveness to <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum.</b> Lymphocytes from kidney-grafted patients, who were not treated with anti-lymphocytic globulin, and uraemic patients prior to transplantation, responded more or less normally to both phytohaemagglutinin and <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum.</b> It is suggested that these findings cannot be explained by a shift in the cell populations as a consequence of anti-lymphocytic-globulin treatment, but rather by modulation of lymphocyte responsiveness to various triggering mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Nephrotoxic serum nephritis as a {{potential}} effect of the administration of heterologous <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> was investigated in dogs. Horse anti-dog lymphocyte serum, prepared using lymph node cells, was demonstrated by immunofluorescent techniques to possess both in-vitro and in-vivo anti-glomerular antibody activity. Experiments were designed to eliminate {{as far as possible}} conditions which would allow a serum sickness type of nephritis to develop, while permitting expression of the putative anti-glomerular antibody activity. While none of the animals receiving <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> either subcutaneously or intravenously showed clinical evidence of glomerular injury, in some cases early histological changes were apparent and the reasons for their non-progressive nature are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We report {{here the}} {{expression}} of beta 2 -GPI mRNA by cell types involved in the pathophysiology of the anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), i. e. endothelial cells as a target of autoantibodies in the APS, astrocytes and neurones involved in APS of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Lymphocytes were also included in the study, as it has been demonstrated that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus-associated CNS diseases have <b>serum</b> <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> antibodies cross-reacting with brain antigens, and intrathecally synthesized anti-neurone antibodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme digestion of the product obtained demonstrated the presence of beta 2 -GPI mRNA in all cell types here tested, cultured both in presence and absence of fetal calf serum. In both culture conditions, the same cell types were immunoreactive to an anti-beta 2 -GPI MoAb, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence technique. Taken together, these results indicate a direct cell synthesis of beta 2 -GPI, suggesting an antigenic function of beta 2 -GPI in the APS, including the CNS disease that occurs in this syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} four anti-proliferative agents: azathioprine, chlorambucil, {{cyclophosphamide}} and methotrexate {{have been studied}} in the rat and compared with the actions of phenylbutazone, hydrocortisone and <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum.</b> All the anti-proliferative drugs effectively inhibited adjuvant arthritis. Therapeutic/toxic ratios were most favourable with cyclophosphamide, least favourable with azathioprine. In somewhat higher doses than those needed to inhibit adjuvant arthritis, the anti-proliferative drugs suppressed both the primary antibody response to sheep erythrocytes and the tuberculin skin test, and reduced the inflammatory paw swelling 48 hr after an injection of Freund's complete adjuvant. <b>Anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> produced effects {{very similar to the}} anti-proliferative agents, including the anti-inflammatory effect. The results suggest that the inhibition of delayed hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin in rats receiving cyclophosphamide may represent a predominantly anti-inflammatory, rather an immunosuppressive, effect...|$|E
40|$|Interaction {{of normal}} and Salmonella typhi `H'-sensitized rat lymph node cells with two {{different}} types of <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS) has been studied.

40|$|Heterologous <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to be the most potent immunosuppressive agent yet described (1). It has been shown that this antiserum not only prolongs the survival of skin or renal allografts in mice (2), rats (3), and dogs (4), but that it is able to suppress an allograft rejection already in progress (5). Furthermore, this remarkable immunosuppressive effect can be achieved without causing apparent toxicity in the recipients (1). These features have stimulated the use of heterologous antilymphocyte serum in human clinical trials (6). Previous reports have been limited to studying the action of heterologons <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> upon the lymphoid system. Little investigative work has been done on the effect of the antiserum on the closely related hemopoietic system. This is quite surprising in view of the demonstrated side effects accompanying prolonged antiserum treatment. Monaco and his associates (2) reported the occurrence of a severe wasting disease leading to death in mice receiving chronic injections with rabbit anti-mouse lymphocyte serum. Iwasak...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{administering}} <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS) to the F 1 hybrid recipient at various time intervals {{before and after}} the injection of parental donor cells has been investigated.

40|$|Preincubation with rabbit {{anti-human}} lymphocyte serum {{suppressed the}} in vitro cytotoxicity of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients suffering from Mikulicz's recurrent oral aphthae for oral epithelial cells. Further studies revealed {{that although the}} anti-lymphocyte antibody remained bound to the lymphocytes after the pre-incubation procedure it exerted no demonstrable cytotoxic effect and induced a minimal degree of transformation. The mechanisms by which the <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> may have suppressed the lymphocytotoxicity are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Horse anti-dog {{lymphocyte}} serum {{was found}} to suppress the immune response of dogs normally resulting from the injection of Salmonella typhi vaccine. Normal antibody levels of the dogs against Shigella dysenteriae were unaffected, however, by the <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum.</b> The results suggest, therefore, that the natural antibodies may arise by a population of cells or by mechanisms different from those which produce antibodies {{as a result of}} deliberate antigenic stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{designed}} to {{gain insight into}} the mechanism of action of the active component of antilymphocyte serum were carried out using an antibody eluate prepared from the IgG fraction of <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> by absorption and subsequent elution from thymocyte membrane. The resulting antibody eluate was labeled with radionuclide tracer to determine {{the fate of the}} antibody in vivo. The result indicated that anti-lymphocytic antibodies are eliminated from recipients extremely rapidly. The mechanism for this rapid clearance appears to depend upon the absorption of antibody molecules onto lymphocyte surfaces and the subsequent clearing and degradation of the antibody-lymphocyte complexes by the reticuloendothelial system. Distribution studies confirm that the major site of antibody-lymphocyte interaction occurs in the periphery with relatively little penetration of antibody within lymphoid organs. Radioautographic studies showed that the pattern of localization within lymphoid and other organs is confined to rather specific areas. These observations are believed to offer strong support for the notion that <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> achieves its immunosuppressive effect by bringing about a selective ablation of the population of recirculating lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|After {{incubation}} with thymosin, a thymic hormone, normal {{bone marrow}} rosette-forming cells acquire T-cell characteristics, including increased sensitivity to azathioprine, <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum,</b> and anti-theta serum. This activity of thymosin provides a new sensitive and reproducible bioassay for thymosin, and is well correlated with an in vivo graft-versus-host assay. In addition, incubation of spleen cells from adult thymectomized mice with thymosin in vitro restores to normal their diminished sensitivity to azathioprine and anti-lymphocte serum...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{requirements for}} the induction of antigen-specific suppressor cells (SC) in vitro were studied. Macrophage depletion, by either nylon wool or polystyrene columns or iron (and magnet) treatment {{or a combination of}} methods, did not diminish SC induction, in contrast to its effect on helper cell induction. The requirement for T-T interaction in SC induction using splenic T cells was studied by the use of adult thymectomy and <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum,</b> which selectively deplete short-lived and recirculating T cells respectively. Since suppressor cell induction was markedly diminished, or abolished by either procedure, but reconstituted by mixing these 2 populations, it was concluded that there was T-T interaction in the development of SC, just as there is in the induction of other T cell reactions, such as the graft-versus-host response, the T killer cell response, the helper cell response and, tentatively, delayed hypersensitivity. By the use of double-chamber tissue culture flasks, with the 2 cell populations separated by a cell impermeable membrane, it was found that T-T interaction does not require cell contact and is thus mediated by factor(s). The direct precursor of antigen-specific suppressor cells is resistant to adult thymectomy but sensitive to <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum...</b>|$|E
40|$|Immunosuppressive {{drugs are}} agents capable of suppressing the {{development}} {{of at least one}} type of immune response in vivo at doses with minimal side-effects. After an introduction in which different types of immune responses are briefly discussed, some characteristics regarding the mechanism of action of prednisolone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS) will be reviewed. Corticosteroids display mainly an anti-inflammatory effect. The immunosuppressive effect of azathioprine is questionable, cyclophosphamide influences the immune system itself and ALS suppresses fairly specific cellular immunit...|$|E

In comparison with <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> it was somewhat more effective in suppressing the secondary than the primary lesion of adjuvant-induced disease. The anti-inflammatory action of procarbazine could not be correlated exactly with its immunosuppressant effect.

40|$|Potent {{antisera}} against thymus lymphocytes {{have been}} shown by light and electron microscopy, to cause an increase in close cytoplasmic contacts between macrophages in monolayer tissue culture with subsequent aggregation (macrophage interlinkage reaction). This anti-macrophage activity remains present at high dilutions of antiserum, but can be markedly reduced by prior absorption with thymus lymphocytes. Evidence is presented which indicates that anti-lymphocyte antibody may also have anti-macrophage specificity and {{it is suggested that}} part of the immunosuppressive activity of <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> may be a consequence of this additional specificity...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{melanoma}} {{has been}} transplanted to allogeneic neonatal recipients receiving continuous immunosuppression with <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum.</b> One spontaneous melanoma was directly transplanted into 8 recipients, 6 of which developed tumours. 5 / 5 melanoma cell cultures were transplantable, with 19 tumour takes in 31 allogeneic recipients. Serial passage {{was performed in}} the case of two melanomas. Tumour development required continuous immunosuppression and the site was dependent upon the route of inoculation and other factors.

Labelled cells treated in vitro with ALS {{were unable to}} migrate to lymph nodes or spleens of recipients, as did normal cells, but instead distributed themselves very similarly to cells which {{had been killed by}} exposure to heat.

To date, no stud-ies have reported a stimulation of human -cell neoge-nesis in vivo. Therefore, we investigated whether human -, -, and duct cell growth can be stimulated when human islets are xenotransplanted to obese hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic ob/ob mice immuno-suppressed with <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum.</b> Moreover, we wanted to study whether -cell growth and duct-to–-cell differentiation were induced in the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) -dependent compensatory kidney growth model.

40|$|Intradermal {{inoculation}} of the guinea-pig with Leishmania enriettii {{results in}} a self-healing cutaneous lesion which provides a laboratory model of human cutaneous leishmaniasis and which is dominated by cell-mediated immunological responses (Bryceson et al., 1970). In this study we sought to design experimental situations resembling non-healing forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis in man and to determine whether these experimental situations were accompanied by abnormalities in the immunological response to infection. This paper describes three procedures which impair the resistance of guinea-pigs to leishmanial infection: (i) induction of partial immunological tolerance to leishmanial antigen; (ii) systemic injection of <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS); and (iii) regional antigenic competition produced by multiple injections of bacterial adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|Anti-guinea-pig and anti-mouse {{macrophage}} sera {{were prepared}} by immunizing rabbits with peritoneal cells {{which had been}} purified by short culture. Such sera caused agglutination and lysis of macrophages in vitro, as well as 51 Cr release, which showed some specificity for macrophages when compared with lymph node lymphocytes. Intravenous administration of anti-macrophage serum to guinea-pigs caused impairment of carbon clearance. Mice given anti-macrophage serum and immunized with sheep erythrocytes showed a normal plaque formation response.

40|$|Local {{inflammatory}} reaction at {{the site}} of injection of anti-human antilymphocyte serum is a troublesome side effect. In this paper, a simple experimental model is presented for studying the local reaction caused by antilymphocyte serum. Anti-mouse antilymphocyte sera were injected intracutaneously and the intensity of the consequent oedema was estimated by the extravasation of Evans Blue dye solution given intravenously. It was found: (a) that rabbit anti-mouse anti-spleen sera produce consistently stronger local reactions than either anti-lymph node or anti-thymus sera; (b) that there is as yet no correlation between the intensity of the local reaction and the immunosuppressive (graft-protective) activity of the <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> pools tested.

40|$|Lymphocytes from humans {{that had}} {{rejected}} allogeneic skin grafts acquired a cytotoxic potential, which was expressed in vitro upon contact with fibroblast monolayer {{cultures of the}} skin donor genotype. No cytotoxic effect was obtained on autochthonous fibroblasts, but did occur on other allogeneic fibroblasts, non-related to the skin donor, suggesting shared histocompatibility antigens. The damage to the target cells developed at the area of lymphocyte application and was detected after 48 hr. The cytotoxic effect of the immune lymphocytes on the specific target cells was suppressed by treatment with actinomycin-C, Mitomycin-C and prednisolone, indicating that cellular synthetic processes and cell divisions are required for cytotoxicity to be expressed. <b>Anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> also inhibited the cytotoxic reaction, probably by coating the lymphocyte surface...|$|E
40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of protease and trypsin reduced the electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of thymocytes; with higher concentrations it was normal or above. Differences in membrane structure of thymocytes, T and B cells was found as B cells showed no reduction while T cells gave intermediate values. Further the reduction was greater with protease than with trypsin. Formalin fixation increased the EPM of all normal cell types {{to a similar}} degree. The EPM of proteolytically treated thymocytes and B cells was increased to a similar level and {{to a greater degree}} than neuraminidase-treated thymocytes. Small amounts of sialic acid were detected in the supernatant after proteolytic treatment of thymocytes.

40|$|After 6. 5 years, the SEOPF {{prospective}} study of 3811 cadaver grafts is summarized. The prime variables of transfusions, homologous leucocytic antibodies (HLA) -A and B typing and <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> treatment, continue to beneficially affect survival, but {{trends in the}} data suggest that they either have small or short-term effects. Apparently the determinants of true long-term survival are still not uncovered. Any erythrocyte preparation provides the transfusion effect if administered more than 10 days and less than 365 days before transplantation. Dialysis {{in the first week}} after transplantation adversely affects graft survival. Splenectomy may improve graft survival, but increases patient mortality. Thus, we believe it is unwarranted as a routine measure.

A similar blocking is not observed when cells {{are treated with}} an <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum,</b> thereby excluding the possibility that any antibodies combining with surface structures could cause this effect. By the use of antisera specific for heavy or light chain antigens, {{it was possible to}} locate such antigens in the antigen-binding receptor areas of immune cells.

40|$|Two IgG subfractions {{of horse}} antilymphocyte serum (ALS) were {{obtained}} by DEAE Sephadex chromatography. Although the fractions did not differ antigenically, they differed on amino acid and carbohydrate analysis, and in electrophoretic mobility. As demonstrated by binding studies, only the most positively charged population of IgG molecules (fraction 1) obtained from <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> had specificity for the small lymphocyte; 50 per cent of the molecules in this population bound specifically to lymphocytes in vitro. As determined by an in vitro correlate of immunosuppressive potency (rosette inhibition), fraction 1 (F 1) IgG from ALS contained approximately 4 times the specific activity of fraction 2 (F 2). F 1 was significantly more effective in prolonging skin graft survival than F 2, whereas F 2 contained the major component of the non-specific anti-inflammatory activity of serum.

40|$|Heterologous <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS) and plasma (ALP) are potent {{immuno-suppressive}} agents. The findings {{recorded in}} this thesis relate to their use and mode of action in thymectomized, sham-thymectomized and non-thymectomized rats and mice. No method is at present available for the in vitro standardization of ALP in terms of immuno-suppressive potency. Potency cannot be related to either, agglutinating and cytotoxic antibody titres directed against lymphocytes or {{to the ability of}} ALP to depress lymphocyte counts. The latter property of ALP {{has been found to be}} largely dependent on normal adrenal function in the recipient. The ability of ALS to prolong allograft survival times can be significantly improved if the recipient is thymectomized prior to the administration of serum and grafting performed after the completion of the course of ALS.

40|$|Various {{factors that}} {{influence}} the skin allograft reaction were studied in mice, {{with the aid of}} <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS). H- 2 incompatible allografts were rejected more rapidly in female than in male hosts treated with ALS. Male mouse submandibular glands contained a substance that was immunosuppressive for both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. This substance, although only present in males, was not responsible for the sex difference in skin allograft survival. The sex difference was due instead to an immunopotentiating effect exerted by the ovaries of the female. ALS treatment was used in a weak histocompatibility system (H- 1) to investigate the origin and possible role of a nonsensitized cell population in the allograft reaction. Bone marrow but not thymus or spleen cells were demonstrated to act as effector cells in allograft rejection. The experimental results are discussed in relation to a proposal that this effector cell is a monocyte-macrophage...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a heterologous <b>anti-lymphocyte</b> <b>serum</b> (ALS) capable of specifically suppressing the delayed hypersensitivity (DH) response is reported.

The effect of ALS(CMI) on the primary DH response to SRBC using the footpad swelling test was studied. Its effect on the primary humoral immune response to SRBC was also studied using the Jerne plaque assay technique. ALS(CMI) suppressed the humoral antibody response to SRBC and the DH response to a third party antigen only when administered before the antigen, having no effect when administered post-antigenically.
