5|$|Mild {{impairment}} {{of attention and}} concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication.

5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
50|$|Agraphia can be broadly {{divided into}} central and {{peripheral}} categories. Central agraphias typically involve language <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> causing difficulty spelling or with spontaneous communication, {{and are often}} accompanied by other language disorders. Peripheral agraphias usually target motor and visuospatial skills in addition to language and tend to involve motoric <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> causing difficulty in the movements associated with writing. Central agraphia may also be called aphasic agraphia as it involves <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> whose major functions are connected to language and writing; peripheral agraphia may also be called nonaphasic agraphia as it involves <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> whose functions are not directly connected to language and writing (typically motor areas).|$|R
50|$|The median preoptic nucleus has {{excitatory}} and inhibitory projections to many <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> It has inhibitory influences through GABAergic projections to <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{involved in}} <b>the</b> stimulation <b>of</b> thermogenesis, {{as well as}} on wake-active <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to induce sleep. Glutamaergic and noradrenergic, as well as other neurotransmitters, have excitatory influences on other <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> <b>The</b> median preoptic nucleus is highly involved in cardiovascular regulation, including <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> atrial natriuretic peptide by the heart in response to high blood volume. It also is involved in controlling febrile response to infection and stimulation of thirst, among other functions. Both the connectivity and anatomical position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> median preoptic nucleus allow it to be both a relay station and mediator for sensory and regulatory information, and produce neural, endocrine and behavioral responses to maintain homeostasis.|$|R

5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

25|$|Research on the {{physiological}} roots of procrastination {{have been concerned}} {{with the role of}} the prefrontal cortex, the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that is responsible for executive brain functions such as impulse control, attention and planning. Which is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to exactly these functions, or lack of them. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli, from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> can reduce an individual's ability to filter out distracting stimuli and result in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, where it is commonly underactivated.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} stages after an embolic stroke, anticoagulation may be risky, as the damaged <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is {{relatively}} prone to bleeding (hemorrhagic transformation).

25|$|In {{the case}} of complex partial status epilepticus, the seizure is {{confined}} to a small <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> normally the temporal lobe.
