The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay <b>actual</b> <b>payments,</b> pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise {{that it would be}} made good after the war. Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters, when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States.|$|E

40|$|We compare two {{approaches}} to mitigating hypothetical bias. The study design includes three treatments: an <b>actual</b> <b>payment</b> treatment, a contingent valuation (CV) treatment with a follow-up certainty question, and a CV treatment with a cheap talk script. Our {{results suggest that}} both the follow-up certainty treatment and the cheap talk treatment produce willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates consistent with the <b>actual</b> <b>payment</b> treatment. However, the follow-up certainty treatment provides response distributions at all offer amounts that are statistically similar to the <b>actual</b> <b>payment</b> treatment, while the cheap talk treatment provides similar responses only at some offer amounts. Furthermore, the cheap talk treatment is effective only for inexperienced individuals. We conclude that the follow-up certainty approach is more consistent than the cheap talk approach for eliminating hypothetical bias. contingent valuation, hypothetical bias, follow-up certainty, cheap talk, nonmarket valuation, Environmental Economics and Policy, Public Economics, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R

Instead of the present mode, which is troublesome to the officer and unprofitable to the public, I propose to substitute something more effectual than rigor, which is the worst exactor in the world.

The crown will suffer no wrong {{at least from the}} pay offices; and its terrors will no longer reign over the families of those who hold or have held them. I propose that these offices should be no longer banks or treasuries, but mere offices of administration. I propose, first, that the present paymaster and the {{treasurer of}} the navy should carry into the Exchequer the whole body of the vouchers for what they have paid over to deputy-paymasters, to regimental agents, or to any of those to whom they have and ought to have paid money. I propose that those vouchers shall be admitted as <b>actual</b> <b>payments</b> in their accounts, and that the persons to whom the money has been paid shall then stand charged in the Exchequer in their place. After this process, they shall be debited or charged for nothing but the money-balance that remains in their hands.|$|E
