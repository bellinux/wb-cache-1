He is nevertheless lonely in this regard, particularly around Christmas time, though he takes solace in <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> annual appearance of Mr. Hankey, an anthropomorphic piece of feces who emerges from the sewer to spread Christmas cheer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anticipating</b> <b>the</b> rural {{background}} of most men, the initial camps provided soil conservation and farming-related projects. By August 1945, 550 men worked on dairy farms and with milk testing. Labor-intensive farming operations like dairies were short {{of workers and}} accepted COs to help fill the gap. Men assigned to the Bureau of Reclamation built contours to prevent soil erosion, constructed 164 reservoirs and 249 dams. A sixth of all CPS work was performed in this area.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, {{on the eve}} of the retrial of {{the federal}} case, Keating entered a plea agreement. He {{admitted}} to having committed four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud by extracting nearly $1 million from American Continental Corp. while already <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> collapse that happened weeks later. The federal prosecutors dropped all other charges against him and his son, Charles Keating III. He was sentenced to time served.|$|E
5|$|Allan Ramsay {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.|$|E
5|$|An astute {{politician}} {{deeply involved}} with power issues in each state, Lincoln {{reached out to}} the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election. <b>Anticipating</b> <b>the</b> war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth and died the next day. Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.|$|E

5|$|Before its release, IGN {{was highly}} <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> {{final version of}} the game as they had played two {{previous}} versions of the game already. Concentrating on the multiplayer aspect of the game, they praised the developers for moving a solely platform game into the multiplayer genre so well. Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was featured at the E3 games festival in 2004, where there was a playable demo. Only the multiplayer Siege mode and a single-player demo were available but they were enough to get 1UP.com's award for best action game at E3.|$|E
5|$|Black Hawk was {{determined}} to hold onto Saukenuk, where he lived and had been born. When the Sauks returned to the village in 1829 after their annual winter hunt in the west, they found {{that it had been}} occupied by white squatters who were <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> sale of land. After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt. Hoping to avoid further confrontations, Keokuk told Forsyth that he and his followers would not return to Saukenuk.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E

5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) {{drafted a}} Qualitative Material Requirement (QMR) for an interim, {{commercial}} off-the-shelf (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) cruise speed and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942 the Royal Navy {{formed the}} Future Building Committee, chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, {{to examine the}} fleet's {{requirements}} {{for the rest of}} the war. Tasked with <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> Navy's readiness and requirements for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft and the desire to increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large, single airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{strategic}} {{plans for a}} decisive battle with the U.S. fleet were already established by September 1944. <b>Anticipating</b> <b>the</b> various options open to American landing forces, the Japanese operational order, code named Sho ("victory"), provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between the Philippines and the Kuriles. The plan was problematic for morale, however, because it broke with IJN tradition by assigning overriding importance to sinking U.S. supply vessels rather than U.S. warships. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Soemu Toyoda flew out to the front in early October to rally the troops behind Sho.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{hiding places}} and {{makeshift}} bunkers were prepared in advance by those <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> {{fall of the}} uprising. As a result, the sequence whereby people became Robinsons closely followed the military developments of the insurrection. The first groups went into hiding in Wola during the Wola massacre and in Starówka (Warsaw Old Town), while fighting was still taking place {{in other parts of}} the city. The majority of the Robinsons hid when German forces captured the Żoliborz and Śródmieście (Warsaw City Centre) districts from the insurgents.|$|E
5|$|Palahniuk's {{novel was}} optioned by 20th Century Fox {{producer}} Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls {{to write the}} film adaptation. Fincher {{was one of four}} directors the producers considered, and was selected because of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> twist ending.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E

Led by Shinsengumi commander Hijikata Toshizō, three warships were dispatched for a surprise attack, in {{what is known as}} the Battle of Miyako Bay. The battle ended in failure for the Tokugawa side, owing to bad weather, engine trouble and the decisive use of a Gatling gun by Imperial troops against samurai boarding parties.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! staff used {{different}} {{means to}} notify Watson {{and the human}} players when to buzz, which was critical in many rounds. The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive. Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds. The humans tried {{to compensate for the}} perception delay by <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> light, but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time. Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.|$|E
5|$|When the Buffalo nickel {{had been}} struck for 25 years and could be {{replaced}} without an act of Congress, the Mint moved quickly to replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, {{and there was no}} public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. <b>Anticipating</b> <b>the</b> 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson's birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.|$|E
