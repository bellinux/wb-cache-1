5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

They have plastic spikes which <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> for the cow, causing her to reject the calf's efforts at suckling. Weaning nose rings are also available for sheep and goats. These nose rings (usually made of plastic) clip onto the nose without piercing it, and are reusable.|$|E
25|$|Emotional {{blackmail}} and FOG, terms {{coined by}} psychotherapist Susan Forward, are about controlling people in relationships {{and the theory}} that fear, obligation and guilt ("FOG") are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions {{to do things that}} <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists {{also consider the}} mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked. In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Implementing {{appropriate}} proxemic cues {{has been}} shown to improve success in monitored behavioral situations like psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see active listening). Instructional situations have likewise seen increased success in student performance by lessening the actual or perceived distance between the student and the educator (perceived distance is manipulated in the case of instructional videoconferencing, using technological tricks such as angling the frame and adjusting the zoom). Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with stigmatized minorities within a population. For example, those who do not have experience dealing with disabled persons tend to create more distance during encounters because they <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> Others may judge that the disabled person needs to have an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.|$|E

500|$|Beagles {{are used}} as {{detection}} dogs in the Beagle Brigade of the United States Department of Agriculture. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards. They are also {{used for this purpose}} {{in a number of other}} countries including by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and in Canada, Japan and the People's Republic of China.* * [...] Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited.|$|E

[...] His photos also captured his own interactions with subjects, showing how comfortable {{they were at the}} time of shooting. [...] Some subjects, such as Frank Stella, seemed to be intoxicated with the idea of being photographed by Namuth, while others, including Mark Rothko and Robert Rauschenberg, ignored Namuth during their photo sessions. [...] Other photographs exude tension between photographer and subject, as if Namuth were an unwelcome guest in their workspace, as in the cases of artists Louise Nevelson and Jasper Johns. [...] Often, Namuth's subjects <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> in front of the camera, as were [...] architects Eero Saarinen and Buckminster Fuller. [...] Almost all of Namuth's images of male artists, with the notable exception of Pollock, appear to be taking contemplative or otherwise self-absorbed poses.|$|E

This angers Krusty, {{the host of the}} show, since he thinks he should be the star of the show and not the Itchy and Scratchy characters. Meanwhile, the Simpsons visit a television museum that is soon to be closed. After a while, they come to an exhibit displaying The Adventures of Fatso Flanagan, which is one of Homer's favorite television shows. There, the family is approached by Annie Dubinsky, the agent of the actor who played Fatso Flanagan. They start chatting and become acquainted. At the Channel 6 studios, during a board meeting, Krusty is fired because [...] "Today's children <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with a clown whose every reference they have to look up on Wikipedia", and because Itchy and Scratchy are shown to be more popular with the children. Krusty goes to his current agent, hoping to get a new job, but the agent drops him since he got fired.|$|E

500|$|The two {{claim the}} show's higher {{proportion}} of instances lampooning liberal rather than conservative orthodoxies stems simply from their preference for making fun of liberals. While Stone has been quoted saying, [...] "I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals", Stone and Parker have explained that their drive to lampoon a given target comes first from the target's insistence on telling other people how to behave. The duo explain that they regard liberals as having both delusions of entitlement to remain free from satire, and a propensity to enforce political correctness while patronizing the citizens of Middle America. Parker and Stone <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> {{with the idea of}} themselves or South Park being assigned any kind of partisan classification. Parker said he rejects the [...] "South Park Republican" [...] and [...] "South Park conservative" [...] labels, feeling that either tag implies that one only adheres to strictly conservative or liberal viewpoints. Canadian columnist Jaime J. Weinman observes that the most die-hard conservatives who identified themselves as [...] "South Park Republicans" [...] began turning away from the label when the show ridiculed Republicans in the season nine (2005) episode [...] "Best Friends Forever." ...|$|E

Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself.

500|$|Part One of the book, titled [...] "Encounter," [...] {{opens with}} Irene {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} Clare Kendry, causing her to recall a chance encounter she had had with her, at the roof restaurant of the Drayton Hotel in Chicago, during a brief stay in the city. The women grew up together but lost touch when Clare's white father died and she was taken {{to live with her}} two paternal white aunts. Irene learns that Clare [...] "passes" [...] for white, living primarily in Europe with her unsuspecting, rich, white husband and their daughter. Although Irene tries to avoid further engagement with Clare, she never is able to fully exclude her from her life as she later visits Clare for tea along with another childhood friend, Gertrude Martin. Toward the end of the visit, Clare's white husband John (Jack) Bellew arrives. Unaware that all three women are black, Jack expresses some very racist views and makes the women uneasy. However, the women play along in an effort to maintain Clare's secret identity. Afterward, Irene and Gertrude decide that Clare's situation is too dangerous for them to continue associating with her and <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> around Clare and her husband [...] Irene receives a letter of apology from Clare but destroys it and in her quest to try and forget about Clare and get her out of her life. Instead Irene wants to focus on her life [...] with her husband, Brian, and her two sons, Theodore and Brian Jr..|$|E
