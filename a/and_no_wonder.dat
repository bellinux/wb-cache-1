[...] At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. [...] We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. [...] The problem was {{to get it in}} exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder.</b> [...] That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.|$|E
500|$|According to Bertram Davis, [...] "For {{every person}} who remembers Sir John Hawkins {{as the author of}} the first {{full-length}} biography of Samuel Johnson, many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'." [...] Although [...] "unclubable" [...] reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: [...] "As we were returning from the meadows that day, I remember we met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> for I have often heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" [...] Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.|$|E

2500|$|On Rotten Tomatoes {{the film}} has a rating of 11% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The film was given a Two Thumbs Down on Siskel & Ebert, with Gene Siskel noted that the film's {{animation}} looks [...] "cheap and unfinished" [...] and that [...] "none of the songs are memorable" [...] while Roger Ebert added his dislike of the [...] "dumb songs", [...] "silly story", and the film's color-coding of its heroes and villains. Ebert took this a step further by arguing [...] "What do kids learn from this? Nothing overt. Just a quiet, unstated impression: White is good and brave, and brown is scheming and negative. Reinforce that through lots of cartoons (examples: Aladdin and The Rescuers Down Under) <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> even black children choose white dolls in some psychological experiments". Deseret News said, [...] "the songs are forgettable, the story one-note and the characterizations quite weak". The Austin Chronicle said the film [...] "lacks dramatic structure and narrative drive: Songs and animated action pieces are narratively connected but the film doesn't feel as though it is an organic whole. All the elements are here, they just don't come together". Time Out said [...] "The characterisations are weak and unendearing. Worse, the big 'action' sequences turn up with the pacing and predictability of clock chimes. And, in what is perhaps the last great medium for musicals, the perfunctoriness of Barry Manilow's songs and arrangements seem guaranteed to put off yet another generation". The New York Times wrote that 4 would be [...] "the optimum age for viewers of this gentle, animated musical", adding that [...] "the action seems flat and low-rent compared to those earlier movies", and that it [...] "doesn't have the vivid characters, first-rate animation or sense of adventure that turns movies like The Lion King into endlessly watchable favorites".|$|E
