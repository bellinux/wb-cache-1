The Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) {{is the first to}} be completed. SSCE will study flame spreading over thermally thin fuels (<b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper)</b> under microgravity conditions. The flight hardware consists of a combustion chamber containing the sample and a computer which takes the data and controls the experiment.

The system comprises a fiberglass pod containing a comfortable restraint couch for the animal. The pod {{is divided into}} upper and lower halves. When the monkey occupies the couch, a rubber belly-band forms a gas seal between {{the upper and lower}} portions of the animal. The upper-pod ventilating air stream is monitored for the partial pressures of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water to permit continuous metabolic gas-exchange measurements for computation of metabolic energy expediture.

30|$|Solution {{chemistry}} {{was measured}} on soil samples (0 cm to 10 cm depth) collected in early June 2010 {{from the center}} of each pile. Samples were sieved to 2 mm, then extracted with deionized water (60 ml water: 20 g soil) for 30 minutes using a wrist-action shaker (Burrell Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), filtered using <b>ashless</b> quantitative filter <b>paper</b> (2.5 µm pore size; Whatman Inc., Florham Park, New Jersey, USA), and stored at 4 °C prior to analysis. Water samples from the ZTL and overland flow collectors were filtered using <b>ashless</b> quantitative filter <b>paper</b> prior to analysis. Soluble anions and cations were analyzed using ion chromatography (DX 500; Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, California, USA). Anion analysis followed US EPA Method 300.0 protocols (EPA 1993) using a Dionex IonPac AS 4 A anion exchange column, carbonate-bicarbonate eluent, and suppressed conductivity detection. Cation analysis was accomplished using a Dionex IonPac CS 12 A cation exchange column, methanesulfonic acid eluent, and suppressed conductivity detection described in ASTM International (2003).|$|R
30|$|Silica was {{extracted}} from maize husk ash and maize stem ash, adapting {{the method of}} Kamath and Proctor (1998), 250  mL portions of 1  N NaOH were added to 50  g of the ash samples and boiled in covered 500  mL Erlenmeyer flask for 1  h with constant stirring. The solutions were filtered through a Whatman no. 41 <b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper.</b> The filtrate was allowed to cool and the pH was reduced with 3  N HCl to 7.0 with constant stirring and incubated to promote gel formation. The formed gel was aged for 18  h. The soft gel was broken and the slurry was centrifuged at 4000  rpm for 5  min. The supernatant was discarded and the gels transferred into a beaker and dried at 80  °C for 24  h to produce xerogels. The xerogels were subjected to additional washing with deionized water to effectively remove minerals and impurity from the silica.|$|R
40|$|An {{intensified}} array camera {{has been}} used to image weakly luminous flames spreading over thermally thin paper samples in a low-gravity environment aboard the NASA-Lewis Learjet. The aircraft offers 10 to 20 sec of reduced gravity during execution of a Keplerian trajectory and allows the use of instrumentation that is delicate or requires higher electrical power than is available in drop towers. The intensified array camera is a charge intensified device type that responds to light between 400 and 900 nm and has a minimum sensitivity of 10 (exp 6) footcandles. The <b>paper</b> sample, either <b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper</b> or a lab wiper, burns inside a sealed chamber which is filled with 21, 18, or 15 pct. oxygen in nitrogen at one atmosphere. The camera views the edge of the paper and its output is recorded on videotape. Flame positions are measured every 0. 1 sec to calculate flame spread rates. Comparisons with drop tower data indicate that the flame shapes and spread rates are affected by the residual g level in the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Opposed-flow {{flame spread}} over solid fuels is a {{fundamental}} area of research in fire science. Typically combustion wind tunnels are used to generate the opposing flow of oxidizer against which a laminar flame spread occurs along the fuel samples. The spreading flame is generally embedded in a laminar boundary layer, which interacts with the strong buoyancy-induced flow to affect the mechanism of flame spread. In this work, two different approaches for creating the opposed-flow are compared. In the first approach, a vertical combustion tunnel is used where a thin fuel sample, thin acrylic or <b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper,</b> is held vertically along the axis of the test-section with the airflow controlled by controlling the duty cycles of four fans. As the sample is ignited, a flame spreads downward in a steady manner along a developing boundary layer. In the second approach, the sample is held in a movable cart placed in an eight-meter tall vertical chamber filled with air. As the sample is ignited, the cart is moved downward (through a remote-controlled mechanism) at a prescribed velocity. The results from the two approaches are compared to establish the boundary layer effect on flame spread over thin fuels...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{radiometry}} is {{an established}} technique for noncontact temperature measurement of solids. We adapt this technique {{to the study}} of solid surface combustion where the solid fuel undergoes physical and chemical changes as pyrolysis proceeds, and additionally may produce soot. The physical and chemical changes alter the fuel surface emissivity, and soot contributes to the infrared signature in the same spectral band as the signal of interest. We have developed a measurement that isolates the fuel's surface emissions in the presence of soot, and determine the surface emissivity as a function of temperature. A commercially available infrared camera images the two-dimensional surface of <b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper</b> burning in concurrent flow. The camera is sensitive in the 2 to 5 gm band, but spectrally filtered to reduce the interference from hot gas phase combustion products. Results show a strong functional dependence of emissivity on temperature, attributed to the combined effects of thermal and oxidative processes. Using the measured emissivity, radiance measurements from several burning samples were corrected for the presence of soot and for changes in emissivity, to yield quantitative surface temperature measurements. Ultimately the results will be used to develop a full-field, non-contact temperature measurement that will be used in spacebased combustion investigations...|$|R
40|$|The Radiative Ignition and Transition to Spread Investigation (RITSI) is {{a shuttle}} middeck Glovebox {{combustion}} experiment {{developed by the}} NASA Lewis Research Center, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), and Aerospace Design and Fabrication (ADF). It is scheduled to fly on the third United States Microgravity Payload (USMP- 3) mission in February 1996. The objective of RITSI is to experimentally study radiative ignition and the subsequent transition to flame spread in low gravity {{in the presence of}} very low speed air flows in two- and three-dimensional configurations. Toward this objective, a unique collaboration between NASA, NIST, and the University of Hokkaido was established to conduct 15 science and engineering tests in Japan's 10 -sec drop shaft. For these tests, the RITSI engineering hardware was mounted in a sealed chamber with a variable oxygen atmosphere. <b>Ashless</b> filter <b>paper</b> was ignited during each drop by a tungsten-halogen heat lamp focused on a small spot {{in the center of the}} paper.

30|$|In the {{preparation}} of thiourea-functionalized silica, the derived silica was first acid treated to activate the surface silanol (Si–OH) groups. 10  g of silica was added to 100  mL of deionized distilled water and the solution pH was adjusted to 4.0 using 0.1  N nitric acid. The mixture was heated (50 – 60  °C) with continuous stirring for 3  h. Silica was separated by filtering the mixture using Whatman no. 41 <b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper.</b> The silica cake was washed with 25  mL of deionized distilled water twice and then heated in an oven at 120  °C for 8 – 12  h. The dried silica was used for further silanization. A dry phase deposition method was used to functionalize the silica particles. The particles were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol (15  mL of ethanol per gram of silica) and thiourea was dissolved such that {{the ratio of the}} amount of silica (in g) to the amount of thiourea was 7 : 3. Ultra high purity grade nitrogen was bubbled through the mixture to evaporate the ethanol under fume hood, thus depositing thiol –SH {{on the surface of the}} silica. For the silanization reaction, the silica was then placed in oven at 120  °C for 8 – 10  h. The material was allowed to cool and washed twice with 50  mL of anhydrous ethanol to remove any physically adsorbed thiourea and dried again in an oven.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn insect, host-finding is {{initiated}} by selectively laying eggs in particular site, {{which is known}} as oviposition. Host preference in lyctines is determined by some features like vessel size, moisture and starch content of the targeted host. Limited information {{is available on the}} significance of diet quality other than starch towards oviposition ability and fecundity of the lyctines. This study discusses the effects of nutritional quality of diets on oviposition of Lyctus africanus after feeding with cellulose-, cellulose powder (CP) and alpha cellulose (AC), and wood-based diets. Oviposition test was conducted on quantitative <b>ashless</b> filter <b>papers</b> which served as oviposition sites. The filter papers had been impregnated with nutritive solution and water to attract females laying their eggs. Those oviposition sites were put separately into a plastic jar with 10 pairs of lyctines adult. Then the eggs number and survived adults after two weeks were observed. The results showed that lyctine adults emerged from the cellulose-based diets ovipositing more eggs significantly on nutritive solution- than water-impregnated filter papers. This result may confirm that starch and sugar are the vital nutrients for L. africanus which could attract adult females to lay their eggs. The cellulose-based diets, both CP- and AC-based diet, are likely to affect adult stage of L. africanus to be more fecund by laying more eggs on filter papers. Also, CP-based diet generated the adults with higher survivals after ovipositing the eggs on both nutritive content and water-impregnated filter paper. The diet composition, in the case of cellulose content, is thus suggested to influence the fecundity of the adult insects of L. africanus...|$|R
30|$|For {{the second}} set of the catalysts, the {{concentrations}} of cobalt and ruthenium were fixed at 15 and 1  wt.%, respectively. The catalysts were prepared by microemulsion technique with aqueous solutions of cobalt nitrate [CO(NO 3) 2 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O% 99, Merck] (Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) and ruthenium nitrosil nitrate [Ru(NO)(NO 3) 3] (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Ruthenium-promoted cobalt nanoparticles were synthesized in a reverse microemulsion using a nonionic surfactant Triton X- 100 (Chem-Lab, Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK), n-hexane [C 6 H 14] (Chem-Lab) as the oil phase and 1 -butanol [C 4 H 9 OH] (Merck) as the co-surfactant. The water-to-surfactant molar ratio (W/S) was varied from 0.5 to 1.5. After vigorous stirring, a microemulsion was obtained (15  min). Hydrazine was added in excess (hydrazine/Co[*]=[*] 10) to improve nanoparticle formation in the core of the micelles by reducing the metal oxides. Then, the appropriate weight of purified carbon nanotubes was added under stirring. During 3  h of stirring, tetrahydrofurane (THF), an emulsion destabilizing agent, was added dropwise (1  ml/min). A fast addition could lead to fast particle agglomeration and uncontrolled particle deposition on the support (CNTs). The mixture was left to mature and settle slowly overnight and then decanted. The solid sample was recovered by vacuum filtration using <b>ashless</b> filtration <b>paper</b> (Whatman 1; Whatman plc, Maidstone, Kent, UK) and washed several times with distilled water ethanol. In order to remove the remaining traces of surfactant and ammonia, the catalysts were dried at 120 °C for 2  h and calcined under argon (Ar) flow at 450 °C for 3  h and slowly exposed to an oxygen atmosphere during the cooling step. The catalysts prepared by this procedure were signified as C 4, C 5, C 6, C 7, and C 8 for a W/S ratio of 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 1.50, respectively (see Table  2).|$|R
40|$|The Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) was {{the first}} {{combustion}} experiment to fly in the space shuttle and the first such experiment in the NASA spaceflight program since Skylab. SSCE was actually a series of experiments designed to begin to characterize flame spreading over solid fuels in microgravity and the differences of this flame spreading from normal gravity behavior. These experiments should lead {{to a better understanding}} of the physical processes involved [...] increasing our understanding of fire behavior, both in space and on Earth. SSCE results will help researchers evaluate spacecraft fire hazards. These experiments were conceived by the principal investigator, Professor Robert A. Altenkirch, Dean of Engineering at Washington State University. In the first five flights, the fuel sample [...] <b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper</b> instrumented with three thermocouples [...] was mounted in a sealed chamber filled with a 50 -percent or 35 -percent mixture of oxygen in nitrogen at pressures of 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 atm. In the next three flights, a polymethyl methacrylate (plexiglass) fuel was instrumented with three thermocouples and tested in a 70 -percent or 50 -percent mixture of oxygen and nitrogen at pressures of 1. 0 and 2. 0 atm. SSCE is a self-contained, battery-operated experiment that can be flown either in the shuttle middeck or in the Spacelab module. More information about the hardware configuration have been published. This past year, the final two of eight flights were completed on STS- 64 and STS- 63. The NASA Lewis Research Center designed and built the SSCE payload and performed engineering, testing, scientific, and flight operations support. The SSCE project was supported in some way by nearly every major sector of Lewis' organization. Professor Altenkirch developed a numerical simulation of the flame-spreading process from first principles (of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and reaction kinetics). The spread rates, flame shape, and thermodynamic data from the SSCE flights are being compared directly with the results of the computational model. Results from the eight flights will be used to formulate an improved solid-phase pyrolysis model. In addition, some results of the flights have been published and presented at international combustion symposiums. Additional solid fuel combustion experiments are being investigated for future tests with the existing hardware...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{environment}} in which flame spreading, a phenomenon of fundamental, scientific interest, has importance to fire safety is that of spacecraft in which the gravitational acceleration is low {{compared with that of}} the Earth, i. e., microgravity. Experiments aboard eight Space Shuttle missions between October 1990 and February 1995 were conducted using the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) payload apparatus in an effort to determine the mechanisms of gas-phase flame spread over solid fuel surfaces {{in the absence of any}} buoyancy induced or externally imposed oxidizer flow. The overall SSCE effort began in December of 1984. The SSCE apparatus consists of a sealed container, approximately 0. 039 cu m, that is filled with a specified O 2 /N 2 mixture at a prescribed pressure. Five of the experiments used a thin cellulosic fuel, <b>ashless</b> filter <b>paper,</b> 3 cm wide x 10 cm long, 0. 00825 cm half-thickness, ignited in five different ambient conditions. Three of the experiments, the most recent, used thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) samples 0. 635 cm wide x 2 cm long, 0. 32 cm half-thickness. Three experiments, STS 41, 40 and 43, were designed to evaluate the effect of ambient pressure on flame spread over the thin cellulosic fuel while flights STS 50 and 47 were at the same pressure as two of the earlier flights but at a lower oxygen concentration in order to evaluate the effect of ambient oxygen level on the flame spread process at microgravity. For the PMMA flights, two experiments, STS 54 and 63, were at the same pressure but different oxygen concentrations while STS 64 was at the same oxygen concentration as STS 63 but at a higher pressure. Two orthogonal views of the experiments were recorded on 16 mm cine-cameras operating at 24 frames/s. In addition to filmed images of the side view of the flames and surface view of the burning samples, solid- and gas-phase temperatures were recorded using thermocouples. The experiment is battery powered and follows an automated sequence upon activation by the Shuttle Crew. In this study we separate the SSCE data into two groups according to the fuel type: (1) thin cellulose; and (2) thick PMMA. The experimental spread rates are compared with prediction from a number of models in an effort to uncover the important physics that characterize microgravity flame spread. Both steady and unsteady solutions are employed to explore the flame evolution, especially for thick fuels. Finally, the flame structure in downward spread is compared with the microgravity flame structure and modeling results to delineate the difference between the two configurations and the influence of normal gravity...|$|R
