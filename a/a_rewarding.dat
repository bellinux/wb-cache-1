5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} received mixed reviews. Prell {{thought that}} the mission-design was varied, and the voting system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, noting that the items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner {{thought that the}} action featured in this mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode <b>a</b> <b>rewarding</b> experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E

25|$|Both {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} strengthen behavior, or increase {{the probability of}} a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (negative reinforcement). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences. Extinction is the absence of <b>a</b> <b>rewarding</b> stimulus, which weakens behavior.|$|E

It was the first fish species in the Missouri River drainage area to be listed as endangered, {{and a loss of}} its habitat is thought to be responsible for its decline. The vast majority of the Missouri River drainage system has been channeled and dammed, reducing the gravel deposits and slow-moving side channels that are its favored spawning areas.

[...] Musician and author Peter Lavezzoli described the Byrds in 2007 as [...] "one of the few bands to exert a decisive influence on the Beatles", while also noting that they helped to persuade Bob Dylan to begin recording with electric instrumentation. [...] Lavezzoli concluded that [...] "like it or not, terms like [...] "folk rock," [...] "raga rock" [...] and [...] "country rock" [...] were coined for a reason: the Byrds did it first, and then kept moving, never staying in the [...] "raga" [...] or [...] "country" [...] mode for very long.

500|$|Within the brain, {{dopamine}} functions {{partly as}} a [...] "global reward signal", where an initial phasic dopamine response to <b>a</b> <b>rewarding</b> stimulus encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a reward prediction error signal, that is, {{the degree to which}} the value of a reward is unexpected. According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level. The [...] "prediction error" [...] hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error. This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in machine learning.|$|E

G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title.

500|$|In {{the reward}} system, reward is the {{attractive}} and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior [...] (also known as approach behavior) – and consummatory behavior. <b>A</b> <b>rewarding</b> stimulus {{is one that}} has the potential to cause an approach to it and a choice to be made to consume it or not. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, pleasure provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinstic rewards like money). The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasurable component of intrinstic rewards is derived from the consummatory behavior that ensues upon acquiring them. [...] A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where [...] "wanting" [...] or desire (less commonly, [...] "seeking") corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior.}} In human drug addicts, [...] "wanting" [...] becomes dissociated with [...] "liking" [...] as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance.|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} reinforcement learning, <b>a</b> <b>reward</b> function {{influences the}} learning results, and therefore, the reward function is very important. To design this function considering a task, knowledge of reinforcement learning is required. In addition to this, <b>a</b> <b>reward</b> function must be designed for each task.

We focus on this problemand aim at realizing a method to generate <b>a</b> <b>reward</b> without the design of <b>a</b> special <b>reward</b> function.

Instead of the design of <b>a</b> <b>reward</b> function, our approach assists a human being in learning how to interact with an agent and teaching it his/her demand.

The results show that a participant can teach an agent his/her demand by interacting with the agent and the agent can generate an adaptive route by interacting with the participant and the environment...|$|R
