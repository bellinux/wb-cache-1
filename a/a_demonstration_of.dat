5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E

5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased {{in proportion to the}} size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E

5|$|His {{policies}} and tactics highlighted {{and increased the}} separation between the king and his subjects. Andrianjaka transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom. He made <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> royal power by appropriating the local tradition of sampy (talismans), previously created by village chiefs and others for personal or local spiritual ends, restricting their number to twelve and declaring their creation a strictly royal prerogative. The king also imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the trial by ordeal: Andrianjaka ordered that rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was {{sufficiently}} impressed to persuade his brothers {{to agree to}} experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E
5|$|In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries {{to all the}} Greek city-states, {{asking for}} a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their {{submission}} to him. Having had <b>a</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well. This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia.|$|E
