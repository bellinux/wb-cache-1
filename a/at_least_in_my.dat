500|$|Wario World {{received}} fairly positive reviews. The US {{version of}} Play magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that Wario World [...] "pays off every second [...] holding the controller, and that, to , is greatness". Nintendo Power {{said that the}} game was [...] "tons of fun". GamePro stated that Wario World [...] "stays addictive by weight of sheer design innovation". The American-based publication Game Informer praised the game for including [...] "droves of awesome boss battles". Matt Casamassina of IGN declared that Wario World had [...] "some great control mechanics and inventive level work". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Greg Ford said, [...] "Wario [...] delivers a great time while it lasts and is well worth checking out. Just don't expect a Mario-quality adventure". Worthplaying gave the game 9 out 10, stating that [...] "Treasure has done itself proud with this title, and Wario himself can lift his head up high. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> book, he's got at least one game that's better than Mario's." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{supporting}} tour for 9, Mercyful Fate {{was put on}} hiatus. King Diamond focused on his eponymous band, along with guitarist Mike Wead, who joined the group during the European House of God tour. Hank Shermann and Bjarne T. Holm reunited with Michael Denner to form Force of Evil, while Sharlee D'Angelo joined the band Arch Enemy. When asked about {{the current state of}} the band in 2008, Diamond stated that Mercyful Fate is currently [...] "hibernating", and that [...] "it's definitely not finished, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> book." [...] In August 2008, King Diamond was asked by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich if Mercyful Fate would be willing to participate in Activision's [...] video game. Ulrich requested the original masters for two of the band's songs, so they could be used in the game. Unable to locate them, Diamond suggested to Activision the band re-record the songs, and as a result, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner, Timi Hansen and Bjarne T. Holm reunited to re-record the songs [...] "Evil" [...] and [...] "Curse of the Pharaohs". King Diamond was also made into a playable character in the game.|$|E
2500|$|While still {{attending}} Franklin in 1943, Capote {{began working}} as a copyboy in the art department at The New Yorker, a job he held {{for two years before}} being fired for angering poet Robert Frost. Years later, he reminisced, [...] "Not a very grand job, for all it really involved was sorting cartoons and clipping newspapers. Still, I was fortunate to have it, especially since I was determined never to set a studious foot inside a college classroom. I felt that either one was or wasn't a writer, and no combination of professors could influence the outcome. I still think I was correct, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own case." [...] He left his job to live with relatives in Alabama and began writing his first novel, Summer Crossing.|$|E

5000|$|The bar line is much, {{much more}} than a mere accent, and I don't believe that it can be {{simulated}} by an accent, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> debt," [...] cried Mademoiselle, {{now making}} a step forward, and {{sustained}} by an excitement born of hope. [...] "Whatever may be my father's sins, M. la Boulaye, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> will {{not seek to}} visit them upon the daughter, for he owes his life to me, and he will not forget the debt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only one can go, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cariole," [...] remarked Lambert, [...] "for it only holds two, {{and no one}} {{can drive}} Black Dick but myself." ...|$|E
60|$|With Bewick on my knee, I {{was then}} happy: happy <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast- room door opened.|$|E
60|$|I had now {{completely}} {{got over}} my sea-sickness, and felt very well; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> body, though {{my heart was}} far from feeling right; so that I could now look around me, and make observations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in {{the sense}} you mean, Sergeant--no, not in that p'int of view; never! <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion. I know that natur' is weak--human natur', I mean--and that we should none of us vaunt of our gifts, whether red or white; but I do not think a truer-hearted lad lives on the lines than Jasper Western." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} the art of continuous-time filter design is reviewed. Several {{techniques}} are discussed and compared in terms of performance an implementation feasibility in different fabrication technologies. This review does not aim at historical completeness, but rather emphasizes techniques that have proven their worth in commercial applications or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> show, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion of the author, promise for the future...|$|R
6000|$|He.--And {{that is what}} I said: the atrocity of {{the action}} carries [...] you beyond contempt, and hence my sincerity. I wished you to know [...] to what a degree I excelled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> art, to extort from you the [...] {{admission}} that I was <b>at</b> <b>least</b> original <b>in</b> <b>my</b> abasement, to rank me [...] in your mind on {{the line of the}} great good-for-noughts, and to hail [...] me henceforth--Vivat Mascarillus, fourbum imperator! ...|$|R
60|$|Har. Never {{any thing}} of moment {{was done at}} our council-table without a leaking tub, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time; great affairs require great {{consultations}}, great consultations require great drinking, and great drinking a great leaking vessel.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} fear that my {{presence}} will offend you much longer, mademoiselle," [...] he said coldly. [...] "I can quite understand how hateful {{it must be}} to you, though I would have wished that you could believe <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sincerity." ...|$|E
60|$|Some of {{my friends}} (H.C. for instance) doubt whether poetry on {{contemporary}} persons and events can be good. But I instance Spenser's 'Marriage,' and Milton's 'Lycidas.' True, the 'Persae' {{is one of the}} worst of Aeschylus's plays; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would to}} Heaven," [...] he {{repeated}} in conclusion, [...] "I {{could have come}} in time to save you from becoming his wife. But <b>at</b> <b>least</b> it is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power to make you very speedily his widow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>in</b> Heaven's name, <b>my</b> good friend, tell it me,' said Nicholas. 'For God's sake {{consider}} my deplorable condition; and, while I promise {{to take no}} step without taking counsel with you, give me, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> a vote <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own behalf.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me of them all," [...] she said. [...] "I {{have heard}} naught of them since we left Tutbury, where <b>at</b> <b>least</b> we were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Lord's house, and the dear old silver dog was on every sleeve. Ah! there he is, the trusty rogue." ...|$|R

6000|$|And in the {{delirium}} of the moment, I {{began to}} indulge in foolish golden visions of the counts and countesses to whom Harry might introduce me; and every instant I expected to hear the waiters addressing some gentleman as [...] "My Lord," [...] or [...] "four Grace."

6000|$|... "You {{are really}} most generous," [...] went on Ida {{in the same}} bitter tone, the irony of which made her father wince, for he {{understood}} her mood better than did her lover. [...] "I only regret that I cannot appreciate such generosity more than I do. But it is <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power {{to give you the}} return which you deserve. So I can no longer hesitate, but once and for all----" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} kill that gnawing pain of suspicion. I thought if I stood up before them and cried out that <b>my</b> trust <b>in</b> you was so great, I was willing to marry you {{notwithstanding}} everything, I should <b>at</b> <b>least</b> have peace <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own heart.|$|R
60|$|We rode a few miles, {{and then}} Matteo turned back. When I found myself alone I heaved a great sigh of relief. I was free {{for a while}} <b>at</b> <b>least....</b> Another episode <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life was finished; I could forget it, {{and look forward to}} new things.|$|R
6000|$|Briefly he {{told her}} how Sir Richard Everard had cared for him, for his mother's sake; endowed him richly upon {{adopting}} him, and since made him heir to all his wealth, which was considerable. [...] "And for the rest, madam, and you, Rotherby, set doubts on one side. Your ladyship says that had my lord had a son you must have heard of it. But my lord, madam, never {{knew he had a}} son. Tell me--can you recall the date, the month <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>in</b> which <b>my</b> lord returned to England?" ...|$|R
60|$|The plaster Venuses and Apollos {{that used}} to adorn the vast aisle and huge grey {{terraces}} of the Crystal Palace were the first intimations of {{the beauty of the}} body that ever came into my life. As I write of it I feel again the shameful attraction of those gracious forms. I used to look at them not simply, but curiously and askance. Once <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> later days at Penge, I spent a shilling in admission chiefly for the sake of them....|$|E
60|$|And {{whatever}} is good {{is led by}} the manager of the works, whose influence over the workmen's minds has never failed. Even when he talked to me on that day, I thought there was a change in his tone. He had never sneered (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hearing) nor questioned other men's faith, but when he told me of Harold his manner had something of awe, as well as of sorrow and admiration, and I could not but think that a sense had dawned out that the spiritual was a reality, and an absolute power over the material.|$|E
60|$|You may observe, that I {{have very}} superficially touched the subject I began with, {{and with the}} utmost caution: for I know how {{criminal}} the least complaint hath been thought, however seasonable or just, or honestly intended, which hath forced me to offer up my daily prayers, that it may never, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time, be interpreted by innuendoes as a false scandalous, seditious, and disaffected action, {{for a man to}} roar under an acute fit of the gout, which beside the loss and the danger, would be very inconvenient to one of my age, so severely afflicted with that distemper.|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Hester, an {{authority}} on family history, described him thus: [...] "I don't recollect that he ever did anything; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time. He was er--an owner of houses, my dear. His hair about your Uncle Swithin's colour; rather a square build. Tall? No--not very tall" [...] (he had been five feet five, with a mottled face); [...] "a fresh-coloured man. I remember he used to drink Madeira; but ask your Aunt Ann. What was his father? He--er--had {{to do with the}} land down in Dorsetshire, by the sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I've {{made up my}} mind," [...] Herminia answered, with a faint tremor in her maidenly voice, {{but with}} hardly a trace now of a traitorous blush, where no blush was needed. [...] "I've made up my mind, Alan; and from all we had said and talked over together, I thought you <b>at</b> <b>least</b> would sympathize <b>in</b> <b>my</b> resolve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “My dear sir,” {{interrupted}} Mellowkent, “there are <b>at</b> <b>least</b> {{four men}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> club {{who can not}} only tell me what horse won in any given year, but what horse ought to have won and why it didn’t. If your book could supply a method for protecting one from information of that sort it would do more than anything you have yet claimed for it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe. That is {{a matter}} {{between him and the}} gods which I leave them to settle. The oath he swore to-day is not one to be lightly broken. But whether he breaks it or not, I also swore an oath, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart, namely that I would not attempt to dispute the will of Pharaoh whom, after all, I love as my father and honour as my king, Pharaoh who still lives and may, as I hope, recover. What should I say to him if he {{recovered}} or, at the worst, when at last we meet elsewhere?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Denver episode {{has never}} {{found its way}} here, I think. I know {{the most of the}} men in camp, and they have never {{referred}} to it, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles, and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one--he who was so fond of company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several times recently--drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic figure. He calls himself David Wilson.|$|E
60|$|I {{like your}} way in your churchyard lucubrations. Thoughts {{that are the}} {{spontaneous}} result of accidental situations, either respecting health, place, or company, have often a strength, and always an originality, that would in vain be looked for in fancied circumstances, and studied paragraphs. For me, I have often thought of keeping a letter, in progression by me, to send you when the sheet was written out. Now I talk of sheets, I must tell you, my reason for writing to you on paper of this kind is my pruriency of writing to you at large. A page of post is on such a dis-social, narrow-minded scale, that I cannot abide it; and double letters, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> miscellaneous reverie manner, are a monstrous tax in a close correspondence.

5000|$|When I ask {{the manager}} or {{commercial}} teller {{if they want}} to be the next to die, and they can smell the acrid smoke of the gunpowder, and sometimes feel the warmth of the gun barrel next to their skin [...] [...] [...] they feel pretty certain that I have just shot a customer, or have <b>at</b> <b>least</b> shot someone <b>in</b> <b>my</b> past.

500|$|The {{failure of}} the Cray-3 was in large {{part due to the}} {{changing}} political and technical climate. The machine was being designed during the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and ending of the cold war, which led to a massive downsizing in supercomputer purchases. At the same time, the market was increasingly investing in massively parallel (MP or MPP) designs. Cray was critical of this approach, and was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying that MPP systems had not yet proven their supremacy over vector computers, noting the difficulty many users have had programming for large parallel machines.

40|$|AbstractCan {{geometry}} {{help students}} learn linear algebra? I study this question and demonstrate {{that there is no}} obvious clear answer: geometry can be an obstacle to learning linear algebra; or it can be helpful. Geometry is helpful only under certain conditions and with a specific use of drawings. These special requirements for using geometry are apparently not much recognized in our teaching of linear algebra courses, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> France, where <b>my</b> educational studies have taken place...|$|R
