The liquidity effect, foreign interest revenue effect and interest rate income effect which are all caused by change in the nominal money supply are the key factors affecting the possible <b>adjustment</b> <b>paths</b> of relevant macroeconomic variables.

The deadlines for EDP abrogations will only be extended if extraordinary circumstances occur - like a recession or severe economic downturn.
