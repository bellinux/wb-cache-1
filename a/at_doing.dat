Drawn toward politics and the women's suffrage movement by her friend Sara Bard Field, she joined the Oregon branch of the College Equal Suffrage League in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual Flag Day parade. Led by Abigail Scott Duniway, women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been {{compared}} by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed <b>at</b> <b>doing</b> as much damage as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league <b>at</b> <b>doing</b> so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E

25|$|Persisting {{with further}} {{attempts}} {{to convince the}} composer, Ricordi had also broached {{the idea of a}} collaboration with Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare's Othello.

Because of its relatively straightforward story, the play Othello was selected as a likely target.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s to 1970s, the {{development}} of miniaturized solid-state components allowed synthesizers to become self-contained, portable instruments, as proposed by Harald Bode in 1961. By the early 1980s, companies were selling compact, modestly priced synthesizers to the public. This, along with {{the development of}} Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments for use in musical composition. In the 1990s, synthesizer emulations began to appear in computer software, known as software synthesizers. From 1996 onward, Steinberg's Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plug-ins – {{and a host of other}} kinds of competing plug-in software, all designed to run on personal computers – began emulating classic hardware synthesizers, becoming increasingly successful <b>at</b> <b>doing</b> so during the following decades.|$|E

According to Hamasaki, she had imagined recording a cover for a studio album, but was unsuccessful <b>at</b> <b>doing</b> so.

500|$|The song earned {{mixed reviews}} from critics. A staff of Tourdates.co.uk gave a {{favorable}} review commending Ribbons' vocal display.

He remarked that Ribbons [...] "fails" [...] <b>at</b> <b>doing</b> [...] "sexy R'n'B". Similarly, Julie MacCaskill of the Daily Record dismissed it as [...] "a lacklustre affair with the wannabe star ditching her Mariah sound- a-like singing in favour of becoming a Kylie clone". The single debuted at number nineteen on the UK Singles Chart, the week dated January 25, 2003. The position became its peak position. The following week, the song dropped to number thirty-seven and the week after exited the top forty.|$|E

In the [...] "questions and answers" [...] section on his website, Welker revealed that the reason he stopped performing as Santa's Little Helper was because [...] "The producers thought...
