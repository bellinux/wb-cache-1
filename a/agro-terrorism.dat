50|$|CBP Agriculture Specialists receive 11 {{weeks of}} paid {{training}} at the Professional Development Center in Frederick, Maryland {{as well as a}} post-academy training phase that varies in length according to their assigned port. Agriculture Specialists are stationed at international ports of entry located at airports, seaports, and land borders throughout the U.S. and along the Canadian and Mexican borders; they are also stationed overseas in various countries authorized by the United States to have the traveling public and agricultural commodities pre-cleared before entering into the United States. They are uniformed federal officers with the authority to conduct random inspections of luggage or items entering the country and the power to seize prohibited or contaminated items. Agricultural Specialists issue civil fines, {{not to be confused with}} collecting duty or tax, to both international travelers and commercial entities in accordance with the federal laws CFR 7 & 9; they do not however collect duty taxes. Although Agriculture Specialists work for and are sworn to uphold and enforce the laws governed under the jurisdiction of Customs and Border Protection, they are also tasked with enforcing the laws governed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). They serve as expert and technical consultants in the areas of inspection, intelligence, analysis, examination and law enforcement activities related to the importation of agricultural/commercial commodities and conveyances at the various ports of entry. Agriculture Specialists apply a wide range of federal, state and local laws and agency regulations, including those of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when determining the admissibility of agricultural commodities, or commodities in general, while regulating and/or preventing the introduction of restricted/prohibited products, harmful pests, diseases and potential <b>agro-terrorism</b> into the United States. They participate in special enforcement, targeting, and analysis teams charged with collecting and analyzing information and identifying high-risk targets; or conduct visual and physical inspections of cargo, conveyances or passenger baggage. The Agriculture Specialist plans, conducts, and supervises remedial actions such as treating, disinfecting and decontaminating prohibited commodities, conveyances, contaminants or agricultural materials.|$|E

This article presents an overview of food safety issues, and develops an economic model that can be used to illustrate and establish hypotheses regarding consumer behaviour and <b>agro-terrorism.</b> We then present sample and econometric results from a survey of 304 New Jersey consumers and explain the characteristics of the 33 % that confirmed that they have increased purchases of locally grown produce due to terrorism fears. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, the media, {{government}} leaders, scholars and national security analysts have all {{called attention to the}} potential threat presented by terrorism. In general, analyses have focused on the use of biological agents to kill or injure people. Consequently, the intentional contamination of crops by biological agents has received less attention in the media and counter-terrorism efforts when compared to possible attacks on civilian populations. However, in many countries, agricultural systems are one of the main economic sectors contributing to political stability, and the present literature lacks examples of terrorist attacks to agricultural systems. This paper {{is one of the first}} to discuss a concrete case of the appearance of a plant pathogen in an economically important region, possibly motivated by <b>agro-terrorism.</b> We highlight the differences between <b>agro-terrorism</b> and biocrime, and the causes and the consequences of the intentional introduction of pathogens as a means of causing economic damage. In particular, we argue that <b>agro-terrorism</b> and biocrime are both intentional criminal acts of introducing pathogens into agricultural systems to cause economic damage, but only <b>agro-terrorism</b> does so to advance a political agenda. Also, we argue that <b>agro-terrorism</b> can be difficult to distinguish from biocrime, and even if the intentional introduction of a pathogen is a political act of <b>agro-terrorism,</b> the consequences may or may not follow the desired script contemplated by the perpetrators, as pest outbreaks can entrain unintended economic, political and ecological consequences...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} a framework to value investment strategies to mitigate possible <b>agro-terrorism</b> occurrences in the food supply chain and to determine where these investments would reduce the most risk. This framework is applied to two food sectors that could be at risk: milk and green onions. Stochastic optimization is {{used to determine the}} costs and risk premiums of alternative tracking strategies. The real options method along with a portfolio of options, also referred to as the "tomato garden" framework, is used to determine where and when alternative intervention strategies should be implemented to reduce the most risk. Finally, policy implications are derived on the cost-risk tradeoffs, probability of attacks, and containment efforts if there is an attack by using game theory to determine the incentives needed to motivate participants in the milk and green onion supply chains to invest in security measures. <b>Agro-terrorism,</b> Stochastic optimization, Real options, Game theory, Milk, Green onions, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E

40|$|Concerns about {{biosecurity}} in {{the food}} system raise {{a variety of issues}} about how the system is presently organized, why it might be vulnerable, what one could reasonably do to better secure it, and the costs of doing so. After presenting some facts about US agriculture and food, this paper considers three economic aspects of the general problem. One is the global problem, or the way biosecurity measures can affect how countries relate to each other and the global consequences that result. Another is how to best manage the immediate aftermath of a realized threat in order to minimize damage. The third is how to seek to prevent realization of the threat. Some policy alternatives are also presented. <b>agro-terrorism,</b> animal disease, biosecurity, epidemic, food system policy. ...|$|E
40|$|Terrorism {{has been}} present {{in human history}} since ancient times, {{but it was not}} {{considered}} a serious threat for global security. The attacks on the World Trade Center have demonstrated that it is a threat of a global nature. It is an effective weapon used by the "weaker" against the stronger opponents. The subject of terrorism is very complex, difficult and elusive. There is a divergence among the scholars in understanding terrorism studies {{due to the lack of}} uniform criteria for the determination of a clear definition. Therefore, this article is an attempt to characterize the diversity of the terrorist activities that deviate from the “conventional” terrorism such as <b>agro-terrorism,</b> cyber-terrorism, super-terrorism, etc.). In addition, the paper stresses the need of combating terrorism as a partial solution to improve the safety of the international community. Mirosław Smolare...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} and identification of bacterial pathogens involved {{in acts of}} bio- and <b>agro-terrorism</b> are essential to avoid pathogen dispersal in the environment and propagation within the population. Conventional molecular methods, such as PCR amplification, DNA microarrays or shotgun sequencing, are subject to various limitations when assessing environmental samples, {{which can lead to}} inaccurate findings. We developed a hybridization capture strategy that uses a set of oligonucleotide probes to target and enrich biomarkers of interest in environmental samples. Here, we present Oligonucleotide Capture Probes for Pathogen Identification Database (OCaPPI-Db), an online capture probe database containing a set of 1, 685 oligonucleotide probes allowing for the {{detection and}} identification of 30 biothreat agents up to the species level. This probe set can be used in its entirety as a comprehensive diagnostic tool or can be restricted to a set of probes targeting a specific pathogen or virulence factor according to the user's needs...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Calvin Schwabe’s {{vision of}} “One Medicine ” has long {{inspired}} {{many in the}} public health community to strive toward bringing human and veterinary medicine together to improve the public’s health and well-being around the world. In an increasingly human-dominated world, as Dr. Schwabe suggested many years ago, human health provides the most-logical unifying or apical cause in veterinary medicine’s hierarchy of values. Veterinarians {{in all aspects of}} the profession—have opportunity and responsibility to protect {{the health and well-being of}} people in all that they do, including protecting food security and safety; addressing threats to antibiotic sensitivity; preventing and controlling zoonotic emerging infectious diseases; protecting environments and ecosystems; participating in bioand <b>agro-terrorism</b> preparedness and response; using their skills to confront non-zoonotic diseases (such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, vaccine preventable diseases, chronic diseases and injuries); strengthening the public-health infrastructure; and advancing medical science through research. This article provides an overview of contributions made by veterinarians in each of these areas, and discusses the challenges to be overcome and the need for strategic thinking and action to achieve the vision of “one medicine”...|$|E
40|$|US {{agricultural}} and companion animals are very {{vulnerable to the}} introduction of exotic and emerging animal diseases (EEAD). These diseases could occur through unintentional introduction (the risk of outbreaks grows as free trade increases), could occur through the deliberate introduction of disease agents (bio-terrorism or <b>agro-terrorism),</b> or could emerge as new diseases. EEAD, {{for the purpose of this}} course, are defined as those animal diseases that are reportable in the US. This includes diseases on the Office international des épizooties (OIE) List A, selected diseases on List B that either are not found in the US or are reportable, and selected emerging diseases. Some of the exotic and emerging diseases are considered to be foreign animal diseases because they do not occur in the US. Others are found in the US but are under eradication programs. Some are zoonotic and must be monitored and controlled to protect human health. Many of these diseases are important causes of animal suffering and are economically very important. It is essential that veterinarians be familiar with these diseases and have access to accurate, concise information about their salient characteristics...|$|E
40|$|EPFC (Emerging Patterns in Food Complaints) is the {{analytical}} {{component of the}} Consumer Complaint Monitoring System, designed to help the food safety officials to efficiently and effectively monitor incoming reports of adverse effects of food on its consumers. These reports, collected in a passive surveillance mode, contain multi-dimensional, heterogeneous and sparse snippets of specific information about the consumers ’ demographics, the kinds, brands and sources of the food involved, symptoms of possible sickness, characteristics of foreign objects {{which could have been}} found in food, involved locations and times of occurrences, etc. Statistical data mining component of the system empowers its users, allowing for increased accuracy, specificity and timeliness of detection of naturally occurring problems as well as of potential acts of <b>agro-terrorism.</b> The system’s main purpose is to enhance discovery and mitigation of food borne threats to public health in the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service regulated products. As such, it is being envisioned as one of the key components of the nationwide bio-security protection infrastructure.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedTo defend American agriculture against foreign or domestic terrorism, {{it is essential}} that states build multi-state partnerships to provide for the collaborative plans, programs and operations needed to protect the nations food security. The National Homeland Security Strategy puts states on the front lines {{in the war against terrorism}} [...] -including the struggle to secure the agriculture industry from potentially devastating attack. The issues surrounding <b>agro-terrorism</b> are vast and complex and the resources of the Federal government to address these issues are limited and overextended. If states attempt to address this threat independently, important opportunities to reduce vulnerability and enhance capability will be lost. To achieve the capabilities needed for agro terrorism detection, mitigation, preparedness and response, states must collaborate to build the partnerships and programs their citizens require. This thesis argues multi-state partnerships are critical to defeating this threat as well as providing a robust response to an attack. Whether intentionally introduced or naturally occurring, infectious diseases can easily cross state borders before an outbreak is even detected. States must be prepared to act quickly to mitigate the effects of any crisis. There is a significant opportunity for states to strengthen their abilities to provide for a stronger agriculture counter terrorism preparedness system. The states can further their ability to combat attacks on agriculture actively by demonstrating leadership in implementing administrative agreements and ultimately adopting compact(s) between states as well as with the private sector.

40|$|The September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks exposed vulnerabilities to U. S. {{homeland security and}} defense, leading U. S. officials to analyze threats to domestic and international interests. Terrorist attacks against food and water supplies (<b>agro-terrorism),</b> were deemed a national security threat because of the assessed fear, economic instability, and social instability that could occur following a food shortage. Research indicated a comprehensive response plan does not exist across the federal, state, and local levels of government to mitigate the public 2 ̆ 7 s possible responses to a perceived threat to food security and food shortages following an agro-terrorist attack. This ethnographic case study analyzed the perceived threats to food security and the possible responses to food shortages in Yuma, Arizona (the â??winter lettuce capitol of the worldâ??). Coleman and Putnam 2 ̆ 7 s theories of social capital served as the theoretical framework for this study. Data were collected through semistructured interviews of nine residents and six experts from Yuma 2 ̆ 7 s departments of government to examine the relative atmospherics between the citizens and government officials. Findings indicated that a comprehensive plan does not exist, and perceived fears {{and the lack of}} knowledge about emergency preparedness in a society with high social capital and community resilience can still create the conditions for chaos and anomie. Recommendations include improving communication, education, and expectation management of citizens. Implications for social change include improving public awareness and individual responsibility for preparedness, as well as assisting policymakers in maintaining social capital to deter social disorganization and anomie during disasters...|$|E
