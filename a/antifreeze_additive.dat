50|$|Automatic {{check valves}} are {{required}} to prevent back pressure. Regulations for these check valves specify the design capabilities of the valve used, according to the hazard. Category 2 contamination may be prevented by a single check valve, but category 3 requires a double check valve (these are manufactured as a convenient single unit, or even integrated into tap (faucet) fittings). Category 5 requires an air gap, not merely a valve. A recent introduction to the UK has been the Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) valve, a form of double check valve where the intervening zone is drained and normally kept empty. If the downstream valve leaks and permits backflow, this will drain out through the vent rather than building up pressure against the upstream valve. These valves are complex, requiring certified installation and annual checks. They are used for category 4 systems, such as fire sprinklers where the system has an <b>antifreeze</b> <b>additive.</b>|$|E
40|$|Usage of {{chemical}} additives while executing concrete works at negative temperatures is {{considered as a}} convenient and economical method. Range of the used antifreeze additives is rather wide. A great number of new additives are advertised but their characteristics have not been practically studied. Evaluation of the <b>antifreeze</b> <b>additive</b> efficiency is unfortunately rather long process {{and it does not}} provide comprehensive data on concrete structure formation processes. Due to this development of rapid and comprehensive methodology for construction companies is urgently required. Freezing processes of <b>antifreeze</b> <b>additive</b> aqueous solutions and hardening of cement paste with them have been investigated in the paper. The paper proposes a methodology for determination of freezing point for aqueous solutions {{of chemical}} additives of various applications. Identity of  freezing point for a chemical additive aqueous solution and cement paste with an equal concentration of the additive in the paste pore fluid has been determined while taking  calcium nitrate and sodium formate additives as an example. The paper demonstrates the possibility to evaluate efficiency of <b>antifreeze</b> <b>additive</b> action on the basis of kinetics in temperature changes of the cement paste with additives by its consecutive freezing and defrosting.   A methodology for operational evaluation in the field of chemical additive application for concreting items at negative temperatures has been offered in the paper.   The methodology does not require  deficient and expensive test-equipment. It can be applied at ordinary construction companies and it is comprehensible for personnel of low-qualification.   The paper shows the possibility to develop an original methodology for designing concrete structure which is based on operating efficiency determinations  for single and integrated antifreeze additives. </p...|$|E
40|$|The article {{covers the}} {{formation}} of the pore structure of cement systems that harden at low and negative temperatures. Temperature fluctuations that accompany the hydration of cement systems can produce a substantial impact onto the chemical activity of the water in the course of hydration. These factors can produce an adverse impact on {{the formation of}} the structure of the cement stone and impair its performance characteristics. The formation of the structure of cement systems is dependent on the impact of specialized <b>additives,</b> including <b>antifreeze</b> agents that facilitate hydration at low and negative temperatures. The research of their action and the nature of their influence on {{the formation of the}} microstructure of the cement stone facilitate the purposeful adjustment of their properties. Therefore, modification of cement systems by specialized antifreeze components is a relevant objective of scientific and practical research. Research of a classical cement system (a benchmark composition) and a cement system modified by a specialized <b>antifreeze</b> polymer-based <b>additive</b> (a modified composition) was performed to identify the impact of <b>antifreeze</b> <b>additives</b> onto the process of formation of its pore space. Upon completion of the research project described in the article, the authors have concluded that <b>antifreeze</b> <b>additives</b> facilitate hydration of cement at low and negative temperatures and cause regular formation of the pore structure of the cement stone.

40|$|Aims: Using {{a simple}} and {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method for the indirect determination of ethylene glycol by Malaprade reaction. The method {{was based on the}} extraction and preconcentration of iodine. Place and Duration of Study: Samples: Antifreeze samples were purchased from markets (Erbil, Kurdistan region, Iraq), between April 2011 and August 2011. Methodology: A method was developed for the determination of ethylene glycol (EG) in antifreeze samples. The method was based on the oxidation of EG with excess potassium periodate in slightly acidic medium; then, extraction and preconcentration of iodine was formed from the reaction of remained periodate with iodide. The decrease in the absorbance of extracted iodine is used to monitor the reaction spectrophotometrically at 515 nm. Results: The optimum reaction conditions and other analytical parameters were evaluated. Beer’s law is obeyed in the concentration range of 0. 2 – 10 μg/ml (R= 0. 9963) and 7. 0 – 36 μg/ml (R= 0. 9964) with detection limits of 0. 08 μg/ml. The effect of interfering species on the determination is described. Conclusion: Through the proposed method, a sensitive, low cost, selective, accurate and precise method has been described for the determination of ethylene glycol in antifreeze samples with no interferences from <b>antifreeze</b> <b>additives...</b>|$|R

An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments and also achieves boiling-point elevation ("anti-boil") to allow higher coolant temperature.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT Among the {{promising}} bulk chemicals, 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD) and 2, 3 -butanediol (2, 3 -BD) are two bio-based diols, {{which have a}} wide range of applications in cosmetic and food industry, as <b>antifreezes,</b> lubricants, fuel <b>additives,</b> {{as well as in the}} production of polymers. The possibility to obtain diols from the waste glycerol is topical by two reasons. First, the waste glycerol is received in large amounts during the manufacturing of biodiesel from plant oils and is inexpensive and renewable source. On the other hand, the glycerol's liberation in the environment is connected with serious ecological problems. In this study is reported the isolation of three novel strains G 9, G 31 and G 46, capable to convert glycerol into high amounts of 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD) and 2, 3 -butanediol (2, 3 -BD). They were examined by classical microbial tests and by the genetical approach of 16 S rDNA sequencing. The strains' physiological and biochemical features indicated their most possible affiliation to the species Klebsiella pneumoniae: they were facultative anaerobes, oxydase-negative and catalase-positive, did not grow at 10 ºC, didn't generate H 2 S and were able to ferment the all typical for the species carbohydrates. The sequencing of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene confirmed the affiliation of G 9, G 31 and G 46 to Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. The sequence comparison with the GenBank data (NCBI) showed 99 % sequence identity of G 31 with the type strain K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 T. G 9 and G 46 were closely related (99 % 16 S rDNA identical nucleotides) to another ATCC species: MGH 78578 and to the known as excellent glycerol fermenting strain K. pneumoniae TUAC 01. The other Klebsiella strains, known as glycerol consuming - K. oxytoca strain 17 and K. planticola strain DR 3 were quite phylogenetically distant from ours and formed a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree...|$|R
