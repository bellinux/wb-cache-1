Paracetamol had the flow properties and compactibility badly, it was necessary to make granules by wet granulation method (Voigt, 1984). This study aimed to determine the influence of variations in levels of arrowroot starch as a binder to the physical and chemical properties of paracetamol tablets. This research was conducted by mixing paracetamol with mucilago <b>amylum</b> arrowroot (FI: 5 %, FII: 7. 5 %, FIII: 10 %, FIV: 12. 5 %, and FV: 15 %) and were given lactose, sifted, and dried. Granules sifted back, plus primogel and magnesium stearate. Mixed granules tested flow rate, rupose angle and tapping index. The granules was then into tablet and then their physical properties were observed, including weight uniformity, hardness, brittleness, and dissolving time. The active substance content was decided based on Farmakope Indonesia Edisi III. The data gathered were then analyzed theoretically by comparing then against what were stated in the literature and statistic cally tested by using one way ANAVA with a confidence degree of 95 %, which was then furthered by using the Tuckey test. The result that the starch contained in the arrowroot could be used as a paracetamol tablet binder. Tablets of all formulas met the requirements of a good tablet physical properties. Hardness and tablet disintegration time increased with increasing levels of arrowroot starch as binder, while the fragility of the tablet decreased...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to observe}} the product XYZ holistically and assess the {{performance}} of current production processes in PT BCD, then solicit the best alternative to improve the production. There is {{a gap between the}} productions of XYZ with the potential demand in the market. Production of XYZ showed constant production in the last 5 years, while number of demand increased implicitly due to several factors. So the company needs alternative to increase the production. For solicit alternatives, this study used OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) method for analysis the production process. OEE is used in order to produce a comprehensive understanding of the process because it considers availability, performance, and quality aspects at once. The result of observation, OEE of heated drying machine is 78, 76 % and folding machine is 83, 76 %, lower than OEE World Class (85 %). That result makes this study focus to the both of machines. Alternative to improve the heated drying machine’s OEE is preventive action to prevent element wires of heater breaking, replace the blower when damage occurred, and specify the optimal temperature and time for drying process. While the alternative to improve the folding machine’s OEE is change the layout process and replace the person in charge of machine’s damage. Analysis of the yield improvement can increase production and profits PT BCD. Alternative to improve yield, include: facilitate the lifting of <b>amylum</b> while weighting process; improve the cleaning procedure on the process granulation, sieving, and drying; and reduce the suction power of vacum cleaner during tableting process. Directors need to assess the future strategy and sales forecast from marketing. If the implementation of OEE and improvement of yield are still not sufficient, it is necessary to choose other alternatives below gradually depending on the value of the desired output. Alternative to increased production from drying process is add employees work shift and a non heated drying cabinet; add a non heated drying cabinet and a heated drying cabinet; use Fluidized Bed Dryer (FBD). Alternative to the other process is add employess work shift or make employees overtime in tableting, stripping, folding catch cover, and sealing process or in the process of mounting the strip to catch cover...|$|E
