40|$|Noise {{measurements}} were obtained on models of jet-augmented lift systems which {{are currently being}} considered for use on proposed short takeoff and landing vehicles. These configurations included a conventional internally blown flap, an <b>augmenter</b> <b>wing,</b> an externally blown flap, and modifications of these basic concepts. The tests were conducted in the Langley anechoic noise facility at zero forward speed with cold air jets. The conventional internally blown flap exhibited lower noise levels than the <b>augmenter</b> <b>wing</b> and the externally blown flap {{at the same pressure}} ratios, being of the order of 8 dB or more at the lowest pressure ratio and of the order of 20 dB at the highest pressure ratio of the tests. The data also indicated that for the conventional internally blown flap, there may be an optimum gap size (other than zero) between the turning lip and the flap leading edge from the standpoint of minimum noise generation or admittance. Increasing the trailing-edge thickness of the plain internally blown flap produced no appreciable change in the overall sound pressure level or frequency spectral content in the range of the tests. The data indicated that at a position on the ground directly under the jet exit, the externally blown flap and the augmeter-wing overall noise levels are comparable to each other throughout the pressure range of the tests.

40|$|The {{interest}} in STOL airliners {{was reflected in}} the choice of a 100 - 118 passenger short range aircraft of this type as the 1971 design project. In addition {{to the use of the}} study for detailed investigation by the students of Aircraft Design it also served as the basis for an investigation of the low speed lift and control problems of STOL aircraft. This report is concerned with a description of the configuration adopted and specification of geometric and aerodynamic data. As such it is the first part of the complete reporting of the investigation, subsequent parts being concerned with the more detailed work. The aircraft was designed to operate from 2000 ft long single runways and have a cruising speed of up to 11 - 0. 83 at 30, 000 ft altitude. The estimated gross weight is 115, 000 lb and when landing at 100, 000 lb weight the approach speed is 79 knots. The high lift coefficients necessitated by this are obtained either by externally blown jet flaps or an <b>augmenter</b> <b>wing</b> arrangement...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} V/STOL thrust <b>augmenter</b> <b>wings</b> in flight at slow forward speeds is reported. Two rectangular planforms of differing relative chord lengths were tested. The augmenters were positioned in the aft {{portion of the}} wing to produce increases in circulation lift. Two blown flap configurations were tested for comparison. Surface pressures as well as total forces and moments were obtained on the semispan models at two flap deflections {{and a range of}} momentum coefficients. Tabulations of surveys at the pressure augmenter exit, downwash surveys downstream of the wing, and force and moment data are included...|$|R
