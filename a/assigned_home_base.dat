This was known as VQ-1 [...] "Det.B". The aircrew and ground support personnel were temporarily <b>assigned</b> from their <b>home</b> <b>base</b> at NAS Atsugi, Japan and after 1970, NAS Agana, Guam. After Det B was disestablished, VQ-1 provided detachments of two EA-3B aircraft that deployed with Western Pacific and Indian Ocean (WESTPAC/IO) bound aircraft carrier battle groups up until the late 1980s when it was replaced by the Lockheed ES-3A Shadow.|$|R
5000|$|From 30 January - April 1950: VP-47 {{deployed}} to NAB Saipan, with a detachment at NS Yokosuka, Japan, and NS Sangley Point, Philippines, coming under the operational control of FAW-1. The squadron participated in ASW exercises with British naval forces in March. Other ASW exercises {{were conducted in}} Japanese waters off Sasebo in conjunction with VP-28 during April. With {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War on 27 June, half of the squadron was still en route to the continental United States returning from deployment. The detachments were held up at Pearl Harbor; Guam; Sangley Point; and Yokosuka. All of the aircraft available were rerouted to Yokosuka to begin operations in the forward combat areas in Korea. By 7 July, the squadron’s detachments had rejoined and were relocated to NAF Iwakuni, Japan. Advance bases were set up for temporary operations at Inchon and Chinhae, Korea. The squadron began combat patrols of Tsushima Strait, mine reconnaissance around Inchon and Wonsan, ASP over the Sasebo to Busan shipping lanes, and general utility services by 31 July 1950. VP-47 was relieved on 1 January 1951 for return to the U.S., with the last aircraft arriving at NAS San Diego on 31 January 1951, almost twelve months to the day since it departed on what was anticipated as a six-month deployment.

Especially my father, Who guided me through my first {{experiment}} involving Rhizopus nigricans, And has sent me {{looking for answers}} ever since. iii The thesis examines the ability of animals to construct a <b>home</b> <b>base.</b> The <b>home</b> <b>base</b> is a point in space where animals rear, groom, and circle and is a primary element in organized spatial behaviour (Eilam and Golani 1989). Once animals establish a <b>home</b> <b>base,</b> they make outward trips and stops, and {{after a series of}} trips and stops they return again to the <b>home</b> <b>base.</b> The <b>home</b> <b>base</b> behaviour of animals acts as a platform for asking questions about the cognitive organization of an environment. The thesis describes five main findings. Control and hippocampectomized animals use (1) proximal and (2) distal cues to form a <b>home</b> <b>base</b> and organize their behaviour. (3) Control and olfactory bulbectomized animals form <b>home</b> <b>bases</b> in the dark where as hippocampectomized animals are impaired suggesting self-movement but not olfactory cues play a role in <b>home</b> <b>base</b> behaviour. A final set of experiments demonstrated that control and hippocampectomized animals learn the position of (4) proximal and (5) distal cues so that in the cue's absence, animals still form a <b>home</b> <b>base</b> at that position. The demonstration that a central feature of exploratory behaviour, establishing a <b>home</b> <b>base,</b> is preserved in hippocampectomized rats in relation to proximal, distal, and conditioned visual cues-reveals that exploratory behaviour remains organized after hippocampal lesions. The inability of hippocampectomized rats to form a virtual <b>home</b> <b>base</b> in the absence of visual cues is discussed in relation to the idea that the hippocampus contributes to inertial behaviour that may be dependent upon self-movement cues.

40|$|Abstract Background HIV/AIDS is fast {{becoming}} a chronic disease {{with the advent of}} antiretroviral drugs, therefore making <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care key in the management of chronically ill HIV/AIDS patient. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the perception and practice of health care workers on HIV/AIDS related <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care in the health facilities in Ogun state, Nigeria. Methods This study is an analytical cross-sectional study. A multistage cluster sampling technique was used to obtain a representative sample of the primary health care workers in Ogun state. An interviewer administered structured questionnaire was administered by trained health workers to elicit the required information. Result A total of 350 health care workers were interviewed, 70 % of the respondents could adequately describe the components of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care. Only 38. 7 % were aware of the National guideline on <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care practices and 17. 1 % believe that <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care will not significantly improve the prognosis of PLWAs. Few 19. 1 % had ever been trained or ever involved 16. 6 % in <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care practices. Only 20 [5. 7 %] are involved on a weekly basis, 16 [4. 6 %] monthly and 22 [6. 3 %] quarterly. Reasons given for non implementation of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care are inadequate number of healthcare workers 45 %, lack of political will 24. 4 %, lack of implementation by facility managers 14 % and inadequate funds 16. 6 %. Factors that were significantly associated with the practice of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care were perception of its relevance in improving prognosis [OR[*]=[*] 54. 21, C. I[*]=[*] 23. 22 - 129. 52] and presence of a support group in the facility [OR[*]=[*] 4. 80, C. I[*]=[*] 2. 40 - 9. 57]. There was however no statistically significant relationship between adequate knowledge of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care [OR[*]=[*] 0. 78, C. I[*]=[*] 0. 39 - 1. 54] and previous training on <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care (OR[*]=[*] 1. 43, C. I[*]=[*] 0. 66 - 3. 06]. Conclusion The practice of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care for HIV/AIDS among the study population is low and it is greatly influenced by perception of its effectiveness and relevance. The study recommends that the health care workers should be adequately educated on the importance of <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care in the management of chronic illnesses in order to enhance its practice. </p...|$|R

The aim of this research is to get insight into the position in the value chain of female <b>home</b> <b>based</b> workers in the context of Kathmandu and Hetauda, Nepal, and to analyze how organization affects the position in the value chain of these female <b>home</b> <b>based</b> workers and their livelihood as a whole. It is found that the female <b>home</b> <b>based</b> workers in this study are part of a captive value chain, in which the buyers hold the power and control and in which the female <b>home</b> <b>based</b> workers are highly vulnerable and powerless, as they are women with little marketing skills and knowledge, and highly dependent on the work. It is argued that organization not only helps the female <b>home</b> <b>based</b> workers directly through access to savings and credit, awareness trainings, and the development of friendships, but also to increase their competence in the value chain through skill improvement, market knowledge, and collective bargaining. It might even lead to a change in chain governance from a captive towards a relational one, in which there is more trust and mutual dependence between producer and buyer. Furthermore, it is argued that organization is essential for creating an enabling environment for the <b>home</b> <b>based</b> workers to live and work.

40|$|Magister Human Ecology - MHEIn many {{developing}} countries including South Africa, there is an overwhelming number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in the hospitals, which the health care workers are unable to cope with. Therefore, an urgent need to develop alternative community based activities such as support groups, <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care programs and placement of orphans, {{for the provision of}} social health care services to the HIV client, arises. However, {{a deeper understanding of the}} challenges facing community organizations when providing <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care is crucial and necessary in order to formulate effective and relevant care services. The aim of the study was to explore the challenges faced by Umtha elanga Community Organization (UWCO) in the provision of HIV/AIDS <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care. The objectives of the study were to assess the current <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care of the UWCO and to explore the challenges that community based organizations have to face when providing care services to people being infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. The research design undertaken was the case study of UWCO. The qualitative approach with in-depth interviews with the management staff and <b>home</b> <b>based</b> caregivers was utilized. Data analysis began immediately after the interviews by transcribing and translating the audio-taped data. Thematic analysis was used in which data was coded and categorized. The findings of the research indicated that the <b>home</b> <b>based</b> care programme assists PLWHA clients in their natural home setting. All <b>home</b> <b>based</b> carers work voluntary and get supported by the organization as ell as by the department of social development and health such as the social workers. Finances appear to be, both for the organization and the <b>home</b> <b>based</b> carers, a huge hindrance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{forms of}} spatial navigation, {{piloting}} using external cues and dead reckoning using self-movement cues, are {{manifest in the}} outward and homeward trips of adult rats exploring from a <b>home</b> <b>base.</b> Here, {{the development of these}} two forms of spatial behavior are described for rats aged 14 – 65 days using a new paradigm in which a huddle of pups or an artificial huddle, a small heat pad, served as a <b>home</b> <b>base</b> on an open circular table that the rats could explore. When moving away from both <b>home</b> <b>bases,</b> the travel distance, path complexity, and number of stops of outward trips from the <b>home</b> <b>base</b> increased progressively with age from postnatal day 16 through 22. When returning to the <b>home</b> <b>bases,</b> the return trips to the <b>home</b> <b>base</b> were always more direct and had high travel velocities even though travel distance increased with age for the longest trips. The results are discussed in relation to the ideas that: (1) the pups pilot on the outward portion of their excursion and dead reckon on the homeward portion of their excursion, and (2) the two forms of navigation and associated spatial capacity are interdependent and develop in parallel and in close association with locomotor skill...|$|R
