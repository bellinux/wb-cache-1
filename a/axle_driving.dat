5000|$|The outside, twin-cylinder, {{saturated}} steam engine was furnished with a Stephenson valve gear; the second <b>axle</b> was the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|No front leading <b>axle,</b> four <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> in a bogie, {{four more}} driven axles {{mounted in the}} frame (Mallet locomotive), {{superheated}} steam, four-cylinder machine, compound (double steam expansion), tank locomotive, for freight trains.|$|R

50|$|The mill was {{of three}} storeys, the base being of ragstone {{and the upper}} storeys of timber, clad in tarred weatherboarding. The {{overshot}} waterwheel was 14 ft diameter and 6 ft wide, mounted on a 9 in square iron <b>axle,</b> <b>driving</b> an iron pit wheel. The iron pentrough was dated 1887. The final remains of Mill Hall Mill were demolished {{to make way for}} the foundations of a footbridge over the M20.|$|E
50|$|This corn mill at Charing still stands, {{retaining}} {{a little}} machinery. The overshot waterwheel was 10 ft diameter and 5 ft wide. It bears the legend HILL & SON ASHFORD 1877. The waterwheel {{is carried on}} a 11 in cast-iron <b>axle,</b> <b>driving</b> a cast-iron Pit Wheel. All other machinery has been removed. The mill had two pairs of millstones. Millers were a Mr Pay and Mr Pope from 1878 - 1892, and Walter Hicks in 1892, having previously been at the windmill.|$|E
50|$|Front-wheel-drive layouts {{are those}} in which the front wheels of the vehicle are driven. The most popular layout used in cars today is the front-engine, front-wheel drive, with the engine {{in front of the}} front <b>axle,</b> <b>driving</b> the front wheels. This layout is {{typically}} chosen for its compact packaging; since the engine and driven wheels are {{on the same side of}} the vehicle, there is no need for a central tunnel through the passenger compartment to accommodate a prop-shaft between the engine and the driven wheels.|$|E
50|$|Bavaria's {{state-owned}} railway chose {{a different}} way: They also used P, S, or G {{to indicate the}} train type, but combined with the numbers of <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> and of the axles in total, separated by a slash (similar to the Swiss system). E. g., the famous S 3/6 was a 2'C1' or 4-6-2 Pacific, meaning that {{of a total of}} 6 <b>axles,</b> 3 were <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} steam locomotive, the crankshaft {{is one of}} the <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> In a jackshaft-driven steam locomotive, the crankshaft turns a jackshaft which, in turn, turns the driver. Some steam locomotives have had designs intermediate between these extremes, with crankshafts distinct from the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> Phineas Davis's first B&O Grasshopper tested on the B&O in 1831 was in this class, as was the Stockton and Darlington Railway's Swift from 1836, where the crankshaft was directly between the <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> [...] Both of these examples used vertical cylinders, with the crankshaft in the plane of the <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> The former used a geared drive to the first <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> the latter used side rods for this linkage. In the latter case, the reason inferred for using a crankshaft distinct from the driven axles was [...] "to take the shocks of working away from the power shaft." ...|$|R
50|$|The Renault PR180.2 was {{designed}} around {{an interesting and}} unusual concept. Most articulated buses only have one <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> - either the centre axle or the rear axle, however, the PR180.2 features two <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> - centre and rear.|$|R
50|$|The corn mill to {{the north}} of Hothfield still retains most of its machinery. It stood on a stream which feeds into the Great Stour. The {{cast-iron}} overshot waterwheel is 11 ft diameter and 7 ft wide, carried on a 7 in square cast-iron <b>axle,</b> <b>driving</b> a cast-iron Pit Wheel with 88 cogs. This drove a cast-iron wallower carried on a 6.5 in square cast-iron Upright Shaft, which also carried a 6 ft Great Spur Wheel which originally drove four pairs of millstones and latterly drove two pairs.|$|E
5000|$|After making several {{cars for}} their own use, the two founders {{launched}} the GN car in 1909, building them in the stables at the Frazer Nash family home. The car was powered by a V twin engine by JAP or Peugeot with belt drive to the rear wheels. By 1911, production had moved to Hendon and GN's own 1100 cc engine, using some Peugeot parts being fitted. The engine was mounted in the chassis with the crankshaft parallel to the front <b>axle,</b> <b>driving</b> through a two-speed transmission by chain and dog clutch, then by belt to the rear wheels. The two-seat car was very light, weighing only about 180 kg. Therefore, {{in spite of the}} low power available, 60 mi/h km/h was achievable, which was very respectable performance for the time.|$|E

50|$|A slow-running, large {{series-wound motor}} with 28 poles and two commutators drove the wheels, without any gear reduction, via an {{unsprung}} jackshaft. The jackshaft was linked by a coupling rod to three <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> {{housed in the}} locomotive frame. The axle base of the <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> was 2000 mm. The jackshaft was located {{between the first and}} second <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> The first and third <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were fixed to the frame, the centre one had transverse play to facilitate curve running. The mass was further distributed to two carrying axles that were designed as Adams axles. Control was achieved by means of a variable transformer (Drehtransformator) and power circuit breaker (Lastschalter) with 11 steps.|$|R
50|$|This design {{proved so}} {{effective}} on American railroads {{that many of}} the early 0-4-0s were rebuilt as 4-2-0s. The 4-2-0 excelled in its ability to stay on the track, especially those with the single <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> behind the firebox, whose main virtue was stability. However, with only one <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> behind the firebox, the locomotive's weight was spread over a small proportion of powered wheels, which substantially reduced its adhesive weight. On 4-2-0 locomotives which had the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> in front of the firebox, adhesive weight was increased. While this plan placed more of the locomotive's weight on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> it reduced the weight on the leading truck which made it more prone to derailments.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} driver's cab I {{a running}} axle bogie was mounted, while the other side got a single running <b>axle.</b> The four <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> are fixed, but the two in the middle can move {{sideways}} for better running characteristics in curves.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} surviving part of {{the mill}} is dated 1756, David Papillon being the then owner. The mill was extended c. 1890, when a steam engine was installed.

The cast-iron wallower has 32 teeth and is carried on a wooden upright shaft, driving a cast-iron Great Spur Wheel with 120 cogs. This drove three pairs of millstones. The stones are two pairs of 48 in Peak stones and one pair of 44 in French Burr stones by Hughes of Dover & London. The Crown Wheel is cast iron, with 18 teeth, it drove a total four layshafts which drove several machines, including a smutter and a Feltons Patent American Grist Mill.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is an old}} {{established}} corn mill site. The mill survives and retains most of its machinery. It has a {{cast iron}} overshot wheel driving three pairs of millstones.

5000|$|This mill {{was marked}} {{on a map}} of 1684, it was a paper mill at that time. In 1695 Edward Middleton was working the mill, which then had a {{rateable}} value of £20. He was at the mill until 1724 when William Harris took it over. William Harris died in 1741 and his widow ran the mill until 1744 when Thomas Harris took it over. He was still at the mill in 1763 when he insured the mill for £100. in 1776 Thomas Golding insured the mill. He was still at the mill in 1803 but by 1812 his son Stephen Golding was recorded as a master paper maker of Ditton when he married. There was a partnership between Thomas Golding and his sons Stephen and Thomas jr which was dissolved in 1816. The artist Jean Claude Natteas (1785-1822) sketched the mill in 1816. In 1832, Robert Tassell took over the mill and it ceased to make paper by 1841. In 1841, Stephen Spratt was recorded as the occupier of the mill, by then a corn mill. {{he was at the}} mill until at least 1862, the next change of ownership being recorded as Charles Stonham & Sons in 1878. A steam engine was recorded at the mill in 1887, but had gone by 1890, when Walter Skinner was the miller, still there in 1895. Henry Packham was the last miller, there at least 1905-13, but the mill had stopped working by 1922. The machinery was removed and the building converted into stables by A E Reed & Co. Ltd. the mill was demolished c.1950 but the waterwheel survived until 1969.The mill was of three storeys, the base being of ragstone and the upper storeys of timber, clad in tarred weatherboarding.

40|$|Abstract. Firstly, {{based on}} the {{theories}} and methods of acoustic intensity measurement, the surface radiation noise of the rear <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> of minibus was tested in the bench experiment. With {{the analysis of the}} experiment data, sound power was calculated to plot the noise distribution of the rear <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> It was found that the major noise source closed to the case of main reducer of the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> The major noise frequencies are related to the gear meshing vibration. These results basically coincide with the acoustic array experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{practical}} solution, first put into production by Norris, relocated the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> to a {{location on the}} frame {{in front of the}} locomotive's firebox. This was done because Baldwin refused to grant rights to Norris to use his patented [...] "half-crank" [...] arrangement. Cantilevering the weight of the firebox and the locomotive crew behind the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> placed more weight on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> without substantially reducing the weight on the leading truck. However, Norris's design led to a shorter wheelbase, which tended to offset any gains in tractive force on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> by reducing the locomotive's overall stability. A number of Norris locomotives were imported into England for use on the Birmingham and Bristol Railway since, because of the challenges presented by the Lickey Incline, British manufacturers declined to supply.|$|R
