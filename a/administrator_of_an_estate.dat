50|$|The <b>administrator</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>estate</b> is a {{legal term}} {{referring}} to a person appointed by a court to administer the estate of a deceased person who left no will.

Such a person {{is known as the}} administrator of the estate and will enjoy similar powers to those of an executor under a will. A female administrator may be referred to as an administratrix, although this sex-specific term is obsolete under modern presumptions about equality between sexes and may be considered insulting.|$|E

50|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, a {{personal}} representative or legal personal representative {{is a person}} appointed by a court to administer the estate of another person.

As a fiduciary, a personal representative has the duties of loyalty, candor or honesty, and good faith. In the United States, punctilio of honor, or the highest standard of honor, is the level <b>of</b> scrupulousness that <b>a</b> fiduciary must abide by.|$|R
