He {{was a member of}} several bodies dedicated to agriculture in Tasmania, including the responsible authority for the Royal Hobart Show. He was a pioneer in activities such as rabbit eradication and pasture improvement. He entered politics in 1921, standing as an independent in the Tasmanian Legislative Council, where he was <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> speaker. He retained his seat in the Tasmanian Parliament until his death following a gall bladder operation in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders of the}} National Reorganization Process, convicted in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, received presidential pardons, despite popular opposition to them. This was an old request of the Carapintadas in previous years. However, Menem did not apply their proposed changes to the military. The colonel, Mohamed Alí Seineldín, who was also pardoned, started a new mutiny, killing two military men. Unlike the mutinies that {{took place during the}} presidency of Alfonsín, the military fully obeyed Menem's orders for <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> repression. Seineldín was utterly defeated, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This was the last military mutiny in Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Winchelsey held various benefices in England, {{and was the}} Chancellor of Oxford University {{before being}} elected to Canterbury in early 1293. Although he {{initially}} {{had the support of}} Edward I, Winchelsey later became <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> opponent of the king. The archbishop was encouraged by the papacy to resist Edward's attempts to tax the clergy. Winchelsey was also an opponent of the king's treasurer Walter Langton as well as other clergy. On one occasion he rebuked an abbot so sternly that the abbot suffered a fatal heart attack.|$|E

Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt of the allied forces would not to let pride and vanity be {{the downfall of the}} attack and pleaded with Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry was no match for the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man. The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|On 14–19 December 1970 mass demonstrations {{against the}} price rises {{broke out in}} the {{northern}} coastal cities of Gdańsk, Gdynia, Elbląg and Szczecin. In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including the party headquarters in Gdańsk and Szczecin. The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomułka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property. Nevertheless, Gomułka remained determined to impose <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> resolution of the conflict. Among the leaders of the party who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gdańsk, were Zenon Kliszko and Stanisław Kociołek. In Gdynia, the soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. The exact number of people killed in the region in December is not known, but is believed to be higher than the officially given figure of 44.|$|E

5|$|The 173d Airborne Brigade {{was made}} part of Task Force Viking, a special {{operations}} {{task force that}} contained elements of the 10th Mountain Division and the 10th Special Forces Group. The use of the 173d {{as a part of}} a special operations task force was a unique first in U.S. Army history. This force was assisted by Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq and tasked with attacking key airfield and oil production positions deep in northern Iraq. The brigade would take off from Aviano Air Base in Italy, a 4½-hour flight from northern Iraq. As the preparations for the brigade were in their final stages, it moved 10 trains and 300 trucks worth of equipment to the air base, as well as 120 busloads of soldiers. Though the brigade's movement was impeded by Italian protestors, the Italian police provided escort operations to the brigade and ensured that it reached the Air Base without incident, and was not significantly delayed. Operation Iraqi Freedom began on 20 March with V Corps, consisting of the 101st Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, and 3d Infantry Division making <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> push from the south, beginning the Iraq War. A few days later, the 173d and 10th Special Forces Group departed for northern Iraq.|$|E
5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with <b>a</b> <b>forceful</b> blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E
