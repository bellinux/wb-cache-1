5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

25|$|Folklore {{is one of}} {{the central}} subject in the poetry of Naidu. In The Bazaars of Hyderabad is {{associated}} with one such subject, the charm and enthusiasm of a traditional Indian bazaar in the city of Hyderabad is presented in this poem. Naidu had enthusiastically described the Bazaar with merchants and vendors selling diverse range of wares. The poet stops over at the galleries arranged by the merchants, traders, hawkers, goldsmiths, fruit sellers, peddlers,magicians,musicians and flower girls. The poet describes the experience of conversation between the seller and the buyer, here the poet questions the sellers <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> selling and who in turn politely answer while explaining their products. Emotional moods are stirred by the poet, when Naidu makes the readers feel that the bazaar life also witnesses both sorrows and joys. Wedding and festival occasions brings joy in the Bazaar’s life when people buy jewellery, garlands, fruits and children crowding near the magicians. The sorrow and sadness is witnessed when common public kitchens are arranged when the nobles or soldiers die and when flower girls are seen weaving masses of white flowers to be used for the dead people’s grave.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2010, Duncan Smith {{studied a}} state-sponsored {{relationship}} education programme in Norway, under which couples {{were forced to}} [...] "think again" [...] and confront the reality of divorce before formally separating. The policy has been credited with reversing Norway’s trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to £100billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to [...] "work through {{what is going to}} happen with their children", which has [...] "a very big effect on their thinking".

She told The New York Times that after the fall of the Soviet Union, many new young journalists were hired, resulting in a much younger pool of staffers than other news organizations. Journalist Danny Schechter (who has appeared as a guest on RT) has stated that having been part of the launch staff at CNN, he saw RT as another [...] "channel of young people who are inexperienced, but very enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing."

2500|$|Rather he {{uses the}} logic of {{hermeneutic}} tradition (from interpretative sociology) to argue {{for the importance of}} agency in sociological theory, claiming that human social actors are always to some degree knowledgeable <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing. Social order is therefore a result of some pre-planned social actions, not automatic evolutionary response. Sociologists, unlike natural scientists, have to interpret a social world which is already interpreted by the actors that inhabit it. According to Giddens there is a [...] "Duality of structure" [...] by which social practice, which is the principal unit of investigation, has both a structural and an agency-component. [...] The structural environment constrains individual behaviour, but also makes it possible. He also noted the existence of a specific form of a social cycle: once sociological concepts are formed, they filter back into everyday world and change the way people think. Because social actors are reflexive and monitor the ongoing flow of activities and structural conditions, they adapt their actions to their evolving understandings. As a result, social scientific knowledge of society will actually change human activities. Giddens calls this two-tiered, interpretive and dialectical relationship between social scientific knowledge and human practices the [...] "double hermeneutic".|$|E
