40|$|Background: Physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} as a potential strategy for improving social and emotional well-being in at-risk youth, who have a prevalence of depression and low self-esteem exceeding the general population. Methods: A systematic search of six electronic databases (EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus and SPORTDiscus) was conducted to identify physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> designed to improve social and emotional well-being in at-risk youth. Results: The search identified 15 studies, which reported the effects of three types of physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> (i. e. outdoor adventure, sport and skill-based and physical fitness programmes) on social and emotional well-being. While many of the interventions resulted in significant positive effects, the risk of bias was high in all of the included studies. Conclusion: Due to the mixed findings and the high risk of bias, {{it is difficult to determine}} the efficacy of physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> for improving social and emotional well being in at-risk youth...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Adherence to {{behavioural}} intervention programmes is {{a necessary}} condition for beneficial outcomes to be achieved. This study tested whether social cognitive variables and coping plans predict adherence. Design and methods. Adherence was examined in a randomized controlled trial with healthy older women (age range: 70 - 93 years), who were randomized to a physical (N= 86) or a mental (N= 85) activity intervention. Intentions, self-efficacies, coping plans, and objectively measured adherence levels were assessed. A moderated mediation analysis evaluated the power of coping plans to translate intention into behaviour, depending on levels of prior adherence. Results. Adherence to the physical <b>activity</b> <b>programme</b> (65 %) was significantly lower than adherence to the mental <b>activity</b> <b>programme</b> (84 %, p <. 001). Intentions (beta=. 22) weakly predicted adherence in the initiation period of the physical <b>activity</b> <b>programme</b> (6 weeks); pre-action self-efficacy predicted adherence in the initiation period of the mental <b>activity</b> <b>programme</b> (beta=. 35). In both groups, coping plans predicted mid-period adherence (10 weeks) and long-term adherence (20 weeks), moderated by prior adherence (all ps <. 01). Coping plans mediated the relationship between intentions and behaviour only in the exercise condition. Conclusions. Instructing older individuals to generate coping plans facilitated their adherence to physical and mental <b>activity</b> <b>programmes.</b> This effect was larger for participants with lower levels of prior adherence - and may have prevented them from dropping out of the programme...|$|R

40|$|Mapping {{exercise}} referral schemes in Lancashire Background: Physical {{activity is}} a key action point for {{the growing number of}} organisations interested in promoting public health. The increase in physical activity promotion is welcome but difficult to monitor. Whilst specific organisations such as Sport England have developed databases on sports clubs and sports programmes linked to their mission statement, there is fragmented and patchy evidence on physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes.</b> This {{is a result of the}} lack of a systematic approach to gathering data on “health related ” physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes.</b> In response a number of regions have commissioned audits and/or surveys of physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes.</b> Recently in 2006, in order to obtain a picture of health related physical activity in the 42 primary care trusts and 45 local authorities of North West region (6. 7 millio...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{can have a}} positive impact on cognition and well-being in older people. This article reviews and evaluates the effects of planned physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> on mood, sleep and functional ability in people with dementia. A total of 27 studies between 1974 and 2005 were found. Of these, four included participants living at home, two involved participants who were living either at home or in care homes and 21 included participants living solely in care homes. Since psychosocial intervention can reduce family caregiver burden, the break down of home-care and associated rates of institutionalization, the indirect effects of these physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> on the family caregiver are also explored. The scope for developing physical <b>activity</b> <b>programmes</b> for people with dementia in primary care using families and volunteers is discussed. © 2006, Sage Publications.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of overweight and obesity in primary school children in Glasgow and to evaluate a pilot <b>activity</b> <b>programme</b> for overweight and obese children. BMI was measured in 1548 children. Overweight, obesity and severe obesity were defined as BMI $ 85 th, 95 th and 98 th centile, respectively. Overweight and obese children were then invited to participate in a 10 -week school-based <b>activity</b> <b>programme.</b> The programme was evaluated by recording weekly attendance, intensity (using the Children's Effort Rating Scale) and enjoyment (scale 1 - 10). Focus groups were used to explore the experiences and views of the children, teachers, coaches and parents. Of the 1548 children, 31 · 4 % were overweight, 19 · 1 % were obese and 12 · 4 % were severely obese; 38 % of those invited attended the <b>activity</b> <b>programme.</b> Weekly programme attendance was 83 % (range 56 - 99 %). Mean enjoyment rating (scale 1 - 10) was 8 for boys and 9 for girls. The intensity of activity sessions were rated 'very easy' by boys and 'just feeling a strain' by girls. Common themes emerging from the focus groups related to perceived positive and negative aspects of the programme (fun, concerns about stigmatising children); physical and psychological outcomes (fitter, more confident); and future recommendations (involve parents). In summary, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was high. The <b>activity</b> <b>programme</b> was successful in terms of attendance and enjoyment, and overall views of the initiative were positive and there was compelling support for its continuation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Exercise {{programmes}} {{have important}} role in prevention of falls, but to date, we have little knowledge {{about the effects of}} Adapted Physical <b>Activity</b> <b>programme</b> on balance of older women. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of an Adapted Physical <b>Activity</b> <b>programme</b> on balance, risk of falls and quality of life in community-dwelling older women. Design. This was a randomized controlled study. Setting: Community, in a local sport centre. Population: Older women aged over 60 years. Methods: Seventy-six women were randomised to an exercise group providing Adapted Physical <b>Activity</b> <b>programme</b> for 25 weeks or a control group (in which they did not participate in any exercise programme). The one-leg stance test, Timed Up and Go test, incidence of fall and the quality of life (SF- 36 V 2) were measured at baseline and after 25 weeks. Results: The one-leg stance test and the Timed Up and Go test in the exercise group was significantly better than in the control group after the intervention period (P= 0. 005; P= 0. 001, respectively). The Physical Functioning, Vitality and General Health subdomains of quality of life were also significantly better in the exercise group compared to the control group (P= 0. 004; P= 0. 005; P= 0. 038, respectively). Relative risk was 0. 40 (90 % CI 0. 174 to 0. 920) and the number needed to treat was 5 (95 % CI 2. 3 to 23. 3). Conclusion: This 25 -week Adapted Physical <b>Activity</b> <b>programme</b> improves static balance, functional mobility, as well as Physical Functioning, Vitality and General Health subdomains of quality of life. Clinical Rehabilitation Impact: Based on our results, the Adapted Physical <b>Activity</b> <b>programme</b> may be a promising fall prevention exercise programme improving static balance and functional mobility for community-dwelling older women...|$|R
