40|$|The {{vacuum system}} for a {{proposed}} 2. 5 GeV, 10 {Mu}A recirculating linac synchrotron light source [1] is readily achievable with conventional vacuum hardware and established fabrication processes. Some of the difficult technical challenges associated with synchrotron light source storage rings are sidestepped by the relatively low beam current and short beam lifetime requirements of a re-circulating linac. This minimal lifetime requirement leads directly to relatively high limits on the background gas pressure {{through much of the}} facility. The 10 {Mu}A average beam current produces very little synchrotron radiation induced gas desorption and thus the need for an ante-chamber in the vacuum chamber is eliminated. In the <b>arc</b> <b>bend</b> <b>magnets,</b> and the insertion devices, the vacuum chamber dimensions can be selected to balance the coherent synchrotron radiation and resistive wall wakefield effects, while maintaining the modest limits on the gas pressure and minimal outgassing...|$|R

The design bending {{power for the}} primary <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> for the spectrometer will have an induction bend radius product of 2. 5 tesla-meters. In order to increase {{the acceptance of the}} spectrometer, the <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> system must be located close to the target where the desired nuclei are created. The spectrometer magnet system must consist of both bending and focusing elements so that the wide acceptance of particles can be brought to a focus at the analysis point that is down stream from the last magnet element. In order improve the spectrometer resolution and to catch the shortest lived nuclei, the length of the magnet system must be as short as possible. The length for the LASSY spectrometer magnet system from the target to the analysis point has been set at 2. 5 meters or less. To improve the resolution of the spectrometer, the bending angle for <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> system must be increased to close to 180 degrees. In order to achieve a large bending angle and a short magnet system length, the bending induction must be above 3 tesla and the focusing elements must be combined with the bending elements.

In this paper we consider standard wigglers i. e. wigglers in which interference effects on the spectrum of synchrotron radiation are not important. In standard wigglers the spectrum of synchrotron radiation has the same general shape as the spectrum from ring <b>bending</b> <b>magnets.</b> How-ever, the critical energy of the wiggler spectrum may be different. The critical energy of the wiggler spectrum is given by BW kw = 'CB T where ECB is the critical energy from the <b>bending</b> <b>magnets</b> and BWandBB are the magnetic field strengths of the wiggler <b>magnet</b> and <b>bending</b> <b>magnets</b> respectively.
