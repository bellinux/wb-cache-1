25|$|In {{studying}} <b>adolescent</b> <b>development,</b> adolescence can {{be defined}} biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes {{in the ability to}} think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles. Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. Cognitive advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of <b>adolescent</b> <b>development</b> often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions. Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status. Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, and argue that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not inherent.|$|E
25|$|School {{psychology}} {{is a field}} that applies principles of educational psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, community psychology, and applied behavior analysis to meet children's and adolescents' behavioral health and learning needs in a collaborative manner with educators and parents. School psychologists are educated in psychology, child and <b>adolescent</b> <b>development,</b> child and adolescent psychopathology, education, family and parenting practices, learning theories, and personality theories. They are knowledgeable about effective instruction and effective schools. They are trained to carry out psychological testing and psychoeducational assessment, counseling, and consultation, and in the ethical, legal and administrative codes of their profession.|$|E
25|$|Jean Macfarlane {{founded the}} University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, {{formerly}} called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute {{was instrumental in}} initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development {{of children in the}} Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of <b>adolescent</b> <b>development.</b> Elder formulated several descriptive principles of <b>adolescent</b> <b>development.</b> The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our newly constructed Constraining and Enabling Coding System (CECS). This scheme was constructed to identify family interactions that are conceptually relevant to <b>adolescent</b> ego <b>development.</b> First, {{we discuss the}} theoretical rationale and reliability properties of the codes. We then present results of applying the scales to observations of 61 families, consisting of 2 parents and an adolescent, drawn from matched high school and psychiatric populations. All families are upper and (predominantly) upper-middle class. Each member completed the Loevinger Sentence Completion Test and then participated in a revealed-differences task, using responses to Kohlberg Moral Dilemmas as discussion stimuli. Transcripts of these audiorecorded discussions formed the data base for the family analyses. After controlling for patient status and adolescent age, adolescent and parent ego-development scores still contributed to explained variance in family interactions. <b>Adolescent</b> ego <b>development</b> was positively associated with adolescent enabling behaviors (e. g., problem solving, empathy). In contrast, there were negative correlations between constraining behaviors (e. g., devaluing, withholding) and <b>adolescent</b> ego <b>development.</b> Parental behaviors {{were significantly associated with}} (a) parent ego <b>development,</b> and (b) <b>adolescent</b> ego <b>development.</b> The third dimension of our system, discourse change, also showed theoretically expected strong correlations between progressive discourse change and ego development.

2500|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{called the}} teen timetable {{has been used}} to measure the age at which individuals believe adolescents should be able to engage in behaviors associated with autonomy. This questionnaire {{has been used to}} gauge differences in cultural perceptions of adolescent autonomy, finding, for instance, that White parents and adolescents tend to expect autonomy earlier than those of Asian descent. [...] It is, therefore, clear that cultural differences exist in perceptions of adolescent autonomy, and such differences have implications for the lifestyles and development of adolescents. In sub-Saharan African youth, the notions of individuality and freedom may not be useful in understanding <b>adolescent</b> <b>development.</b> Rather, African notions of childhood and <b>adolescent</b> <b>development</b> are relational and interdependent.|$|E

Derived from the Latin puberatum (age of maturity), the word puberty describes the physical changes to sexual maturation, not the psychosocial and cultural maturation denoted by the term <b>adolescent</b> <b>development</b> in Western culture, wherein adolescence is the period of mental transition from childhood to adulthood, which overlaps much of the body's period of puberty.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{challenges}} of being a third culture individual is developing a sense of belonging, commitment, and attachment to a culture. These factors play a strong role in one's self-esteem and identity, and are especially apparent as present or not present among TCKs. There are psychological benefits to being a bi-culturally competent individual, meaning that adjustment to the host culture and repatriation do not pose a difficulty for the individual. Individuals who do not experience this same smooth transition into the new culture {{are referred to as}} [...] "culturally rootless" [...] and [...] "cultural homelessness". Culturally homeless (CH) individuals often experience confusion over their identity and especially because the TCK is frequently abroad during the <b>adolescent</b> <b>development</b> years when identity is most solidified psychologically.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developmental}} feminist {{perspective is}} {{closely tied to}} the social constructionist perspective. It is specifically interested in how society's gender norms affect <b>adolescent</b> <b>development,</b> especially for girls. For example, some researchers on the topic hold the view that adolescent girls are still strongly affected by gender roles imposed on them by society and that this in turn affects their sexuality and sexual behavior. Deborah Tolman is an advocate for this viewpoint and states that societal pressures to be [...] "good" [...] cause girls {{to pay more attention to}} what they think others expect of them than looking within themselves to understand their own sexuality. Tolman states that young girls learn to objectify their own bodies and end up thinking of themselves as objects of desire. This causes them to often see their own bodies as others see it, which causes them to feel a sense of detachment from their bodies and their sexualities. Tolman calls this a process of disembodiment. This process leaves young girls unassertive about their own sexual desires and needs because they focus so much on what other people expect of them rather than on what they feel inside.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} of <b>adolescent</b> <b>development</b> {{that are more}} rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures. Culture {{has been defined as}} the [...] "symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued". [...] Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life. [...] Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a youth culture. [...] For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture. However, [...] "culture" [...] should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, to avoid ethnocentrism, researchers must be careful not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} examining materialism and adolescence has often focused on investigating {{the relationship between}} material-ism and the adolescent’s personality traits and consumption pat-terns (Achenreiner 1997; Goldberg et al. 2003). Further, research-ers found that, from a developmental perspective, parental values are the primary means of socializing adolescents to specific values (Kilby 1993). For example, adolescents that value material posses-sions more than they value self-acceptance, affiliation, or commu-nity feelings are associated with more materialistic and less sup-portive parents (Kasser, Ryan and Zax 1995). In this study, we aim to build on this line of research by exploring historical/environmen-tal factors that could influence the <b>adolescent’s</b> <b>development</b> of materialist value.
