5|$|Although <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{horse is}} not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that <b>a</b> <b>large</b> horse was desirable to increase the power of a lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E
50|$|Bangladesh and South Korea {{are larger}} and more densely {{populated}} (hence have <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> population), and only Taiwan is smaller and has <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> population (hence <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> population density). There are 21 more countries (12 independent ones and 9 dependent territories) with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> population density, but they all have a smaller population (hence a smaller area). If the water area is not counted then Taiwan is larger, and there are 16 more countries (9 independent ones and 7 dependent territories) with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> population density.|$|R

5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was <b>a</b> <b>large</b> eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is larger than the}} molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E
5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building a small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E

5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of immigrants from Romania, followed by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of walkers, who use <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
