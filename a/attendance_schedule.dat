40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} two {{empirical studies}} of the Lidcombe Program of early stuttering intervention. A retrospective file audit of the Lidcombe Program was performed in North America in order to evaluate the relationship between specific case variables and treatment time during Stage 1 (instatement of fluency). The study was a replication and extension of the file audit study by Jones et al. (2000), with the time between clinic visits being considered as an additional variable. The variables were extracted from files of 138 children younger than 6 years who had completed Stage 1 of the treatment. The {{results showed that the}} median number of clinic visits to complete Stage 1 was 11. High pre-treatment stuttering severity predicted more clinic visits. Mean interval between clinic visits of fewer than 11 days was associated with longer treatment times than mean interval of 11 days or more. The results for North America were generally consistent with benchmark data from the United Kingdom and Australia. The data from previous Australian and British studies were combined with the North American data and a meta-analysis was performed to establish worldwide clinical benchmarks. This study indicated the potential clinical significance of <b>attendance</b> <b>schedule</b> and prompted further investigation. A Phase II prospective clinical trial of different treatment schedules for the Lidcombe Program was conducted to evaluate the effects of treatment schedules during Stage 1 clinic visits, with reference to treatment efficiency and efficacy. Twenty-one children were randomly allocated into one of three Lidcombe Program treatment schedules: attendance weekly, twice weekly, or fortnightly. It was found that the median number of clinic visits to complete Stage 1 by treatment schedule was 23 for weekly attendance, 27 for twice weekly attendance and 10 for fortnightly attendance. The findings suggest that fortnightly attendance was efficient and efficacious for the children in this study. The implications for an alternative service delivery model with the Lidcombe Program are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of EQUAL project "FAMILY UNIVERSE: Family-Friendly Organization" was {{to create}} and to test {{innovative}} methodology and means for educational institutions and organizations, starting to reconcile family and professional life and trying to change stereotypical gender roles {{in the family and}} in the work, by forming family-friendly study and work environment in Siauliai University. Conditions for the establishment of family oriented organization at University of Šiauliai are analysed in this article. The terms "family-friendly workplace," "family-friendly company," and "family-friendly employer" refer to a workplace that, to some extent, acknowledges and responds to the work and personal / family responsibilities assumed by employees. Strachan and Burgess (1998, p. 251) note, "… (a) 'family friendly workplace' is one which … develops and implements policies that allow employees to simultaneously fulfill work and family responsibilities. " The concept of a family-friendly workplace is usually conceptualized as a continuum, rather than a dichotomous variable. Work-family leaders have identified four interrelated components to family-friendly workplaces: benefits, policies and programs that promote employees' quality of life and work/life balance; workplace cultures and climates that reflect "family" or employee-centered assumptions and beliefs; workplace relationships (e. g., with supervisors and coworkers) that are respectful of employees' work-family and work/life responsibilities; and work processes, systems, and structures/practices that keep the dual agenda (e. g., beneficial outcomes both for the organization and for employees) in the forefront. The concept of the project entitled “Family Planet: Family-Friendly Organization” also centers around gender equality issues; the project is aimed at creating conditions and testing measures for employees and students to reconcile family, work and studies and at changing stereotype views and attitudes toward male and female roles: 1) a balance of genders was sought in selecting representatives of the DP partners for the implementation of the project: men constitute 30 %; 2) reduction of horizontal segregation is sought by employing men in “female” spheres and women in “male” spheres: at the child care centre, there is one man among 4 workers, while at the distant learning class there is one woman out of 2 workers; 3) use of innovative measures to reconcile work, studies and family is being recorded (by gender); 4) measurements and monitoring of gender inequality are being conducted in order to evaluate the gender situation by branches of science, faculties and centres, the distribution of financial flows, annual “Best Teacher” and “Best Scientist” awards etc.; 4) four instruments for the monitoring of gender equality/inequality have been developed: they measure equal/unequal access and opportunities; academic and research participation / lack of participation, outcome lack of outcome and equality/inequality in working / studying conditions; 5) measures to increase workers and students, men‘s and women‘s awareness of equal opportunities are developed and tested, such as training, interactive surveys and voting by expressing personal position; presentation of interesting measures that are applied by advanced organisations at the project’s website; publication of examples of sexist language; 6) identified different needs, expectations, experience and behaviour of men and women, facts of discrimination and non-recognition, manifestations of inequality between superiors and subordinates, students and teachers in male and female organizations. Examination of the global university education environments favor students for employment and family responsibilities and the realization of summarizing the study results lead to the following conclusions: 1. The majority of students are generally have positive attitude of the family and educational measures to improve the organization concerned. The majority of students (85 %) believe that the university authorities should introduce measures to facilitate the students to combine study and family concerns. 2. Attractive study and work coordination means are teaching students working in respect of goodwill, free <b>attendance</b> <b>schedule</b> and individual study opportunities; in general studies and the harmonization of work as a package of acute and graduate students studying by correspondence. 3. Excellence study and family reconciliation measures are related to the favorable attitude of teachers in raising children and students need a financial incentive measures (scholarships, reduced fees, assistance fund) ...|$|E

Four standardized tests were also administered. 'Results demonstrated a drop in recall between the 1 -day and the 2 -day groups in all aspects investigated. The 5 -day group performed better-than the 2 -day group on initial recall of lesson components, but not on recall of lesson component details (with the exception of recall of a story). Three of the four standardized tests were found to correlate with children's recall ability.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 35 - 37). Cancer has continuously {{been the}} 2 nd {{leading cause of}} death in the United States and is also the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite the prodigious amount of research on new types of cancer, risk factors, and causalities, cancer still exists today and affects many people's lives. No-show is a behavior of failing to keep scheduled appointment and is commonly seen in many hospital settings such as primary care and mental health, including among the chemotherapy patients at Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego (MCC UCSD) too. When patients fail to cancel scheduled appointments, it affects both the hospital and patient, especially among cancer patients. When they fail to attend scheduled appointments, it can delay better health outcomes and can lower survival rates. No-show behavior is not a commonly studied topic with cancer, so research in this area is still sparse and in the process of growing. In an effort to further expand knowledge of no-show behavior, this study aimed to analyze demographic and clinical characteristics of MCC UCSD's chemotherapy patient's appointments to determine the factors that result a failure to attend scheduled appointments. With a cross-sectional design approach, the study analyzed evidence-based covariates, age, gender, marital status, cancer type, and distance to treatment center, along with other variables, ethnicity, race, payor method, and provided service. The primary outcome of this study was patient <b>attendance</b> at <b>scheduled</b> appointments, defined as no-show (a missed scheduled appointment in the past fiscal year) or show (a scheduled appointment in the past fiscal year that was kept). As hypothesized, driving distance to MCC UCSD was associated with <b>attendance</b> at <b>scheduled</b> appointments (p<. 0001) when adjusted for age, gender, race, marital status, payor method, type of service, cancer type, and the interactions of driving distance with gender, race, payor method, and cancer type.

In Study 2, the rela-tionships between developmental progress and the length of the school day and the amount of related services received per week were investigated on 66 participants. Children in full-day classrooms had greater developmental delays but achieved higher rates of progress than their half-day peers in the areas of social and emotional devel-opment and overall development. The practice of integrating preschool children with dis-abilities into programs with their typically developing peers is well established. Children with disabilities have been included in Head Start, public school prekinder-gartens, and community-based programs (Odom et al., 1999; Wolery et al., 1993).

The MLP uses wireless communications (Bluetooth, WI-FI, WIMAX) {{to connect with the}} Moodle server. Later, after the connection is established with the server, the J 2 ME application will be able to provide the user with a bundle of services. These services include grades, course <b>schedules,</b> <b>attendance</b> records, course announcements, and university activities, as well as quality assessments...|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that attendance at lectures and tutorials {{is associated with}} university students’ level of success and satisfaction, and pre-service teachers’ relatively low levels of <b>attendance</b> at <b>scheduled</b> classes is of significant concern to many lecturers. However, {{little research has been}} undertaken to investigate the factors associated with absenteeism among pre-service teachers. This study investigates rates of absenteeism among different groups of pre-service teachers in a large School of Education in a Western Australian university and considers pre-service teachers’ self-reported reasons for being absent from lectures and tutorials. The results show that levels of attendance and reasons for absence at lectures vary according to demographic factors such as age, paid employment, entry pathway, course, mode of study and year level of study. Level of attendance at tutorials is affected by the same factors, except that the year of study (first, second, third or fourth) {{does not appear to be}} an influence. The relationships between attendance and achievement are also interrogated...|$|R
40|$|Commercialization {{of sport}} {{has been growing}} since 80 s and club owners tend to pay more and more {{attention}} not just to cups and titles but to commercial success as well. Nevertheless, fans are still the key source of revenues. Besides direct spending while attending games popular clubs and crowded stadiums grab attention of generous advertisers. That is why the problem of sports attendance {{becomes more and more}} important though ice hockey attendance is still not the most popular topic among sports marketing researchers. The majority of them cover Canada and the United States while European leagues suffer from the lack of studies as much bigger attention is paid to sport number one – soccer. In the same time, Sweden {{is one of the few}} countries in the world where ice hockey might be as popular as soccer. Swedish ice hockey league is one of the strongest in the world but still many clubs fail to sell out their arenas at every game. So the main purpose of this research is to identify factors that influence attendance of ice hockey games in Sweden and reveal their impact on attendance. The analysis is conducted using quantitative methods, where econometrical and statistical approaches are primary tools. In order to test factors influencing attendance a multiple regression model was set up. The dataset was compiled using secondary data and consisted of 1317 regular season ice hockey matches played during 4 seasons (from 2008 / 2009 to 2011 / 2012) of the top Swedish ice hockey league called Elitserien. The main sources for compiling the dataset were game reports provided by Swedish Ice Hockey Association and Elitserien. The present study has shown that several factors have strongly positive effect on <b>attendance.</b> <b>Scheduling</b> (games on Friday, Saturday and during Christmas holidays) and rivalry are the most important factors that bring crowds to arenas. Moreover, it can be concluded that higher prices do not affect attendance negatively and clubs can slightly increase ticket prices to improve match day revenues. Finally, on-ice violence attracts Swedish fans while opposite trend exists in North America. ...|$|R
