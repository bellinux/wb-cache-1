5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E
25|$|The Champoeg name {{itself has}} an unknown origin. Some {{theories}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the Native American's {{name for the}} spot along the Willamette River, originally Champooik. Other theories <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is of French origin, or a French variation on the Native American term. The name would {{also be used as}} the name of one of the early districts of the government, later becoming Marion County, Oregon.|$|E
5000|$|Psunj {{was called}} [...] "Pisunus" [...] in antiquity. There are several {{suggested}} etymologies for <b>that.</b> One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{comes from the}} Indo-European root *pekj (cattle). The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European roots *peiH (big, in the sense [...] "mountain") and *sen (old). One very similar to <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from *peiH and *sewn (black). The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> related to the Latin word [...] "pinus", meaning [...] "pine tree" [...] or [...] "resin", itself without a widely accepted etymology.|$|R

30|$|The {{advantage}} of this method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can <b>be</b> applied to untriggered data. The disadvantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time consuming compared to the method described next.|$|R
25|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the dual trace oscilloscope <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot switch quickly between the traces and it cannot capture two fast transient events. In {{order to avoid}} this problems a dual beam oscilloscope is used.|$|E
25|$|Other {{minority}} identifications of manna <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a kosher {{species of}} locust, {{or that it}} was the sap of certain succulent plants (such as those of the genus Alhagi, which have an appetite-suppressing effect).|$|E
25|$|The stated aims of {{the system}} (introduction to Metis schedules) <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is child-centered and flexible.

50|$|The main {{criticism}} concerning R.A. 8371 <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous. One of {{the issues}} <b>it</b> encountered <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent and conflicting with the Philippines’ constitution (2).|$|R
25|$|The three {{principle}} {{strengths of}} Bayes' theorem {{that have been}} identified by scholars <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is prescriptive, complete and coherent.

25|$|Alan Scott wields {{a magical}} ring {{that can produce}} a variety of effects. The extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined, but three {{consistent}} traits <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> allows him to fly, that its effects are accompanied by a green light, and that it cannot directly affect anything made of wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has more specific energy {{than the standard}} kerosene mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater volumetric efficiency, in effect replacing an intercooler. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} to lower the temperature of the exhaust.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates', Plato's and Aristotle's {{ideas about}} truth are {{seen by some}} as {{consistent}} with correspondence theory. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle stated: [...] "To say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, or of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is false, while to say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, is true".

5000|$|In Hungarian {{the town}} is known as Valpó and in German as Walpach. In antiquity, it was called Iovalum. [...] There are several {{suggested}} etymologies. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Latin root *Iov-, meaning [...] "divine". However, the ending can't be explained by Latin. One explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European words *yow and *h2elut, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means [...] "magical beer." [...] The other, more likely, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European roots *yow and *h2elom, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means [...] "magical herb", whatever plant that signified. Perhaps the simplest explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European word *wel, meaning [...] "valley", whatever [...] "Io-" [...] meant.|$|R
25|$|According to some Christian traditions, {{a second}} work of grace is a {{transforming}} interaction with God which may {{occur in the}} life of a Christian. The defining characteristics of this event <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is separate from and subsequent to salvation (the first work of grace), and that it brings about significant changes {{in the life of}} the believer.|$|E
25|$|The root {{is known}} to be a {{powerful}} emetic. A proteolytic enzyme known as pedilanthain can be extracted from the plant's latex, and has been shown in experiments to be effective against intestinal worms and to reduce inflammation when ingested. In 1995, a galactose-specific lectin was purified from the plant's latex, and indications <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be useful in combatting diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|This curve has no {{more than}} a {{historical}} value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity deceleration and erosion is caused by flow acceleration. The dimensionless Shields diagram is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} {{for the name}} [...] "Odra". One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Croatian word [...] "oderati" [...] (to cut through). The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European root *wodr (water).|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} {{accounts of the}} origin on this apple cultivar. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> originated from Bismarck in Tasmania (now Collinsvale), which was a German settlement. Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> raised by F. Fricke, a German settler at Carisbrooke, Victoria, Australia. A third <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> originated in Canterbury, New Zealand. The fruit was grown in Victoria and also in England and across Europe until the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{alternative}} {{sources for the}} origins of the name. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the name of a schooner <b>that</b> <b>was</b> wrecked here. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> describes the state of the shore during a storm.|$|R
25|$|Although {{theoretically}} PB biopsy and blastocyst biopsy {{are less}} harmful than cleavage-stage biopsy, {{this is still}} the prevalent method. It is used in approximately 94% of the PGD cycles reported to the ESHRE PGD Consortium. The main reasons <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> allows for a safer and more complete diagnosis than PB biopsy and still leaves enough time to finish the diagnosis before the embryos must be replaced in the patient's uterus, unlike blastocyst biopsy.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantages}} of the gravitational microlensing method <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can detect low-mass planets (in principle down to Mars mass with future space projects such as WFIRST); it can detect planets in wide orbits comparable to Saturn and Uranus, which have orbital periods too long for the radial velocity or transit methods; and it can detect planets around very distant stars. When enough background stars can be observed with enough accuracy, then the method should eventually reveal how common Earth-like planets are in the galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Implants, as {{subcutaneous}} pellets, {{can be used}} {{to deliver}} testosterone (brand name Testopel). 6 to 12 pellets are inserted under the skin every three months. This must be done in a physician's office, but is a relatively minor procedure done under local anesthetic. Pellets cost about $60 each, so the cost is greater than injected testosterone when the cost of the physician visit and procedure are included. The primary advantages of Testopel <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> gives a much more constant blood level of testosterone yet requires attention only four times yearly.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the law of}} {{excluded}} middle, Aristotle wrote: But on {{the other}} hand there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate. This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true and the false are. To say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, or of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is false, while to say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, <b>is</b> true; so <b>that</b> he who says of anything <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, will say either what is true or what is false Aristotle ...|$|R
30|$|In a nutshell, the {{advantage}} of OPE <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> destroys {{the structure of the}} tree and {{the advantage}} of PPE <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> destroys the order information. Thus, by combining OPE with PPE, we remove both order- and structure-based linkages.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of the name of the ancient Krommyonas. The first version <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> got its name because of the onion production and the second version <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> got its name from the son of Poseidon Krommo.|$|R
25|$|Indications <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{probably}} had large seasonal changes in discharge, evident by cross-bedded sandstones deposited at stages of lower flow, although whilst the flow was seasonal, {{it is perhaps}} doubtful if this system was ephemeral in nature for there is relatively little evidence of any large-scale aeolian sandstones in the basinal settings of the Midlands. It is clear that more locally sourced material such as carboniferous limestone and reworked earlier Triassic sandstone from the Clent Formation just south of Birmingham were also important components of the river systems as they flowed northwards giving some indication of the relief of the basin margins.|$|E
25|$|The site of Karytaina {{is often}} {{identified}} with the ancient city of Brenthe, but although a settlement certainly existed there before the Frankish conquest in ca. 1205, few archaeological remains survive. The Greek archaeologist N.K. Moutsopoulos has suggested {{the existence of a}} 12th-century church inside the Karytaina Castle. The name of the town itself is of uncertain provenance: the most common theories <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> derives either from a Slavic root or is a corruption of Gortyna, but it has also been suggested that it derives from the Greek word for walnut, karydion, or from the female name Karitaina.|$|E
25|$|This {{powerful}} enchanted black blade is {{a member}} of a demon race that takes on the form of a sword, and as such is an agent of Chaos. Stormbringer's edge is capable of cutting through virtually any material not protected by potent sorcery, and it can drink the soul from (and thereby kill) an unprotected human upon delivering any wound, even a scratch. Its most distinctive features <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has a mind and will of its own, and that it feeds upon the souls of those it kills. Elric loathes the sword but is almost helpless without the strength and vitality it confers on him.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{suggested}} etymologies {{for the name}} [...] "Karašica". It's not explainable in Croatian. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Turkish words [...] "kara su" [...] (black stream). Second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Latin word [...] "Carassius", denoting several species of freshwater fish. Perhaps the most likely one <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European root *(s)ker, meaning [...] "to cut", in the sense [...] "the river that cuts through the valley".|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the name Coos is uncertain: one idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> derived from a Hanis stem gus- meaning 'south' as in gusimídži·č 'southward'; another idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> derived from a southwestern Oregon Athabaskan word ku·s meaning 'bay'.|$|R
