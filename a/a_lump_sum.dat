5|$|If the {{contestant}} has the Million Dollar Wedge, the $100,000 envelope {{is replaced}} with a $1,000,000 envelope. The $1,000,000 prize has been awarded three times: to Michelle Loewenstein (on the episode that aired October 14, 2008), to Autumn Erhard (May 30, 2013), and to Sarah Manchester (September 17, 2014). Contestants who win the $1,000,000 may receive it in installments over 20 years, or in <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> of that amount's present value. When the contestant fails {{to land on the}} $1,000,000 wedge, Sajak will reveal where it was on the prize wheel.|$|E
5|$|In October 1974 Abu Nidal {{formed the}} ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court {{sentenced him to}} death in {{absentia}} for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that {{it is unlikely that}} Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, but {{it was clear that he}} had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> of $3–5 million.|$|E
5|$|The Székelys were a {{community}} of privileged border guards. They fought in the royal army, {{for which they were}} exempted from taxation. A royal official, the count of the Székelys, was their supreme leader, but the Székely seats were administered by elected officials. The Saxons also had the right to elect the magistrates of their seats. They enjoyed personal freedom and paid <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> tax to the monarchs. The wealthiest Saxon towns – Bistritz, Hermannstadt and Kronstadt (Bistrița, Sibiu and Brașov) – owned large estates which were cultivated by hundreds of peasants. Dozens of Saxons and Székely families held landed property in the counties, for which they also enjoyed the status of noblemen. Saxon and Székely leaders were occasionally invited to Torda to attend the general assemblies, which enabled the leaders of the three nations to coordinate their actions.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Section 1002 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act {{provided}} for <b>a</b> one-time $15,000 <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> for the surviving veterans who are US Citizens, and <b>a</b> $9,000 <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> settlement for non-citizens.

5|$|Because {{the river}} was a free river, there are no figures for traffic on the lower river. However, it {{connected}} {{to a number of}} waterways on which tolls were collected, and so an indication of the traffic can be gained from the figures for these waterways. The main cargoes on Beverley Beck in 1730 were coal, bricks, turfs and wool, together with cereal crops, consisting of wheat, barley, oats and malt. Receipts from tolls more than doubled between 1732 and 1748, after which the tolls were let to an independent collector. The annual rent charged for this privilege doubled again between 1748 and 1792. There was a steady expansion of trade on the Driffield Navigation during the same period, as the dividends paid to shareholders rose from 1.5 to 4 per cent. In 1789, Bainton, Boyes and Co negotiated <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> payment to cover coal from the Aire and Calder Navigation to their new carpet factory and the export of their carpets in the downstream direction. The factory later became a corn mill.|$|E
5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors {{could hope to}} even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the army}} was summoned to {{assemble}} at York on 24 June, it did not approach Scotland until mid-August. This {{was due to the}} gradual arrival of army supplies (in some cases, with much delay — the King's own tents, for example, were not despatched from Westminster until halfway through July). Brown suggests that Henry was well aware of the delays these preparations would cause the campaign. At some point before the army left for Scotland, the muster was met by the Constable of England, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl Marshal, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. Individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> to later distribute in wages to their troops: Men-at-arms reived one shilling a day, archers half that, but captains and leaders do not apear to have been paid at a higher rate. The army left York on 25 July and reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne four days later; it was plagued by shortages of supplies, particularly food, of which more had had to be requested before even leaving York. As the campaign progressed, bad weather exacerbated the problem of food shortages, and Brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in the short duration of the expedition.|$|E

25|$|All these {{pensions}} {{were for}} services rendered, and although justifiable {{from that point}} of view, a preferable policy is pursued in the 20th century, by Parliament voting <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum,</b> as {{in the cases of}} Lord Kitchener in 1902 (£50,000) and Lord Cromer in 1907 (£50,000).|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{a company}} {{receives}} many rounds of financing (conventionally named Round A, Round B, Round C, etc.) rather than <b>a</b> big <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> {{in order to}} decrease the risk for investors and to motivate entrepreneurs. Pre- and post-money valuation concepts apply to each round.|$|R
25|$|In 1762 a new {{personal}} tax was introduced, the additional tax (ekstraskatten’’), <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> tax of one riksdaler’’ {{for each person}} above 12 years. The tax triggered a storm of indignation, and after a series complains to the king and regular riots, the Stril War, the tax was reduced and finally abolished in 1772.|$|E

5000|$|When a saver starts Income Drawdown, as {{with other}} options for taking a pension, {{he or she has}} a one-off chance to take <b>a</b> tax free <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> of up to 25%. [...] This type of <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> is now called <b>a</b> pension {{commencement}} <b>lump</b> <b>sum.</b> Anyone wanting to put off taking <b>a</b> pension commencement <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> until after age 75, should take independent expert advice from an Independent Financial Adviser about [...] "designation" [...] well before his/her 75th Birthday. Since not all pension providers permit postponement after 75, it may be necessary before the pensioner attains 75 for his/her Independent Financial Adviser to transfer the pension savings to another provider whose internal rules permit this. Whilst the Rules permit transfer, it can be quite a lengthy process in practice and involve investment timing issues (some Providers turn all the pot into cash and transfer a monetary sum to the new provider).|$|R
