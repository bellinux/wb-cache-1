When asked <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> agent said, Favre responded [...] "I am (in shape), but I am no way considering playing...The stress level was much, much more (when I played)....The demands are, don't get me wrong, I want to win, but it's not a job." [...] A few weeks later, in late October, the St. Louis Rams called Favre after their starting quarterback Sam Bradford was lost for the season, but Favre declined their offer to bring him out of retirement.|$|E

500|$|When Homer {{is chosen}} by the Republicans to pick their {{candidate}} for the next presidential election, his {{lack of interest in}} the current candidates leads him to choose Ted Nugent. He invites Nugent for a visit to the Simpsons' home, where Lisa complains that Homer has made the wrong pick since Nugent is [...] "out of his mind". Later that day, Homer has a dream in which James Madison shows him how ashamed past American presidents are of Homer. When he wakes up, he tells Lisa he will not be supporting Nugent for president anymore. He then sees a brochure on her dresser with a man posing as a president and offering help with fake dreams. Homer realizes the family faked his dream to convince him not to endorse Nugent. As a result, he angrily decides to go on television and express his support for Nugent. However, when he tries to bring out his ability to cry every time he discusses anything on television, he finds he cannot bring up those emotions because he does not truly believe in what he is saying. Homer [...] announces on television that he [...] "is full of crap" [...] and [...] reconciles with Lisa. As a result, Nugent is stripped of his position as the Republican presidential candidate. The episode ends as he sings a song <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> presidency would have been like.|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Fury, while being directed by [...] veteran, Jeff Hunt. It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we get up in the morning is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Friday saw {{yet more}} {{witnesses}} for the prosecution, {{bringing the total}} brought by Davy to about 60. [...] The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells's house. [...] Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish {{whether or not she}} could have been sustained for a month by the bread she claimed to have been given. [...] On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. [...] One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too stupid to have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing [...] "a little". [...] This, in Davy's view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile. [...] Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells's house before Canning had disappeared. [...] Two of Canning's neighbours testified to her [...] "deplorable condition". [...] Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. [...] The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a [...] "poor, miserable wretch" [...] at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped.|$|E

500|$|Time {{magazine}} writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode continued {{the development of}} the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons Springfield. Poniewozik said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] interview [...] "maybe the most perfect scene P has put together yet". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley [...] "one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, [...] "then took it way over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a [...] "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" [...] and wrote, [...] "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." [...] Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, [...] "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a [...] "current-generation Bob Newhart" [...] and [...] "one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys {{everything you need to know}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, [...] "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".|$|E
2500|$|During {{nearly two}} years in Europe he had found himself as much fascinated by what he could learn {{concerning}} the methods by which science {{could be made to}} help industry as by what he discovered about the organization [...] of institutions of learning.

To be {{the chief executive officer of}} a particular business offered only a limited range of influence; but to stand at the intersection of the realm of production and the realm of knowledge offered considerably more.|$|E
2500|$|Finkelstein {{states that}} his {{consciousness}} of [...] "the Nazi holocaust" [...] {{is rooted in}} his parents' experiences in the Warsaw Ghetto; {{with the exception of}} his parents themselves, [...] "every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis". Nonetheless, during his childhood, no one ever asked any questions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> mother and father had suffered. He suggests, [...] "This was not a respectful silence. It was indifference." [...] It was only after the establishment of [...] "the Holocaust industry", he suggests, that outpourings of anguish over the plight of the Jews in World War II began. [...] This ideology in turn served to endow Israel with a status as [...] "'victim' state" [...] despite its [...] "horrendous" [...] human rights record.|$|E

2500|$|Capp also lampooned popular {{recording}} idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley ("Hawg McCall," [...] 1957), Liberace ("Loverboynik," [...] 1956), the Beatles ("the Beasties," [...] 1964)—and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. [...] "Sinatra was {{the first}} great public figure I ever wrote about," [...] Capp once said. [...] "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> reaction might be, {{and we were all}} surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it.

Noah and Lauren share a kiss at Lauren's motel room while wrapped in a romantic moment, however Noah stops the kiss, feeling that he is cheating on Sandra, and he and Lauren apologize for letting it get out of hand.

60|$|Thirlwell {{left him}} {{and went to}} the machine, which made a jarring noise.

Driscoll's bemused mind could not grasp the thought of duty that demanded self-sacrifice, but he had animal courage and stubbornness. He would carry out what he had undertaken. Moreover, he might have animal cunning without having cultivated intelligence, and his strength and resolution made him dangerous. Thirlwell did not like Driscoll better than before, but it looked as if the fellow had saved his life, and although he might not have meant to do so, this counted for something.
