5|$|The {{chemical}} reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, {{in which one}} chemical is transformed {{through a series of}} steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes.

Enzymes act as catalysts that <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> reactions to proceed more rapidly. Enzymes also <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.|$|E
