40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls, certain polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins {{and certain}} polychlorinated dibenzofurans cause {{a variety of}} {{biological}} effects in experimental animals. The mechanism of the induction of certain enzymes is perhaps best understood. That is, there is binding of certain chlorinated biphenyls, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans to a receptor, translocation of the compound-receptor complex into the nucleus followed by an increased activity {{of a number of}} enzymes in the cell. Although the concentration of this receptor in various tissues of some mouse strains correlates well with the intensity of some of the biological effects observed in the mouse strains exposed to these compounds, this correlation apparently does not extend across various species. The current evidence suggests that the <b>acute</b> <b>toxic</b> effects of TCDD in various species is in some way associated with binding of TCDD to the receptor. However, biological effects of TCDD in addition to those resulting from binding to the receptor may be required to produce acute toxicity and, perhaps, other effects. The <b>acute</b> <b>toxic</b> effects of TCDD are probably caused by the parent compound rather than metabolites; however, this conclusion must be viewed as tentative. Also, it cannot be excluded at this time that biological effects other than acute toxicity may be caused by metabolites of TCDD.

An acute intraperitoneal (i. p.) or intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection of nicotine intensified convulsions and death dose-dependently. But those convulsive responses induced by nicotine (i. c. v.) were more rapid and shorter than those induced by nicotine (i. p.). <b>Acute</b> <b>toxic</b> effects of nicotine were dose-dependently antagonized by mecamylamine (i. p. or i. c. v.), but not by hexamethonium (i. p.). Nicotine (10 or 24. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) significantly increased dopamine, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in striatum. Furthermore, electrical lesion of striatum suppressed acute toxicities of nicotine. Pretreatment of SCH- 23390, but not of haloperidol or sulpiride, blocked nicotine-induced convulsions and death. Pretreatment of phenobarbioal, diazepam or MK- 801 also prevented acute toxicity of nicotine. Nicotine levels in the blood and cortex after an acute i. p. injection of nicotine (24. 5 mg/kg) were significantly higher in old rats than in young rats. Hepatic metabolisms of nicotine decreased age-relatedly. Also, nicotine (24. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) -induced lethality tended to increase in old rats.
