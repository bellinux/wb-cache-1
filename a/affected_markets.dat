5|$|Sharing {{agreements}} {{may also}} be used as a loophole to control television stations in situations where it is legally impossible to own them outright. For instance, FCC regulations only allow a single company to own more than one full-powered television station in a given market if there are at least eight distinct station owners, and also prohibits the ownership of two or more of the four highest-rated stations (based on total day viewership) in a market. An LMA or similar agreement does not affect the ownership of the station's license, meaning that they do not require the approval of the FCC to establish, and the two stations are still legally considered separate operations from a licensing standpoint. Both Tribune Media and the Gannett Company were required to use shared services agreements as a similar loophole to take control of certain stations in their respective 2013 purchases of Local TV and Belo, as they did not have exemptions to the FCC's newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in the <b>affected</b> <b>markets.</b> Both companies have since spun out their publishing arms as independent companies; the Tribune Publishing Company and Gannett Company. Tegna, who holds the former Gannett's broadcasting and digital media properties, re-acquired the licenses for most of the affected stations following the split.|$|E

50|$|With ABC, NBC and CBS {{suddenly}} {{in need of}} new affiliates in the markets affected by the New World and Burnham deals, major affiliation shakeups began to occur.

50|$|Because Fox {{programmed}} {{far fewer}} hours of network content than CBS, NBC and ABC, the affiliation transactions {{in which the}} former aligned with stations previously affiliated {{with one of the}} latter three established networks resulted in time slots being opened up on the new Fox affiliates for those stations to fill via syndication. Despite this, several popular first-run syndicated programs at the time (such as The Oprah Winfrey Show, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Entertainment Tonight) were dropped by many of the New World stations - with a few exceptions - which replaced them with lower-budget syndicated programs or newer series (such as Access Hollywood and Judge Judy, the latter of which has since become a staple of many Fox stations). In several of the <b>affected</b> <b>markets,</b> the stations that switched to Fox kept or later acquired some of the aforementioned programs (for example, WVUE and WLUK now air both Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!; while KHON continued to carry Oprah until it ended in May 2011 and continues to carry Wheel).|$|E
5000|$|On May 21, 2008, High Plains Broadcasting {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} the license assets of WTEV and six other stations from Newport Television due to ownership conflicts in the <b>affected</b> <b>markets</b> (including Jacksonville).

It effectively made High Plains Broadcasting a front company or [...] "shell corporation" [...] for Newport Television, similar to the existing relationships between the Nexstar Broadcasting Group and Mission Broadcasting and the Sinclair Broadcast Group and Cunningham Broadcasting. This arrangement also placed WAWS in the unusual position of being the senior partner as a Fox-affiliated station in a virtual duopoly with a CBS affiliate (the Fox station normally serves as the junior partner in most virtual or legal duopolies involving a Fox affiliate and a Big Three-affiliated station). WAWS is the only television station in the Jacksonville market that has never changed its primary network affiliation.|$|E

5000|$|New World {{subsequently}} {{entered into}} a deal with News Corporation {{that would result in}} most of New World's television stations (which were primarily CBS affiliates, along with a few ABC and NBC stations) switching from their [...] "Big Three" [...] network affiliations to join Fox, causing the network's affiliations in the <b>affected</b> <b>markets</b> relocating from UHF to VHF stations. However, KNSD retained its NBC affiliation since Fox's San Diego affiliation was already on the VHF band through XETV. New World sold KNSD and WVTM-TV in Birmingham, Alabama to NBC in May 1996; the sale was finalized that August. Following the sale's closure, in January 1997, KNSD modified its on-air branding to [...] "NBC 7/39". In October 1997, NBC sold a 24% ownership interest in KNSD to LIN Television; in exchange, NBC acquired majority control (76%) of its Dallas/Fort Worth affiliate KXAS-TV from LIN.

50|$|The new Big Three outlets {{that were}} {{previously}} affiliated with Fox or operated as independent stations also dropped some first-run and off-network syndicated programs - mainly sitcoms and children's programs - due to local programming commitments and the heavier amount of programming being provided by their new network. The divested programs were acquired by other stations in the <b>affected</b> <b>markets,</b> primarily independents or charter affiliates of UPN and The WB. While these stations largely removed animated and some live-action syndicated children's programs from their schedules, {{some of the new}} Big Three stations continued to maintain a reduced syndication inventory that closely mirrored those typical of independent or Fox stations (at the time, CBS, NBC and ABC stations had begun refocusing their programming schedules outside of locally produced and network content around first-run syndicated shows, with a decreased emphasis on first-run and off-network scripted programs - dropping or scaling back sitcoms and relegating drama series to weekend early access and late-night time periods). A few of these newfound major network affiliates that retained certain off-network scripted series that they carried before joining their new networks (such as KSHB-TV, WGNO and WDJT-TV) chose to use those programs to fill select time slots traditionally occupied by local newscasts, until they were either able to start news departments or expanded their news programming output.|$|E

5000|$|If the blacked-out nationally {{televised}} game is being shown on a cable network (such as ESPN or the NFL Network), all {{cable and satellite}} television providers in markets that are within the 75-mile radius, in addition already to the primary market of the home team (which is already blacked out), must black out the cable broadcaster's feed to customers in <b>affected</b> <b>markets</b> during the game (this is a condition of the channels' agreements with both the league and the providers). In addition, the game is not simulcast on a local broadcast station in the blacked-out markets. Local stations would {{still be able to}} show highlights during their newscasts after the game has concluded. In areas where the game is blacked out, ESPN and the NFL Network would generally offer alternate programming (ESPN traditionally switches to a simulcast of ESPNews). As ESPN and NFL Network games featuring the local teams are syndicated in the local markets under the NFL's anti-siphoning policies, the station that holds local rights to the cable broadcasts but cannot show the games originally scheduled to be carried would either run their own alternate programming or, if affiliated with a major network, show the regularly scheduled network programming for that night. During the pre-season, blacked out games can be aired in their entirety, but only on tape delay (generally after late-evening newscasts).|$|E
5000|$|Tribune Broadcasting {{announced}} that its 42 television stations in 33 markets and basic cable network WGN America were pulled from Dish Network on June 12 at 7 p.m. (Eastern) {{after the two}} sides failed to reach a new retransmission agreement. This affected 7 markets where the 70th Annual Tony Awards were airing on CBS affiliates (including WHNT-TV in Huntsville, AL; KFSM-TV in Fort Amith, AR; WTTV in Bloomington, IN; and 5 others) that same evening {{an hour after the}} previous retransmission contract ended. This also impacts major market CW affiliates KDAF in Dallas, KIAH in Houston, WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles, and Tribune's flagship WGN-TV in Chicago (which switched to being an independent station on September 1). Dish proposed having an arbitrator to settle the dispute. Meanwhile, Tribune proposed to have the FCC chairman monitor negotiations between the two companies. [...] As the blackout reached its 2nd week, Dish sues Tribune over their [...] "Dump Dish" [...] campaign, accusing them of deceptive claims about worst customer service and hindering contracts with its customers, damaging the provider's good reputation. Tribune responded to said lawsuit calling it [...] "frivolous", and stated that they [...] "repeatedly offered Dish an extension through August 31, 2016, which Dish has continually rejected." [...] Throughout this spat, Dish customers in markets affected also missed out on Games 5, 6, and 7 of a historic 2016 NBA Finals and Game 6 of the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals on Tribune-owned ABC and NBC affiliates respectively. Dish Chairman and CEO Charlie Ergen said that the satellite distributor is prepared for the long-haul, adding that if necessary he could do without the channels indefinitely. Ergen also states that the longer this dispute continues, the less valuable the Tribune stations and cabler WGN America will be. As the blackout continued through August, customers in <b>affected</b> <b>markets</b> already missed NBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics in its entirety on its Tribune-owned affiliates, although NBC's sister cable networks were also showing select events.
