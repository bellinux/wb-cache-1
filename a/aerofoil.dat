5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an <b>aerofoil.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the <b>aerofoil</b> in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the <b>aerofoil</b> or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E
25|$|Gliding flight: falling at {{an angle}} less than 45° from the {{horizontal}} with lift from adapted <b>aerofoil</b> membranes. This allows slowly falling directed horizontal movement, with streamlining to decrease drag forces for <b>aerofoil</b> efficiency and often with some maneuverability in air. Gliding animals have a lower aspect ratio (wing length/breadth) than true flyers.|$|E

The <b>aerofoils</b> were tested at angles of attack ranging from 0 ° – 135 °. The tests were performed at a Reynolds number of 2. 16 x 105 based on chord length.

25|$|By {{combining}} a symmetrical <b>aerofoil</b> section with {{an automatic}} flap system the Mü28 has identical performance and handling in normal and inverted flight, resulting in a harmonious image whether flying inverted or in normal flight during aerobatic routines.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} element of this automatic system is a lever arm attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an equilibrium condition with the pitch control forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a high lift coefficient position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} high pitch control load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the <b>aerofoil.</b> The automatic system on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section <b>aerofoil</b> set at zero degrees incidence, with the automatic system only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E

25|$|Like the P.V.2, the new design, the Port Victoria P.V.9 was a single-engined {{sesquiplane}} (i.e. a biplane {{with its}} lower wing {{much smaller than}} its upper wing) braced with faired steel tubes. The fuselage, wider {{than that of the}} P.V.2, was mounted between the upper and lower wings, almost filling the inter-wing gap, giving an excellent view for the pilot. Armament was a Vickers machine gun synchronised to fire through the propeller disc, with a Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing firing over the propeller. Power was provided by a Bentley BR1 rotary engine. While the designers had hoped to use the same high-lift <b>aerofoil</b> section as used in the P.V.2, this was rejected by the Admiralty, who demanded the use of the more conventional RAF 15 <b>aerofoil,</b> which resulted in a larger aircraft with a reduced climb rate and ceiling.|$|E

25|$|The {{students}} at Akaflieg Berlin {{set out to}} improve the performance of modern gliders by reducing drag. To improve a modern glider's performance through modifying the <b>aerofoil</b> sections is time consuming and very costly, so to reduce costs the group utilised production wings from a Schemp-Hirth Janus B, shortened to 18.2m (59.71 feet), allowing the students to concentrate their efforts and budget on improving the fuselage.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of clean energy sources was realised rapidly after {{the negative effects}} of the pollution caused by generators on the environment became clear. Wind energy is a clean and renewable energy source whose applications exist worldwide. Some countries changed their national energy forward planning for renewable clean energy projects. In developed countries some researchers have worked on developing new kinds of wind turbines in order to produce a part of their power from renewable wind energy. The rotational speed of the wind blades can be increased using steering <b>aerofoils</b> surrounding the blades. A prototype of this wind turbine has been made in the laboratory; a ventilator whose flow rate is variable generates the ‘wind’. The blade profiles are designed using the theory of aerodynamics. The steering <b>aerofoils</b> are fixed surrounding the wind blades at an optimum distance. The number of the <b>aerofoils</b> and the angle of inclination (tilt) of the foils can be changed. In the experiment the ambient conditions are held constant. Because of the optimum adjustment of the distance and angle of the <b>aerofoils</b> the rotational speed of the blades can be increased by 32 % on the experimental device. In this paper the theoretical and experimental results will be discussed. # 2001 Elsevie...|$|R

40|$|A linearised {{theory for}} the {{steady flow of}} an incompressible, {{inviscid}} fluid through a linear cascade of <b>aerofoils</b> set in a channel with contracting or expanding walls is developed first for uniform, potential, flow at inlet and then for a shear flow to represent thick boundary layers near the endwalls. The results are compared with earlier work in which the effects of endwall contraction or expansion are {{expressed in terms of}} the Axial Velocity Ratio, i. e. the ratio of downstream and upstream axial velocities at mid-span, and it is shown that these earlier theories are in substantial error because they neglect the effect of the variation of circulation along the <b>aerofoils</b> and the velocities induced by the trailing vortices. Experimental studies of a cascade of NACA 0012 symmetrical uncambered <b>aerofoils</b> at a small deflection and pitch-chord ratio in a porous endwall tunnel, in a tunnel with contracting endwalls, and also with a substantially thickened endwall boundary layer are described and compared with the theory...|$|R

25|$|Sifaka, {{a type of}} lemur, and {{possibly}} some other primates (possible limited gliding/parachuting). A number of primates have been suggested to have adaptations that allow limited gliding and/or parachuting: sifakas, indris, galagos and saki monkeys. Most notably, the sifaka, a type of lemur, has thick hairs on its forearms that have been argued to provide drag, and a small membrane under its arms that has been suggested to provide lift by having <b>aerofoil</b> properties.|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic devices, such as wings, {{are used}} in higher levels of {{motorsport}} (Formula- 1 etc.) to increase the contact force between the road and tyres (i. e. to generate downforce). This in turn increases the performance envelope of the race car. However the extra downforce increases aerodynamic drag which (apart from when braking) is generally detrimental to lap-times. The drag acts to slow the vehicle, and hinders the effect of available drive power and reduces fuel economy. Wings, in automotive use, are not constrained by the same parameters as aircraft, and thus higher angles of attack can be safely reached, although at a higher cost in drag. Variable geometry aerodynamic devices {{have been used in}} many forms of motorsport in the past offering the ability to change the relative values of downforce and drag. These have invariably been banned, generally due to safety reasons. The use of active aerodynamics is currently legal in both Formula SAE (engineering competition for university students to design, build and race an open-wheel race car) and production vehicles. A number of passenger car companies are beginning to incorporate active aerodynamic devices in their designs. In this research the effect of ground proximity on the lift, drag and moment coefficients of inverted, two-dimensional <b>aerofoils</b> was investigated. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the effect ground proximity on <b>aerofoils</b> post stall, in an effort to evaluate the use of active aerodynamics to increase the performance of a race car. The <b>aerofoils</b> were tested at angles of attack ranging from 0 ° – 135 °. The tests were performed at a Reynolds number of 2. 16 x 105 based on chord length.

The IWT was chosen as it would allow enough height to reduce blockage effect caused by the <b>aerofoils</b> when at high angles of incidence. The walls of the tunnel were pressure tapped to allow monitoring of the pressure gradient along the tunnel. The results show a delay in the stall of the <b>aerofoils</b> tested with reduced ground clearance. Two of the <b>aerofoils</b> tested showed a decrease in Cl with decreasing ground clearance; the third showed an increase. The Cd of the <b>aerofoils</b> post-stall decreased with reduced ground clearance. Decreasing ground clearance was found to reduce pitch moment variation of the <b>aerofoils</b> with varied angle of attack. The results were used in a simulation of a typical Formula SAE race car. For a car travelling at 55 km/h, the use of active aerodynamics was found to improve steady state cornering by 9 % to 1. 89 g (wings @ 10 °), or alternatively its braking by 10 % to 2. 04 g (wings @ 45 °). With the wings in the ii low-drag position (0 ° AoA) the addition power requirement would be only 26. 0 W. However given the added complexity an active aerodynamic system would add the design, manufacture and testing of a Formula SAE race car, it is unlikely that such a system could be considered worthwhile...|$|R
