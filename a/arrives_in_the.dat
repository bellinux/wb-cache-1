5|$|The Qing Emperor's {{undercover}} emissary Jack Knife <b>arrives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{village to}} monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary Brass Body <b>arrives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy support beam loose, burying Brass under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father.|$|E
5|$|After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk <b>arrives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{engine room}} and discovers Spock dying of {{radiation}} poisoning. The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as {{his decision to}} sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's crew is a logical one, before succumbing to his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet. The crew leaves {{to pick up the}} Reliant marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V.

Mayil, believing that Sathyajith is the man for her, falls in love with him, to the point of refusing an opportunity to attend a teacher-training course in Madras to remain with him. Despite loving Sathyajith, she does not allow him to exploit her sexually, which disappoints him. Never intending a serious relationship with Mayil, he proceeds to his native place to get married to another woman.

Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} <b>arrives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
50|$|Humans first <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Trout Creek {{area around}} 10,000 years ago. A pit-house {{discovered}} near Willowdale dates {{back at least}} 5,000 years. The first European Americans to <b>arrive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area were fur traders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1820s, including a group led by Peter Skene Ogden. <b>The</b> first settlers <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s. <b>In</b> 1896 and 1897, gold and silver were discovered. The Ashwood post office opened in 1898, and it quickly expanded as silver and cinnabar mines operated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Many homesteaders <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1910s, and cinnabar production peaked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. After major floods <b>in</b> 1964, <b>the</b> United States Army Corps of Engineers straightened portions of Trout Creek, creating berms that have obstructed some of the creek's smaller tributaries.|$|R

5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner <b>arrives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
