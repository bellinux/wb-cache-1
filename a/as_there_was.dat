5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not prepared for this eventuality, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the court case, a female Scientologist was found {{collecting}} seven copies of the unpublished proofs from a copy shop in East Grinstead, near the Church of Scientology's UK headquarters at Saint Hill Manor.

On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} continue its investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn and McCain, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E

50|$|The {{territories of}} Yukon, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories use no exit numbers, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no freeways or expressways in the territories. Prince Edward Island has no exit numbers either, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one {{interchange}} in the province.|$|R
5|$|It wasn't until 2010 that Belgian Eugene van Roosbroeck {{received}} his gold medal {{for his part}} in the cycling road race <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no podium for winners following the race and the team returned to Belgium two days after the event having received no medals.|$|E
5|$|Lillestrøm SK {{originally}} used Jenseberg Stadion in Strømmen {{for their}} matches, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no suitable stadium in Lillestrøm. On 6 June 1920, the municipality opened Lillestrøm Stadion, where Lillestrøm SK moved their matches. In 1930, the club {{started working on}} plans for their own stadium. Led by the chairman Erling Nicolaysen, a stadium fund was established, which grew to NOK200. However, during the Second World War, the club's funds eradicated.|$|E
5|$|Major {{expansion}} of the network began with the commissioning of the 735kV AC power line in November 1965, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a need for electricity transmission over vast distances from the north to southern Quebec.|$|E

5|$|Parker's {{court had}} final {{jurisdiction}} over the Indian Territory from 1875 until 1889, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no court available for appeals. The legal systems and governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and other Native American tribes in the Indian Territory covered their own citizens, and federal law applied to non-Indian United States citizens in the territory.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the first}} {{published}} {{information on the}} cultivation of Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961. D.sessilis was among the species treated, but <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not yet any experimental data on cultivation, information was restricted to its aesthetic qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs.|$|E

5|$|The Reverend Samuel Marsden {{delivered}} the first sermon on 6 July 1824. In 1836 the first (and only) Bishop of Australia, William Grant Broughton, was installed at St James' <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still no cathedral. Broughton regularly officiated at St James' {{as at the}} first ordination of an Anglican priest in Australia (the Revd T. Sharpe) on 17 December 1836.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{international}} media presence in Vukovar, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> in the simultaneous Siege of Dubrovnik and the later Siege of Sarajevo, and relatively {{little of the}} fighting in Vukovar was broadcast to foreign audiences.

5|$|A {{military}} {{organization called}} Kölpények {{is reported to}} have existed in Medieval Hungary during the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries. Hungarian scholars have proposed that the Kölpények were identical with the Kylfings/Kolbiagi. Hungarian sources regard the Kölpények as being of Scandinavian origin. They were hired by the early rulers of the House of Arpad, particularly Taksony of Hungary in the 950s, to serve as frontier guards. They fought with their Magyar employers alongside Sviatoslav I of Kiev against Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire. Alternatively, the Kölpények may have been of Pecheneg origin, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a Pecheneg tribal group called Külbej during roughly the same period.|$|E
5|$|According to the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran, {{the films}} {{released}} {{during this period}} could not be classified as truly Indonesian films <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no sense of nationalism within them. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no evidence of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed {{to come in the}} next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
