40|$|<b>Agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> play an {{important}} role in Italian rural areas, as shown by the financial commitment to the Rural Development programmes. However, in contrast with other European Union (EU) countries, policy-makers still have limited experience on how farmers approach environmental incentive schemes. This paper casts new light on this issue from a northern Italian perspec- tive. The rationale of the farmers’ decision-making process is explored using two multinomial models. The first explains the probability of non-participation or participation in one of three specific <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> The model outcomes show that labour-intensive farming types and high dependency of household income on farming activity constrain farmers’ participation, whereas previous experience, easy-to-implement environmentally friendly farm practices and adequate compensation of extra costs encourage participation. The second model explores the effect of farmers’ attitudes and beliefs on their predispositions towards participation in any of the schemes. The results highlight that, besides income factors, the farm’s future in the business, and the relationship with neigh- bouring farmers and their opinions on environmentally friendly practices all have significant effects on adoption of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> The paper concludes by suggesting that farmers’ attitudes and beliefs, as well as the local behavioural influences, have to be taken into account when designing and commu- nicating <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|E

However, additional unsubsidised <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> that farmers perform are often ignored. The willingness to perform these measures may give a better insight into farmers’ motivation for <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> than subsidised measures because it likely depends only on farmers’ intrinsic motivation and not on extrinsic factors such as a financial compensation. In this study we used an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to investigate which factors are associated with farmers’ intention to perform unsubsidised <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> Our results demonstrate that attitude, perceived social norms and perceived personal ability are significantly associated with farmers’ intention to perform these measures. However, self-identity is the most dominant predictor of farmers’ intentions. Furthermore we found that Environmental Cooperatives (ECs) positively influence farmers’ willingness to perform additional unsubsidised measures by means of facilitation and group pressure. We conclude that in order to increase farmers’ willingness to perform <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures,</b> self-identity should be addressed by means of e. g. benchmarking instruments in combination with commitment making or labelling of environmental friendly identities. Also, ECs are more important for unsubsidised measures than previously assumed – we recommended that they change their focus to include unsubsidised as well as subsidised conservation. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an economic sector level {{analysis of the}} effectiveness of different policy measures in decreasing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) surpluses from agriculture in order to reduce nutrient runoff from agricultural fields to watercourses and to improve water quality of surface waters. Assuming no changes in the EU level policies after CAP reform 2003 we focus on national level policy measures such as full or partial de-coupling of national support from production, payments for reduced nutrient surpluses of N and P, and N fertiliser tax. None of the analysed policy measures is superior one with respect to environmental performance, since full decoupling of national support would be the most effective in reducing P surpluses while payment for reduced nutrient surplus performed best with respect to N surpluses. Economic performance (farmers compliance cost per %-reduction of N or P surplus) of full and partial de-coupling of national support is clearly better than that of specialised agri-environmental policy instruments, because both decoupling scenarios result in the increase of farmers income in comparison to base scenario, and thus compliance costs are in fact negative in these two cases. Our analysis confirms the fact that the overall policy package matters a lot for the effectiveness of agrienvironmental policy measures. Environmental performance of <b>agri-environmental</b> policy <b>measures</b> may be significantly reduced, if they are implemented jointly with production coupled income support policies. Thus, in order to increase the effectiveness of <b>agri-environmental</b> policy <b>measures</b> agricultural income support policies should be decoupled from production and this alone would bring substantial reduction in nutrient surpluses. ...|$|R

The work selected as a subject of the study agri-environmental contract and its characteristics and other institutions, of which maturity influence the effects of that policy. The main goal was to identify these characteristics of contract and assess their balance in relation to the purpose and subject of the contract and long term benefit of both sides of the contract. Attitudes on the maturity of the contract characteristics have been collected between farmers and state administrators in survey (as sites of the contract) on national level and also in four regional case studies. It was revealed that most of the contract characteristics were not mature enough to serve to long term benefit for both sides of the contract, which decreases potential effectiveness of the agri-environmental policy. These are for example: information availability, trust between sides of the contract, tendencies to strategic behaviour, power distribution in the contract, sharing risks in the contract, adequacy of compensation level. Control and penalty system was regarded as rather adequate. Not mature institutions and characteristics of the contract increase transaction costs of both sides of the contract and decrease willingness to renew the contracts in future.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of two simulated auction models (AM 1, AM 2) {{with that of}} classical payment mechanisms as a marginal flat rate payment (MFR) and average flat rate payment (FR). The models follows the one-shot budget constrained auction model first introduced by Latacz-Lohmann and Van Der Hamsvoort (1997), and subsequently by Viaggi et al. (2008) and Glebe (2008). The first model (AM 1) deals with one-dimensional bids and it allows farmers to make an offer about a per hectare agri-environmental payment {{that they would like}} to receive in order to implement a generic <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measure</b> on their agricultural land. In the second auction model (AM 2) we further extend the analysis, allowing farmers to offer a combination of payment and a measure of their uptake in the agri-environmental program (i. e. a share of their land to commit under the program). Once simulated for AM 1 and AM 2 the optimal bidding behavior of a population of farmer taken from FADN data of E-R 2010 and 2011, assuming a fixed budget level and the sole objective for the public regulator to maximizes farmers participation to the AEM, we analyzed the total payment, the total cost and the total contracted area comparing the result with MFR and FR payment. The results confirm that the auction has the potential to reduce farmers’ information rent when compared with uniform policy instruments. Though the scale of saving depends crucially on auction design hypotheses and farmers' expectation about the maximum acceptable bid cap. The simulation while reflects a number of plausible assumptions, also remains rather simplified and could be improved in further research. However, it can contribute to feed the debate at EU policy level about the role in considering auction design and bidding behaviour so as to limiting the inefficiency related to the actual agri-environmental payments. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter summarises recent {{findings}} on the impacts of <b>agri-environmental</b> (AE) <b>measures</b> (2008 - 13), with special attention to water loading and biological diversity. Indicator trends, and comparisons between sites subject and not subject to AE measures, were analysed. Measures with the most potential for reducing nutrient loading are those targeting fertiliser rates, nature management fields and plant cover. Biodiversity has benefited from farmer contracts regarding traditional biotope management, organic production, raising local breeds and so on, as well as non-productive investments like establishing constructed wetlands. Agricultural nutrient loading has decreased because of lower artificial fertiliser use, but nutrient leaching from manure around clustered animal production units is increasing and requires measures targeted to manure composition and disposal. The greatest threat to biodiversity derives from trends in landscape structure. Due to regional heterogeneity, the objectives, measures and support levels of the AE scheme should be customised more according to the region, production sector and individual farm, by means of farm-specific environmental management plans. vo...|$|R

The policy options evaluated are full decoupling, fertiliser tax, both combined and explicit payments for reduced nutrient surpluses. The impacts of the options are compared to the baseline assuming milk quota abolition and continuation of production linked CAP beef premia. Sector model results suggest that decoupling of certain degree would improve the effectiveness of targeted <b>agri-environmental</b> support <b>measures,</b> and in some cases considerable reduction in nutrient surplus is possible with relatively minor reduction in agricultural production and farm income.

40|$|In {{dry land}} {{areas of the}} Mediterranean region, farmers’ {{decisions}} are particularly difficult due to irregular rainfall. Yield risk, soil erosion and desertification are important problems. Decision-making behaviour of farmers is supposed to incorporate a particular concern in the adoption of strategies to decrease income variability, to conserve soil and to guarantee a comfortable level of income. Using a multi-criteria methodology, this article analyses the importance of various objectives {{in the decision-making process}} of farmers in the Mediterranean region. Simultaneously, the effect of the agri-environmental policy measures is evaluated when farmers maximise utility and when they maximise profit. These effects on soil erosion are also evaluated. The end of the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> changes the dry land crop activities to natural pastures, increasing livestock and the level of erosion. The <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> are effective in maintaining the traditional agricultural systems, and in promoting the adoption of soil conservation tillage techniques...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{problems}} related to environmental protection have {{become more and more}} important, involving a growing number of economic and social actors. The new role played by agriculture in this context requires not only innovations concerning policy instruments, but also an evolution of tools, such as those for environmental accounting and assessment, able to support the analysis of choices in a complex economic and technological context, characterised by a number of heterogeneous objectives. This paper illustrates a model (AGRI-ECO-AUDIT) set up with the aim of supporting decision making concerning the application of Reg. (EEC) 2078 / 92 in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). The aim is to verify the possible contribution of environmental accounting to environmental protection and improvement in agriculture and to identify policy strategies for the exploitation of such potentialities in order to improve agricultural and agri-environmental policies. The case study discussed here shows that the use of accounting tools for measuring and evaluating the multidimensional impact of policies and farming practices on the environment can improve considerably the information available for the decision maker, allowing a higher effectiveness of <b>agri-environmental</b> policy <b>measures.</b> Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Production linked {{supports}} {{are paid}} for agriculture in less favoured areas (LFA) in Finland {{in order to maintain}} agricultural production and farms. The CAP reform increased the importance of LFA payments and other payments which are still partly coupled to production. We evaluate if any significant environmental damage can be avoided without risking maintenance agricultural production in less favoured areas. We also evaluate the relative effectiveness of alternative policy measures to decrease nutrient surplus, promote biodiversity, and maintain production and farm income. The policy options evaluated are full decoupling, fertiliser tax, both combined and explicit payments for reduced nutrient surpluses. The impacts of the options are compared to the baseline assuming milk quota abolition and continuation of production linked CAP beef premia. Sector model results suggest that decoupling of certain degree would improve the effectiveness of targeted <b>agri-environmental</b> support <b>measures,</b> and in some cases considerable reduction in nutrient surplus is possible with relatively minor reduction in agricultural production and farm income. Fertiliser tax appears to be efficient especially when combined to decoupling while explicit payments on nutrient surpluses as well as full decoupling have some negative side-effects.

40|$|<b>Agri-environmental</b> policy <b>measures</b> are {{insufficient}} {{to ensure the}} provision of agricultural landscape attributes that would follow peoples preferences. The study suggests a landscape value trade (LVT) scheme to be implemented locally so as to ensure the supply of environmental services demanded by local citizens. The feasibility of LVT, a "user-financed" payment for environmental services (PES) scheme, is analyzed in a local case from {{the southern part of}} Finland. We examine both the land-owners (sellers) as well as the residents (buyers) dispositions. Almost half of the land-owners were hesitant towards LVT and for most of the attributes improvement they demanded compensation larger than their expenses. To examine buyers preferences for certain landscape attributes and also the existence of heterogeneity we employed a random parameters logit (RPL) with interactions model. Buyers preferences were found to be spatially heterogeneous and thus transaction costs are expected to significantly determine the LVT performance. However, the LVT plan that would incorporate the most significant landscape attributes, i. e. presence of grazing animals, buffer water zones managements on a natural state and renovation of production buildings, was evaluated to be feasible to put into practice while the aggregate benefits were almost twice as much as the anticipated costs. vo...|$|R
