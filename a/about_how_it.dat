The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is not telling the truth <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, {{and that he had}} a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E

5|$|They {{arrive at}} the planet and travel to an {{underground}} vault which had been ransacked. As {{they are about to}} leave, Worf discovers a secret chamber containing the sword. They are attacked by Toral (Rick Pasqualone), son of Duras who had hired the Lethean and wants the sword for the prestige of finding it. Kor, Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to the Runabout in orbit, they head into the adjoining cave system {{in order to try to}} get out of range of whatever Toral is using to block the transporter. As they travel through the caves, the Klingons begin to be affected by the prestige of the sword. Kor begins to talk <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II but Worf says that he should be the one to lead their people. Suddenly, Kor slips down the side of a cliff but refuses to let go of the sword. Worf grabs the other end of the sword, and tries to convince Kor to let go as he cannot pull him and the sword up.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

25|$|The Poughkeepsie {{connection}} allowed {{traffic to}} access the new Mid-Hudson Bridge, making the Taconic a more vital link in the state road network. In 1940 traffic counts increased heavily, showing that the parkway was now being used for more than the weekend pleasure trips it was originally intended for. The TSPC erected two more service areas, Shenandoah north of Hosner Mountain Road, and Todd Hill Road, to accommodate the increased traffic. The commission also closed (permanently, as it turned out) the bridle paths along the median strip in Putnam County, unsure <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would pay for them.|$|E
25|$|David Renwick {{wanted to}} write a detective series that dealt with the actual work of {{detection}} rather than action, which most crime dramas appeared to focus on at the time. Also, whereas most of these were about who did it (Inspector Morse or Taggart) and why it was done (Cracker), this new series would be <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was done, with such tropes as murders committed in locked rooms, a person being in two places at once or impossible thefts. Finding a culprit would still be part of the detective's job, but the emphasis would be on discovering how the crime was committed.|$|E
25|$|A {{previously}} unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by McKay was authenticated in 2012. The manuscript, Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem, {{was discovered by}} Columbia graduate student Jean-Christophe Cloutier in the Samuel Roth Papers, a previously untouched university archive at Columbia University, in 2009. The novel centers on the ideas and events that animated Harlem {{on the cusp of}} World War II (such as Benito Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia). Working in collaboration, Professor Cloutier (now at the University of Pennsylvania) and his advisor Professor Brent Hayes Edwards successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was found and its provenance verified.|$|E

25|$|After the Federal {{criminal}} investigation ended in 1996, Zimmermann {{and his team}} started a company to produce new versions of PGP encryption. They merged with Viacrypt (to whom Zimmermann had sold commercial rights and who had licensed RSA directly from RSADSI), which then {{changed its name to}} PGP Incorporated. The newly combined Viacrypt/PGP team started work on new versions of PGP encryption based on the PGP 3 system. Unlike PGP 2, which was an exclusively command line program, PGP 3 was designed from the start as a software library allowing users to work from a command line or inside a GUI environment. The original agreement between Viacrypt and the Zimmermann team had been that Viacrypt would have even-numbered versions and Zimmermann odd-numbered versions. Viacrypt, thus, created a new version (based on PGP 2) that they called PGP 4. To remove confusion <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> could be that PGP 3 was the successor to PGP 4, PGP 3 was renamed and released as PGP 5 in May 1997.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Wales and then-fellow {{member of}} the WMF Board of Trustees Angela Beesley founded the for-profit company Wikia. Wikia is a wiki farm—a {{collection}} of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. It hosts {{some of the largest}} wikis outside Wikipedia, including Memory Alpha (devoted to Star Trek) and Wookieepedia (Star Wars). Another service offered by Wikia was Wikia Search, an open source search engine intended to challenge Google and introduce transparency and public dialogue <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is created into the search engine's operations, but the project was abandoned in March 2009. Wales stepped down as Wikia CEO to be replaced by angel investor Gil Penchina, a former {{vice president and general manager}} at eBay, on June 5, 2006. Penchina declared Wikia to have reached profitability in September 2009. In addition to his role at Wikia, Wales is a public speaker represented by the Harry Walker Agency.

While there, they learn that an older woman has been found fatally stabbed near the D'haran army; Nicci and Richard determine that it is Sister Tovi. Nicci uses deception to interrogate Tovi, discovering that it was Samuel who stabbed Tovi and took the Box of Orden she was carrying. She also learns about the Chainfire spell, <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was used to obliterate everyone's memory about Kahlan, and that the Boxes of Orden were created in opposition to it. Later, Richard realizes that the Sword of Truth protected him from the Chainfire spell, which is why he was still able to remember Kahlan.|$|E

25|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Anime Now {{called the}} series his most {{anticipated}} anime of the season, being curious <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would handle {{the adaptation of}} a branching story into a single one. Bamboo Dong, Paul Jensen, Rebecca Silverman and Theron Martin at Anime News Network reviewed episode 0 and 1 {{as part of a}} preview of that anime season. Dong did not expect the anime's ending to be good, but was still interested in how the story would turn out, and appreciated the use of Chaos;Head-like visuals and atmosphere. Jensen did not, however, think the atmosphere worked, saying that it seemed like the show was intended to give a feeling of dread, but that it failed to do so, partially due to the large amount of information communicated to the viewer. Silverman thought episode 1, with the exception of some sequences, felt bland, but still worth watching for a few more episodes to get a grasp of what direction the story would take. Martin thought the story moved slightly too fast, resulting in some character motivations being weakly established. He enjoyed the visuals and music, but said that the character design, while attractive, looked unoriginal.|$|E
