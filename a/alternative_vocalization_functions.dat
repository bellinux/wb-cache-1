40|$|Interactive {{end-user}} {{training of}} machine learning systems has received significant attention {{as a tool}} for personalizing recognizers. However, most research limits end users to training a fixed set of application-defined concepts. This paper considers additional challenges that arise in end-user support for defining the number and nature of concepts that a system must learn to recognize. We develop BeatBox, a new system that enables end-user creation of custom beatbox recognizers and interactive adaptation of recognizers to an end user’s technique, environment, and musical goals. BeatBox proposes rapid end-user exploration of variations in the number and nature of learned concepts, and provides end users with feedback on the reliability of recognizers learned for different potential combinations of percussive vocalizations. In a preliminary evaluation, we observed that end users were able to quickly create usable classifiers, that they explored different combinations of concepts to test <b>alternative</b> <b>vocalizations</b> and to refine classifiers for new musical contexts, and that learnability feedback was often helpful in alerting them to potential difficulties with a desired learning concept...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of structured and re petitive sounds by striking objects is a behavior found {{not only in}} humans, but also {{in a variety of}} animal species, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In this study we examined individual and social factors that may influence the frequency with which individuals engage in drumming behavior when producing long distance pant hoot vocalizations, and analyzed the temporal structure of those drumming bouts. Male chimpanzees from Budongo Forest, Uganda, drummed significantly more frequently during travel than feeding or resting and older individuals {{were significantly more likely to}} produce drumming bouts than younger ones. In contrast, we found no evidence that the presence of estrus females, high ranking males and preferred social partners in the caller's vicinty had an effect on the frequency with which an individual accompanied their pant hoot vocalization with drumming. Through acoustic analyses, we demonstrated that drumming sequences produced with pant hoots may have contained information on individual identity and that qualitatively, there was individual variation in the complexity of the temporal patterns produced. We conclude that drumming patterns may act as individually distinctive long-distance signals that, together with pant hoot <b>vocalizations,</b> <b>function</b> to coordinate the movement and spacing of dispersed individuals within a community, rather than as signals to group members in the immediate audience...|$|R

In many species of animals, male <b>vocalizations</b> <b>function</b> to attract mating partners and coordinate sexual interactions. While male vocalizations have been well studied in several species, the <b>function</b> of female <b>vocalizations</b> in mating contexts is not fully understood. In Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), {{both males and females}} produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during sexual encounters with opposite-sex partners. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that female vocalizations play a role in sociosexual interactions by examining how rates of 50 kHz USV production vary in relation to the sex and gonadal status of the partner, and by examining whether the proportion of frequency modulated (FM) and constant frequency calls differs between these categories of social partner. The results showed that females produced a higher total number of 50 kHz USVs to intact males than castrated males, and produced similar numbers of calls to both categories of females. Females also produced a higher proportion of FM calls to male partners than to female partners, and spent more time in the vicinity of male than female partners, regardless of the partners’ gonadal status. Female USVs therefore potentially provide a measure of sexual motivation and may function to promote female mate choice in this species with multi-male mating and a high risk of infanticide.

40|$|Coordinated vocal {{displays}} of cooperatively breeding animals provide a compelling model for investigating the opposing motivations {{for engaging in}} conflict versus cooperative behaviours. Hypotheses for the function of coordinated vocal displays differ with respect to these motivations and have been traditionally investigated by using playback to simulate varying degrees of threat to individuals and groups. We evaluated the function of coordinated vocal displays by presenting territorial groups of cooperatively breeding rufous-naped wrens, Campylorhynchus rufinucha, with three playback stimuli: solos, duets and choruses. We found that all groups responded strongly to playback by approaching the loudspeaker together, vocalizing, and performing visual displays. A composite playback response measure showed significantly more aggressive reactions to all playback treatments compared to a preplayback control period, yet did not vary across solo, duet and chorus treatments. This suggests that the playback stimuli represented equally strong threats despite the varying numbers of contributors to each stimulus, and {{does not support the}} hypothesis that coordinated vocalizations are graded signals of threat in this species. Our findings stand in contrast to previous playback studies that have reported an increase in aggression with an increasing number of simulated intruders, or an increase in coordinated vocalizations in response to solo playback. We interpret the results of our study as evidence that coordinated <b>vocalizations</b> <b>function</b> in the cooperative behaviour of joint territory defence in the rufous-naped wren. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R

Purr calls were given under various circumstances (e. g., pre-flight, feeding, aggression) and communicated information over a short distance.

40|$|The {{ability to}} utilize contact calls to {{facilitate}} reunions with social partners {{has been documented}} {{in a number of}} species showing a fission/fusion social organization. Field observations and playback experiments suggest that African elephants use low-frequency rumble vocalizations to reunite with their herd members following periods of fission. Using a digital audio and GPS recording collar system, we documented the production of rumbles and subsequent movements of five adult female African elephants at Disney 2 ̆ 7 s Animal Kingdom, Bay Lake, Florida, U. S. A. This recording system allowed us to identify the producer of each rumble and to document the effect of rumbles on the movements of herd members relative to the caller. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence that spontaneously produced elephant rumble <b>vocalizations</b> <b>function</b> in part to mediate the spatial relationships of group members. Overall, the production of rumbles resulted in a net decrease in distance between the caller and her social partners. This approach behaviour was enhanced if the partner was highly affiliated with the caller, if the partner replied with a rumble of her own, and if the pair was initially far apart (≥ 61 m). Rumble production was likely to result in avoidance behaviour only when there was no rumble reply by the partner and the dyad was close together prior to the initial call. These results suggest that a general function of elephant rumbles is to promote spatial cohesion among separated group members, but they may also mediate a variety of other close-distance social interactions...|$|R
40|$|Some nonhuman {{primates}} {{have demonstrated}} the capacity to communicate about external objects or events, suggesting primate <b>vocalizations</b> can <b>function</b> as referential signals.

The authors analyzed the acoustic structure of screams of 14 individuals, {{in the role of}} both aggressor and victim. The authors found consistent differences in the acoustic structure of the screams, across individuals, depending on the social role the individual played during the conflict.

40|$|Group defence of territories {{is found}} in many gregarious {{mammalian}} carnivores, including lions, canids, and hyenas. In these taxa, group members often mark territory boundaries and direct aggressive behaviour towards alien conspecifics found within the territory (Boydston et al., 2001).

40|$|The Lombard reflex is an {{increase}} in the subject 2 ̆ 7 s vocal levels in response to increased noise levels. While it has been demonstrated in humans and a small number of mammals and birds including some whales, it has not been demonstrated in humpback whales. During their southward migration off eastern Australia humpback whales were tracked visually from an elevated land station. An array of calibrated hydrophone buoys was used to simultaneously track vocalizing whales acoustically and to measure ambient noise. Two hundred and ninety two social vocalizations were recorded and analysed from 15 passing groups of whales when there was no detectable boat noise or singing whales in the area. Vocalization source levels increased significantly by a mean of 0. 75 dB per 1 dB increase in background noise (broadband 40 Hz – 2 kHz). Unlike most previous Lombard studies, however, the vocal level increased even though the background noise was much lower than the vocal level.

40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{on-going}} comparative analysis of primate neocortex evolution, we describe the occurrence and distribution of a previously unrecognized group of pyramidal neurons, restricted to the superficial part of layer V in the anterior cingulate cortex of hominids and characterized by immunoreactivity to the calcium-binding protein, calretinin. These neurons were rare in orangutans, more numerous in gorillas and common chimpanzees, while humans had the highest numbers. These calretinin-containing pyramidal cells were not observed in the cingulate cortex of any other primate or mammalian species.

Recordings from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) revealed single-neuron and population activity differences. Pre-vocal activity appeared first after the go cue in vlPFC, showing onset activity that was tightly linked to vocal reaction times. However, pre-vocal ACC onset activity was not indicative of call timing; instead, ramping activity reaching threshold values betrayed call onset. Neurons in preSMA showed weakest correlation with volitional call initiation and timing. These results suggest that vlPFC encodes the decision to produce volitional calls, whereas downstream ACC represents a motivational preparatory signal, followed by a general motor priming signal in preSMA...|$|R

My results suggested that the kek-kek-kek call may have two meanings as an alarm call and as a call to excite mates. During courtship, vocal activity was most intense in the early morning (female fertile period), but during other stages of the breeding season, vocal activity occurred throughout the day and was related to parental care. My results suggested that <b>vocalizations</b> of goshawks <b>function</b> primarily in territorial defense, intra-pair communication, and protection of paternity of young.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that female birdsong is present in the majority of songbird species worldwide. In addition, the results indicated that female birdsong was already present in the common ancestor of modern songbirds. These results are rather unexpected as it was generally believed that birdsong has evolved especially in male songbirds by ways of sexual selection. Similarly to research on birdsong, research on long-distance vocalizations in mammals often focuses on males. However, within many mammalian species these vocalizations are used by females as well. This study provides an overview of the production of long-distance vocalizations by males and females in three mammalian taxa: simian primates (Simiiformes), ungulates (Perissodactyla and Cetartiodactyla) and bats (Chiroptera). Additionally, an attempt was made to determine the function of these long-distance vocalizations. Five functional hypotheses of long-distance vocalizations have been proposed: 1) defence hypothesis; 2) alarm hypothesis; 3) spatial coherence hypothesis; 4) intragroup competition hypothesis and 5) finding a mate hypothesis. Data on long-distance vocalizations in the three mammalian taxa were gathered from literature. Factors indicative for a call’s function, like call stimulus, consequence, and characteristics of the signaller, were included in the data acquisition. The results reveal that long-distance vocalizations were present in 63 species of simians, 26 species of ungulates and eight species of bats. These vocalizations were most often produced by individuals of both sexes within a species or exclusively by males. Females rarely produced long-distance vocalizations when males within the same species did not. All proposed functions were found in {{at least one of the}} researched taxa. The fact that long-distance vocalizations are present in both males and females and that these <b>vocalizations</b> serve distinct <b>functions,</b> suggests that long-distance vocalizations have evolved under different environmental and social conditions.

40|$|The most {{pressing}} concerns associated with conservation {{of the endangered}} Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) include habitat alteration and mortality caused by humans. Whereas considerable {{research has focused on}} manatee mortality associated with watercraft collisions, little {{attention has been paid to}} the impacts of noise created by watercraft. Potential effects of environmental noise on the habitat selection, distribution, and behavior of manatees are the foci of this dissertation, the primary goal of which was to understand and predict manatee behavior patterns as a function of environmental noise levels in the Sarasota Bay area. Manatee behavior was examined in terms of: (1) habitat selection and distribution, (2) activity budget, (3) vocalization usage, and (4) short-term response to playbacks of approaching watercraft. ^ The initial phase of the study used acoustic modeling and monitoring to relate transmission loss and noise levels in specific manatee habitats to animal distribution. High-use grassbeds were quieter than low-use grassbeds of equal species composition and density, indicating a correlation between manatee distribution and environmental noise levels. In the morning the presence of boats and their associated noise may also play a dominant role in the timing of grassbed usage. ^ The degree to which manatees alter their patterns of behavior and vocalization under different environmental noise levels was investigated in the observation phase of the study. Results indicated that elevated environmental noise levels correlate with the overall activity budget of this species. More time was spent in the directed, goal-oriented behaviors of feeding and traveling whereas less time was spent milling when noise levels were highest. When noise levels were elevated, manatees increased their call duration during feeding and milling behaviors, suggesting that ambient noise levels have a detectable effect on manatee communication and that manatees modify their <b>vocalizations</b> as a <b>function</b> of noise. ^ Manatee response to the playback of an approaching boat was assessed in the final phase of the study. Results indicated that manatees respond differentially to different categories of boat noise used in the playback study. The most pronounced responses to boat noise playbacks, relative to the controls, were elicited by personal watercraft. ...|$|R
