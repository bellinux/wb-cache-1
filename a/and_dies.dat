5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} another alternative growth strategy will evolve in the P. rebeli, {{in which the}} P. rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants for an even {{longer period of time}} than the slow developing larvae.

At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli).

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a general approach {{and a system}} tool for concurrent metal stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development. After analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the metal stamping development process and the interaction level among part design <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design activities, the needs for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design are explored in depth, and an activity model for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development is presented. A framework is proposed to support concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development by providing computer aided environments for part, process <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design, advisory tools for part stampability evaluation and part cost estimation, as well as process <b>and</b> <b>die</b> evaluation, <b>and</b> knowledge bases incorporated in the advisory tools. According to the framework, a design support strategy for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development is investigated to guide the coordination of design activities including material selection, part stampability evaluation, process planning <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design, as well as cost estimation. Based on the proposed approach and strategy, the system prototype has been developed employing the knowledge-based approach. The results of this research will facilitate the rationalization of stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development <b>and</b> thus reduce the cost of metal stamping development...|$|R

5|$|Avenged is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama focusing on John Warren, a young clerk, who is struck by a taxi cab while crossing the street. The chauffeur who struck him, Allen, decides to flee as a crowd gathers around John. Allen ditches his taxi on a country road and takes a train, successfully escaping. Six years later, the poor, ill and crippled John has become a timekeeper in a mining town. John's wife, who has taken care of him, sickens <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> Allen, unaware of John's identity, attempts to comfort him and listens to John's story. After learning Allen wrecked his life, John attempts to shoot him, but the specter of his wife stays his hand.
