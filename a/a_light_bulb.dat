5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (<b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
50|$|An LED {{filament}} <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> is <b>an</b> electric <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> {{which produces}} <b>light</b> with <b>a</b> LED {{that is designed}} to resemble the filament of <b>an</b> incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb,</b> sometimes <b>an</b> Edison <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> The bulb also feature the exact same design as <b>a</b> conventional incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b>|$|R

5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E

25|$|The Air Ministry was wary, {{partly because}} of {{previous}} bad experiences with would-be inventors. Matthews was invited back to London to demonstrate his ray on 26 April to the armed forces.

When the British Admiralty requested further demonstration, Matthews refused to give it.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is noted}} for one world record. A 110+ year old 4-watt light bulb, called the Centennial Light, {{housed in the}} Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department main station, is still burning. It glows dimly, but still {{functions}} as <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> The Guinness Book of World Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not, and General Electric {{have concluded that the}} bulb has been burning continuously since 1901 with the exception of power failures and three times it was disconnected for moves to new stations. The light bulb was manufactured by the Shelby Electric Company and was hand blown with a carbon filament.|$|E
25|$|A {{very small}} amount of water vapor inside <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> can {{significantly}} affect lamp darkening. Water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle. The equivalent of {{a drop of water}} distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening. Small amounts of substances such as zirconium are placed within the lamp as a getter to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.|$|E

50|$|The {{incandescent}} <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> has <b>a</b> spectrum overlapping {{the black}} body spectra {{of the sun}} and the earth. Some of the photons emitted by <b>a</b> tungsten <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> filament at 3000 K are in the visible spectrum. Most of the energy is associated with photons of longer wavelengths; these do not help a person see, but still transfer heat to the environment, as can be deduced empirically by observing <b>an</b> incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> Whenever EM radiation is emitted and then absorbed, heat is transferred. This principle is used in microwave ovens, laser cutting, and RF hair removal.|$|R

25|$|The {{start of}} the Kentucky Electrical Lamp Company, <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> {{manufacturing}} company was in 1899; it eventually was acquired by Kentucky Radio Company (Ken-Rad) in 1918 and later acquired by General Electric in 1945 and in 1987 acquired by MPD, Inc., created the light bulbs that illuminated the first night game {{in the history of}} Major League Baseball on May 24, 1935, between the Reds and Phillies at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. The Owensboro plant was a major part of General Electric's vacuum tube manufacturing operations, producing both receiving types and military/industrial ceramic types. In 1961, engineers at the General Electric plant in Owensboro introduced a family of vacuum tubes called the Compactron.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene is}} within a room where, at an open end on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms. The center is {{occupied}} by a horse falling in agony {{as if it had}} just been run through by a spear or javelin. The large gaping wound in the horse's side is a major focus of the painting. Under the horse is a dead, apparently dismembered soldier; his hand on a severed arm still grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. On the open palm of the dead soldier is a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. <b>A</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head (the bare bulb of the torturer's cell).|$|E
25|$|Electricity was {{generated}} by a nuclear reactor {{for the first time}} ever on September 3, 1948 at the X-10 Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in the United States, which was the first nuclear power station to power <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> The second, larger experiment occurred on December 20, 1951 at the EBR-I experimental station near Arco, Idaho in the United States. On June 27, 1954, the world's first nuclear power station to generate electricity for a power grid started operations at the Soviet city of Obninsk. The world's first full scale power station, Calder Hall in England, opened on October 17, 1956. The world's first full scale power station solely devoted to electricity production (Calder Hall was also meant to produce plutonium), Shippingport power plant in the United States, connected to the grid on December 18, 1957.|$|E
