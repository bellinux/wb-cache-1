This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew's effectiveness <b>and</b> <b>competence.</b> The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E
5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E
50|$|DISCO - European Dictionary of Skills <b>and</b> <b>Competences</b> is a {{structured}} vocabulary for {{the description of}} skills <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> in different contexts such as labour market, education, and training, and the recognition of qualifications. DISCO provides a skills <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> classification that is neither linked to occupations nor to qualifications. Instead it functions as a thesaurus of skills <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> {{which is based on}} existing international standards and classifications and thus represents a terminological basis for the description of skills <b>and</b> <b>competences,</b> occupations as well as personal skill profiles and CVs, job vacancies, and job requirements or for describing curricula, courses, Diploma and Certificate Supplements or learning outcomes in general. Available in ten language versions (CZ, DE, EN, ES, FR, HU, IT, LT, SE, SK), DISCO is meant to support transnational comparability of competences acquired in an educational or work context throughout Europe.|$|R

It also reveals a hierarchy level-specific job profile for logistics and supply chain management jobs based on the European Framework for Key <b>Competences</b> <b>and</b> the German Federal Employment Agency. Methodology A review of the literature on <b>competences</b> <b>and</b> skills in the field of logistics is combined with an analysis of 832 job postings by means of content analyses and thematic mapping. Findings The academic literature discusses more than 280 skills <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> related to the job profile of logistics and supply chain managers. The majority of these skills represent social skills. Analyses of job postings show significant differences in the required portfolio of skills <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> depending on the hierarchical level of the position. Contrary to the literature, job postings include more cognitive <b>competences</b> <b>and</b> meta-competences than social skills. Value The first contribution of our research is that competences were examined from the perspective of lifelong learning, revealing how this is applied in the field of logistics. The second is that our conceptual framework can be utilised to compare skills <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> between different hierarchical levels. The third contribution refers to identifying a set of skills <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> different to what had been presented in the literature. </p...|$|R

We conduct a multiple case study of three groups of everyday designers: families, hobbyist jewelers, and steampunk enthusiasts. We provide a description of the aspects of meaning, materials, <b>and</b> <b>competences,</b> as well as how they are interrelated, for each case. Our findings show that amongst these three aspects of the practice of everyday designers, it is the meaning of the practice that acts as the strongest motivator for practitioners. Materials, tools, <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> are hence largely determined accordingly. The implications of this study propose ways to design for practices with different types of meaning: foundational, aesthetic, and aspirational goals...|$|R
