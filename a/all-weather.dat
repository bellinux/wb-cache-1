5|$|<b>All-weather</b> {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every <b>all-weather</b> crew, and has begun construction of an <b>All-weather</b> Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E
5|$|As of 1955, Highway No. 5 is an {{excellent}} <b>all-weather</b> hard-top road running into Saskatoon and connecting with good roads to other centres.|$|E
5|$|In October 1996 GPC {{began to}} drill and reopen Chevron's wells {{and to build}} an <b>all-weather</b> road {{connecting}} Adar Yale to the garrison town of Melut.|$|E
5|$|One {{estimate}} is that 12,000 people were forced to move in 1999-2000 while the <b>all-weather</b> road was being built between Melut, Paloic and Adar.|$|E
5|$|Single-seat <b>all-weather</b> {{tactical}} strike, ground-attack fighter for the Indian Air Force, 35 {{built by}} BAe and 89 built by HAL (Shamser).|$|E
5|$|Single-seat <b>all-weather</b> {{tactical}} strike, ground-attack fighter {{version for}} the French Air Force, two prototypes and 160 production aircraft built.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} venue suffered with drainage problems, {{and from}} the 1970s {{it was no longer}} used for competitions. This forced Minerva IS to hold many of its trainings at Stovner stadion in Oslo and Jessheim stadion in Ullensaker. In 1976, Minerva IS took initiative to lay <b>all-weather</b> running track, but the proposal was rejected by the municipality. In 1990, Skedsmo Municipal Council initially voted to allocate NOK2 million for <b>all-weather</b> running track, but the funding was reallocated to fix a leaking roof on Skedsmo Church. No further grants were issued for the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} production model, <b>all-weather</b> capability {{because of}} advanced avionics, including AN/APN-131 navigational radar; 610 built.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December 1961, No.410 Squadron became Canada's first {{operational}} CF-101 Voodoo squadron. The Voodoo was an <b>all-weather</b> interceptor aircraft; {{its primary}} armament was the nuclear-tipped AIR-2A Genie unguided air-to-air rockets, {{and was used}} as Canada's primary means of air defence.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell {{design was}} {{therefore}} reworked into an <b>all-weather</b> fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company {{received a letter}} of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill {{the need for an}} <b>all-weather</b> fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.|$|E
5|$|The {{helicopters}} are to {{be replaced}} by AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin under the Norwegian <b>All-Weather</b> Search and Rescue Helicopter (NAWSARH) programme. The candidates for the NAWSARH contract of 10–12 helicopters was the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, NHIndustries NH-90, Eurocopter EC225 and Sikorsky S-92.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate <b>all-weather</b> and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Chew Magna has a King George's Field in {{memorial}} to King George V. Gymnasium facilities, squash courts, badminton etc., and outdoor <b>all-weather</b> pitches {{are available at}} the Chew Valley Leisure Centre between Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. There is a range of clubs and societies for young and old, including Scout groups, gardening society, and the Women's Institute. There is a cricket pitch and teams in Chew Magna.|$|E
5|$|Fighter pilots {{received}} no instrument training until very {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages {{and the need to}} produce pilots more quickly to replace losses. Galland also did not make sure <b>all-weather</b> flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force.|$|E
5|$|Herne Bay Tennis Club is {{situated}} {{on the outskirts of}} town and runs multiple teams in the Kent League, East Kent League and Dover & District League. Their facilities include four <b>all-weather</b> courts (two floodlit), up to six astroturf courts and a purpose built clubhouse. The club offers junior coaching and runs regular club nights for players of all ages and abilities.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good <b>all-weather</b> airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and air supply missions.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} delays that {{affected}} {{the development and}} deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, {{and the fact that}} the Soviets were working on newer jet-powered bombers that would render the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF began looking for a supersonic, missile-armed replacement for the Canuck even before it had entered service. In March 1952, the RCAF's Final Report of the <b>All-Weather</b> Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is a tandem two-seat, twin-engine, <b>all-weather,</b> {{long-range}} supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber {{originally developed}} for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft. It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy. Proving highly adaptable, it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become {{a major part of}} their air wings.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{responsible}} for the maintenance of numerous sports and recreation fields, including 40 grass/sand/soil sports fields, five FieldTurf fields, 35 ball diamonds, several <b>all-weather</b> surfaces, a bowling green, a croquet/bocce court, and a cricket pitch. The city also operates Percy Perry Stadium and the Poirier Sport & Leisure Complex. Privately owned Planet Ice features 4 additional ice rinks, and more rinks are found throughout the Tri-Cities.|$|E
5|$|A.V. Roe Canada Limited {{had been}} set up as a {{subsidiary}} of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1945, initially handling repair and maintenance work for aircraft at Malton, Ontario Airport, today known as Toronto Pearson International Airport. The next year the company began the design of Canada's first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Avro CF-100 Canuck <b>all-weather</b> interceptor. The Canuck underwent a lengthy and troubled prototype stage before entering service seven years later in 1953. Nevertheless, it went on {{to become one of the}} most enduring aircraft of its class, serving in a variety of roles until 1981.|$|E
5|$|F-16C/D: The F-16C (single seat) and F-16D (two seat) {{variants}} entered {{production in}} 1984. The first C/D version was the Block 25 with improved cockpit avionics and radar which added <b>all-weather</b> capability with beyond-visual-range (BVR) AIM-7 and AIM-120 air-air missiles. Block 30/32, 40/42, and 50/52 were later C/D versions. The F-16C/D had a unit cost of US$18.8million (1998). Operational cost per flight hour {{has been estimated}} at $7,000 to $22,470 or $24,000, depending on calculation method.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was re-posted to NAS Corpus Christi, {{first as}} a student at the Naval School of <b>All-Weather</b> Flight, and then as a flight instructor. In July 1951, he was sent to the Amphibious Warfare School at Marine Corps Base Quantico in {{northern}} Virginia for a six-month course. He then joined the staff of the Commandant, Marine Corps Schools. Given only four hours of flying time per month, he maintained his proficiency (and flight pay) by flying on weekends. He was promoted to major in July 1952.|$|E
5|$|Grants {{were issued}} from the {{municipalities}} in 2005, {{the size of}} which {{was determined by the}} population of each municipality. Multiconsult was hired to design the venue and construction started on 28 June 2006. Earthworks were completed by November and asphalting started on 16 May 2007. The <b>all-weather</b> surface was completed on 13 June and technical installations were completed by mid-August. The new venue was inaugurated on 1 September 2007. It cost NOK28.6 million, of which NOK15.9 million were paid for by the municipalities in ratio of their population. The rest was financed through a combination of betting grants, value added tax compensation and volunteer work.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Smith was {{selected}} as a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928–1930 {{from a list of}} over 25,000 pilots. Byrd selected Smith not only for his <b>all-weather</b> experience, but because of the respect he had for Smith's mother after meeting her. Smith flew a three-engined Ford Trimotor plane named the Floyd Bennett (named in Bennett's honor) and headed for the South Pole on August 25, 1928. He logged 70 hours of Antarctic flying during the time he was at the South Pole with Admiral Richard Byrd.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, {{was opened}} along the B3114 {{on the western}} part of the lake. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has <b>all-weather</b> surfacing, {{providing}} a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, {{to improve}} the aircraft's combat {{capabilities}} in the changing strategic environment, SAC initiated the Big Four modification program (also known as Modification 1000) for all operational B-52s except early B models. The program was completed by 1963. The four modifications were the ability to launch AGM-28 Hound Dog standoff nuclear missiles and ADM-20 Quail decoys, an advanced electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite, and upgrades to perform the <b>all-weather,</b> low-altitude (below 500feet or 150m) interdiction mission {{in the face of}} advancing Soviet missile-based air defenses.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{two types}} of {{fixed-wing}} aircraft were operated from Melbourne. de Havilland Sea Venom FAW.53 fighter aircraft were flown by 805 Squadron RAN and 808 Squadron RAN, while Fairey Gannet anti-submarine strike aircraft were operated by 816 Squadron RAN and 817 Squadron RAN. At {{the time of their}} arrival, the Sea Venoms were the only radar equipped and <b>all-weather</b> combat aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere. At Melbournes commissioning, the standard air group consisted of eight Sea Venoms and two squadrons of eight Gannets, with two Bristol Sycamore search-and-rescue helicopters added shortly after the carrier entered service.|$|E
5|$|The A-10A single-seat variant was {{the only}} version produced, though one {{pre-production}} airframe was modified into the YA-10B twin-seat prototype to test an <b>all-weather</b> night capable version. In 2005, a program was started to upgrade remaining A-10A aircraft to the A-10C configuration, with modern avionics for use with precision weaponry. The U.S. Air Force had stated the F-35 would replace the A-10 as it entered service, but this remains highly contentious within the Air Force and in political circles. With a variety of upgrades and wing replacements, the A-10's service life may be extended to 2040; the Air Force has no planned retirement date as of June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force did {{possess an}} {{aircraft}} which had an <b>all-weather</b> capability, radar-guided bombing equipment, and awesome destructive potential – the B-52 Stratofortress. The civilian administration, however, never considered utilizing the big bombers (whose operations remained {{under the control}} of the Strategic Air Command) very far north of the DMZ, believing that it was too overt an escalation. Air Force Chief of Staff John P. McConnell also opposed sending the bombers into the air defense environment in the north and limited B-52 strikes to Route Package One.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing E-3 Sentry, {{commonly}} known as AWACS, is an American airborne early warning and control (AEW) aircraft developed by Boeing. Derived from the Boeing 707, it provides <b>all-weather</b> surveillance, command, control, and communications, and {{is used by the}} United States Air Force, NATO, Royal Air Force, French Air Force, and Royal Saudi Air Force. The E-3 is distinguished by the distinctive rotating radar dome above the fuselage. Production ended in 1992 after 68 aircraft had been built.|$|E
5|$|The Emperador Stadium in Taguig, {{the main}} stadium of the UFL, has an <b>all-weather</b> {{football}} pitch made of artificial turf, developed by {{real estate developer}} Megaworld Corporation and constructed by All Asia Structures, Inc. The University of Makati Stadium, another former UFL venue, is the first football stadium built by a local university, and has a capacity of 4,000. Iloilo Sports Complex {{is the host of}} home matches from Iloilo F.A.. It hosted an international competition in the group stages of the 2013 AFC President's Cup.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service {{was formed}} in 1916, and Yosemite was {{transferred}} to that agency's jurisdiction. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, Tioga Pass Road, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916. Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of <b>all-weather</b> highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 {{through the efforts of}} Ansel Franklin Hall.In the 1920s, the museum featured Native Americans practicing traditional crafts, and many of the Sierra Miwok continued to live in Yosemite Valley until they were evicted from Yosemite in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-33 (-33; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-D) is an <b>all-weather</b> carrier-based twin-engine {{air superiority}} fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, {{derived from the}} Su-27 and initially known as the Su-27K. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel, and is air refuelable.|$|E
5|$|The Yellowhead {{began as}} the Yellowhead Red River cart trail. When the {{province}} was surveyed, the road {{evolved from a}} dirt to gravel to <b>all-weather</b> road known as Provincial Highway 5 from the Alberta–Saskatchewan boundary to Saskatoon, and as Provincial Highway 14 from Saskatoon to the Manitoba–Saskatchewan boundary. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the highway was straightened and widened. On August 15, 1970 the Yellowhead was opened for the northern Trans-Canada route. The highway was completely designated for the entire route as Saskatchewan Highway 16 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The car {{appeared}} in the early 20th century to be pulled by horse again in the dirty thirties. In 1906, cars could be registered, and plates were issued as early as 1912. In the late 1920s the roads were gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton, Saskatoon, the Battlefords, and Lloydminster. <b>All-weather</b> roads were developed in the 1930s, which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly. Roads also were constructed to allow for rain run-off, with a rounded top surface.|$|E
5|$|The largest plant task {{undertaken}} {{during the}} deployment was {{the construction of}} an airstrip at Opuwo. The squadron commander, Major David Crago, described how the road network in Namibia was better than expected; in retrospect, the squadron brought too much heavy road-making equipment. The squadron deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop (under Captain Nigel Catchlove) to Opuwo. Over a period of four months, Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an <b>all-weather</b> airstrip {{in one of the most}} remote parts of Namibia.|$|E
