5|$|The work {{is one of}} {{only two}} minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos {{features}} a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and timpani. The concerto consists of three movements. The first, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, is in the relative major of E-flat and features <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, returns to the home key of C minor and presents a theme followed by eight variations.|$|E
25|$|The play opens upon <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> {{colorful}} {{scene of}} Hase-dera {{at the height}} of cherry blossom season. Princess Senju, is praying at the temple for her late father and for Kotarō, her fiancé by an arranged marriage, who has gone missing.|$|E

The government's work is quite uniform, too; it about doubles the tiger's average. In six years the tiger killed 5,000 persons, minus 50; in the same six years 10,000 tigers were killed, minus 400.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that the global current account and global capital and financial account discrepancies are the twin result of a common cause. This cause can be identified in the payment of net interests on debt. Re-interpreting the World Bank’s definition of capital flight, we will show that both discrepancies can be consistently accounted for by Schmitt’s analysis of the double charge of net interests’ payments. <b>As</b> <b>strikingly</b> confirmed by statistical evidence, the pathological payment of net interests between countries explains away {{the mystery of the}} ‘missing surplus’ while accounting for what has been considered so far as an understatement of international capital flows...|$|R
25|$|The {{culture of}} Egypt has {{thousands}} of years of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest civilizations in Africa. For millennia, Egypt maintained <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> unique, complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of Hellenism, for a time Christianity and later, Christian culture.|$|E
25|$|A Nieuport-built Dunne {{appeared}} at the Paris Aero Salon in December 1913. Like the second D.8 it was a Gnome powered two-seater, but with significant differences both aerodynamically and structurally. It combined the double upper wing elevons into a single surface and had very rounded rear wingtips. The fuselage was slightly modified and built around steel tubes rather than wood. The interplane struts were streamlined steel tubes. It also had <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> simplified undercarriage.|$|E

25|$|Plakoglobin (also called gamma-catenin) has <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> similar {{architecture}} {{to that of}} beta-catenin. Not {{only their}} ARM domains resemble each other in both architecture and ligand binding capacity, but the N-terminal β-TrCP-binding motif is also conserved in plakoglobin, implying common ancestry and shared regulation with β-catenin. However, plakoglobin is a very weak transactivator when bound to DNA – this is probably caused by the divergence of their C-terminal sequences (plakoglobin appears to lack the transactivator motifs, and thus inhibits the Wnt pathway target genes instead of activating them).|$|E
25|$|As {{with almost}} all {{carnivorous}} plants, the flowers of butterworts are held {{far above the}} rest of the plant by a long stalk, {{in order to reduce the}} probability of trapping potential pollinators. The single, long-lasting flowers are zygomorphic, with two lower lip petals characteristic of the bladderwort family, and a spur extending from the back of the flower. The calyx has five sepals, and the petals are arranged in a two-part lower lip and a three-part upper lip. Most butterwort flowers are blue, violet or white, often suffused with a yellow, greenish or reddish tint. P. laueana and the newly described P. caryophyllacea are unique in having <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> red flowers. Butterworts are often cultivated and hybridized primarily for their flowers.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to {{this the}} ICC {{received}} data from laboratory based analyses, {{on the basis that}} these measurement environments are more controlled, involving more sophisticated measurement technologies such as the Vicon Motion Analysis system. These were subject to less measurement error. Data was provided by the Australian Institute of Sport, the University of Western Australia and the Motion Analysis Corporation system from the University of Auckland. The ICC also carried out further video based three-dimensional analyses on all bowlers during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England. Regardless of the biomechanical measurement protocol used, <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> similar pattern emerged: the normal biomechanics of cricket bowling, whether it be spin or pace, features an element of elbow extension. The average extension of a normal, seemingly legal delivery was 8-10 degrees for all bowler types. There were virtually zero instances of no elbow extension at all in accordance with the original laws.|$|E

25|$|Christian {{was obliged}} to match the Greek Classical style of the National Gallery (built in 1838 by William Wilkins 1778–1839), which was set {{immediately}} {{to the south of}} the NPG site and adjoined it on its east side, but he provided <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> original design for his main north block towards Charing Cross Road based on the style of a Florentine Renaissance palazzo. The first floor for this block has large round-arched windows which bear portrait busts in roundels of famous painters, sculptors, antiquarians and historians, including Hans Holbein, Sir Peter Lely, Sir Anthony van Dyck, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Thomas Lawrence, William Hogarth, Louis Francois Roubiliac, Sir Francis Chantrey and Horace Walpole. The impressive pedimented entrance block is richly treated with more portrait busts in roundels, which include that for the 5th Earl Stanhope (1805–75) whose campaign in parliament had led to the NPG's foundation in 1856 (the Gallery first opened in a Georgian house in Great George Street, Westminster, in 1859). He is flanked by busts of Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) and Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800–59), historians who gave support {{to the idea of a}} National Portrait Gallery. The entrance frontage is modelled on the facade of the late 15th-century oratory of Santo Spirito in Bologna which Christian probably saw on one of his earlier Italian study tours. Above the doors are the Royal Arms sculpted by Frederick C. Thomas (fl.1892–1901) who was also responsible for the busts.|$|E

500|$|In 3–2 BC, {{there was}} a series of seven conjunctions, {{including}} three between Jupiter and Regulus and <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> close conjunction between Jupiter and Venus near Regulus on June 17, 2 BC. [...] "The fusion of two planets would have been a rare and awe-inspiring event", according to Roger Sinnott. Another Venus–Jupiter conjunction occurred earlier in August, 3 BC. These events however occurred after the generally accepted date of 4 BC for the death of Herod. Since the conjunction would have been seen in the west at sunset it could not have led the magi south from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.|$|E
50|$|Huechys sanguinea {{can reach}} {{a length of}} about 20 mm. It is <b>a</b> small <b>strikingly</b> {{coloured}} cicada. The basic body color is deep scarlet with smoky-grey wings, but proboscis and limbs are deep black. These cicadas usually emerge synchronously in April. The specific name is from Latin sanguis, blood.|$|R

500|$|This {{movement}} {{to elevate the}} school matched a similar effort in New York City, when the Free Academy of New York, an early public high school, established in 1847 and opened two years later, was renamed the [...] "College of the City of New York" [...] and given degree granting powers by the New York State Legislature {{in the same year}} of 1866, and often called in years since, the City College of New York, a title officially renamed in 1929. It had <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> similar history to the future B.C.C. and in its impact on the public education efforts and culture of the nation's largest metropolis.|$|E
500|$|Even at such long odds, {{the danger}} was {{sufficiently}} {{great to be}} taken seriously. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying {{out a series of}} experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing. But at Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on the University's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, the only fissile isotope found in significant quantity in nature, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as [...] would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics have}} {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} the religious themes in the poem. Vincent Bucklet stated that the Four Quartets [...] "presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance. The whole work is, in fact, the most authentic example I know in modern poetry of a satisfying religio-poetic meditation. We sense throughout it is not merely a building-up of an intricate poetic form on the foundation of experiences already over and done with, but a constant energy, an ever-present activity, of thinking and feeling." [...] In his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in British poetry, M H Abrams claimed, [...] "Even after a quarter-century, T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets has not lost its status as <b>a</b> <b>strikingly</b> 'modern' poem; its evolving meditations, however, merely play complex variations upon the design and motifs of Romantic representation of the poets educational progress." ...|$|E
