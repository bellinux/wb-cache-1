5|$|Henry Fownes Luttrell, {{who married}} Margaret, Alexander's daughter, {{and took the}} Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747. The couple {{redesigned}} and redecorated the castle in a Rococo style, including the extensive use of the recently invented and highly fashionable wallpaper. Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend the New Way all <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of his mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto {{the inside of the}} Great Gatehouse in the process. A folly, Conygar Tower, was constructed by architect Richard Phelps to improve the view from the castle, and a larger park of 141 hectares (348acres) was built just to the south of the castle, requiring the eviction of a number of tenant farmers.|$|E

25|$|The RSM marches <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the Escort and, {{followed}} by the Ensign, approaches the Colour Party. Having saluted the colour with his sword, the Sergeant-Major takes it from the Colour Sergeant, freeing him to change and then slope arms. The RSM turns, marches to the Ensign, and presents the colour to him. The Ensign salutes the colour with his sword, sheathes the sword without {{taking his eyes off}} the colour, and takes possession of it.|$|E

50|$|Beginning {{with the}} fingers {{interlaced}} (palms out) above the head (as {{at the apex}} of Pārśvabhāga Vinyāsa), a back-bend is performed on the inhale. On the following exhale, the arms are brought <b>around</b> <b>the</b> sides <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in an arc, ending palms up in <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> body.|$|R
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding {{the back door of the}} house rushed <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.|$|E

The new cars had more powerful versions of the Detroit Diesel 6-110 engines, each of which produced [...] instead of [...] They also featured higher capacity air conditioning and more comfortable seating. The appearance changed slightly as well: the side fluting continued <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the car and the front-facing windows were smaller.|$|E
2500|$|The podaegi ( [...] , also spelled podegi) is a Korean carrier with {{a medium}} to large {{rectangle}} of fabric {{hanging from a}} very long strap. Traditionally the rectangle is quilted for warmth and wraps around the mother's torso, while the straps are wrapped snug under the baby's bottom and tied <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> to support and secure the baby on the mother's back. Western interest in the podaegi style has led to new wrapping methods which do go over the shoulders, and to narrower [...] "blankets". Variants of this shape include the Iu-Mienh/Hmong carrier and the Chinese bei bei. Iu-Mienh/Hmong carriers and bei beis are both customarily used with over-the-shoulder wrapping and often have stiff sections which help provide head support or block wind.|$|E

This road curves <b>around</b> housing {{developments}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> Sully Station shopping center, where <b>the</b> name changes <b>to</b> Westfields Boulevard. Poplar Tree Road {{had been a}} two-lane undivided road but in spring 2013 a reconstruction and widening project was completed, {{and it is now}} a four-lane divided road.|$|R
40|$|Strikingly {{different}} business {{behaviors among}} three main {{ethnic groups in}} Malaysia impressed me very much. Analyzing the backgrounds of those differences, I found 'environmental pressures' among others, has played substantial roles on urging people exerting their efforts in economic and business activities. In early stages of economic development, 'pressures for survival' played significant roles. Later, 'environmental pressures' all <b>around</b> came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> It is exciting <b>to</b> know that <b>the</b> attitudes among each individuals and also ethnic groups are radically different. Therefore, a concept, that is 'interpretation code', is introduced in this paper. I have tried to establish an analytical framework in reference to 'environmental pressures', 'pressures caused by ideals' and their relations to business behaviors...|$|R
50|$|For the takeoff, the swimmer {{pushes his}} or her hands away from the block and swings {{his or her}} arms <b>around</b> {{sideways}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the swimmer throws his or her head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back. The swimmer then pushes {{away from the wall}} with his feet. Ideally, the swimmer's back is arched during the airborne phase so that only the feet and the hands touch the water {{while the rest of the}} body is above the water line. This reduces drag and permits a faster start. On September 21, 2005, FINA modified the backstroke start rule regarding toes below the water line. The feet can now be above the water, but not above or curled over the lip of the pool gutter.|$|R
60|$|The coach driver went off, {{and walking}} <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the sanitarium the boys {{rang the bell}} sharply.|$|E

60|$|The {{two doors}} slammed {{at the same}} moment, and Weedon Scott waited for Matt to come <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> From inside the door came a low whining and sobbing. Then there were long, {{deep-drawn}} sniffs.|$|E
40|$|Drawing. A {{young woman}} with long dark hair squats or sits with her legs hidden under her skirt, facing right, with arms crossed on her knees. Her {{clothing}} is annotated: "white shift and blue petticoat". <b>Around</b> her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and right there is a jumble of objects, {{most of which are}} indistinct, but which include on the right a jar with a closed lid, and a jug. Further behind, a tabletop is indicated, on which there is a square box with a closed lid, with perhaps a plate on top of it, and a bigger jug to its right. Superimposed at the right, and not part of the same drawing, there is a vague silhouette of a standing figure. A female figure in a domestic context, with colouring instructions...|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} roadway then passes {{in front of}} Grand Central Terminal and <b>around</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, passing the MetLife Building and descending again to ground level through the east portal in the Helmsley Building, arriving at 46th Street. Traffic coming from the north reverses this pattern: up a ramp through the Helmsley Building's west portal, past the MetLife Building, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of Grand Central, and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and down again to 40th Street, meeting side lanes coming from 42nd Street, where <b>the</b> viaduct connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Park Avenue Tunnel or to Park Avenue proper.|$|R
50|$|The second {{assassination}} attempt was in summer 1944. No longer caring about Himmler, <b>the</b> conspiracy planned <b>to</b> kill Hitler with a bomb {{when he was}} attending another strategy meeting in a wooden barracks. When the assassin's bomb failed <b>to</b> kill <b>the</b> Führer, Boeselager was informed in time to turn his unexplained cavalry retreat <b>around</b> and return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> before suspicions were unduly raised. Because of Boeselager's fortunate timing, {{his involvement in the}} operation went undetected, and he was not executed along with the majority of the other conspirators. Philipp's brother Georg was also a participant in the plot, and likewise remained undetected; however, he was subsequently killed in action on <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front.</b>|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they came}} in sight of Hope Seminary and Mr. Sanderson drove around to a side door, to {{interview}} the housekeeper. Sam walked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> and rang the doorbell, and a maid answered his summons.|$|E
60|$|<b>Around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of {{the house}} Mr. Tippengray carried the ladder, and boldly placed it nearly upright, under Miss Mayberry's window. In astonishment that young lady looked out, and asked him {{what in the world}} he was doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Spouter. [...] "I {{want you}} to come <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the house {{and tell me what you}} know about this," [...] and he motioned to the cook to follow him around to the big veranda.|$|E
50|$|Pebbledene stands near Barn Point on {{the east}} side of Freeman Street, facing the Gulf of Maine, just south of the {{junction}} with Bay Haven Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof studded with gables and projecting sections typical of the Queen Anne style. The house is finished in wooden shingles on the upper floors, while the first floor is weatherboarded. An octagonal tower three stories in height stands at the northeast corner, and a porch wraps <b>around</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean-facing <b>front.</b> A smaller porch, sheltered by a continuation of the roof, extends over the center portion of the lower porch. The interior of the house retains much of its original design work, including fireplaces, with mirrored mantels, and an elaborate central staircase.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cross is}} 44.5 cm high and 29.5 cm wide, with a core made of oak. It is a Latin cross, but {{the ends of}} the beams are flared, a feature found in many Ottonian jewelled crosses. Through their double ridges and triangles, the {{trapezoidal}} extensions are very close to those of Cross of Lothair in Aachen, which is usually dated <b>to</b> <b>around</b> 1000. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> side of <b>the</b> cross is decorated with a chased gold sheet. A raised border runs around this side of the cross, with gemstones set in gold filigree and separated by pearls. A fine string of pearls borders the space. The colour and size of the stones on opposite sides match, so that the jewels appear deliberately organised and clear. On {{the lower end of the}} vertical cross beam the donation plate in cloisonné enamel depicts [...] "Mathild Abba" [...] and [...] "Otto Dux", both holding a standard-like cross.|$|R
5000|$|Two bicyclists start 20 {{miles apart}} and head toward each other, each going {{at a steady}} rate of 10 mph. At {{the same time a}} fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel of <b>the</b> {{southbound}} bicycle and flies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel of <b>the</b> northbound one, then turns <b>around</b> and flies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel of <b>the</b> southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between <b>the</b> two <b>front</b> wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover? <b>The</b> slow way <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> answer is <b>to</b> calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, northbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, southbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, <b>to</b> sum <b>the</b> infinite series so obtained. The quick way is <b>to</b> observe that <b>the</b> bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles. When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: [...] "Oh, you must have heard the trick before!" [...] "What trick?" [...] asked von Neumann, [...] "All I did was sum the geometric series." [...] Eugene Wigner told a similar story, only with a swallow instead of a fly, and says it was Max Born who posed <b>the</b> question <b>to</b> von Neumann in the 1920s.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed Dot again, {{and before}} {{he had time to}} say {{anything}} more she saw a carriage drive <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the palace. Then the door quickly opened, and what looked to be a lady came out and entered the carriage.|$|E
60|$|There was a rush {{from the}} inside, a sudden outpouring, {{and the next}} moment John felt a hand touch his shoulder. Steve dragged him <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the saloon before he could draw his breath or utter a sound. The rest crowded around.|$|E
60|$|They passed <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{and were}} {{amazed at the}} picture {{disclosed}} by the reverse of the gaunt, skeleton-like framework. For now was displayed Solomon's temple in all its magnificence, with huge pillars supporting a roof that seemed as solid and substantial as stone and mortar could make it.|$|E
50|$|A {{picket fence}} {{separates}} <b>the</b> small <b>front</b> garden from <b>the</b> driveway and footpath. A pathway from <b>the</b> drive and <b>front</b> gate leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door and <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern porch entry.|$|R
60|$|They {{advanced}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{door and}} knocked. There {{was no sound}} from within, and Andy walked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shed. The door was locked, but the key was on a shelf near by, and he quickly opened the door.|$|R
50|$|A fouetté turn (or fouetté en tournant) {{begins with}} the {{performer}} standing on one flat foot in plié (with knee bent). The working leg is extended and whipped <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side and then, once extended to maximum turnout, bent and pulled in to a passe or retiré position. The foot beats behind the knee and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> knee of the supporting leg before extending back out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the supporting foot transitions to relevé (heel raised), in ballet often rising to en pointe (on toe tips). These movements create the angular momentum needed for one turn, which is executed by rotating in place on the supporting foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Porter? Oh! I {{suppose you}} want to see me about that man, Obadiah Jones. Well, I'll tell you all I know. Come on back to where I can sit down. This lame ankle of mine is still rather weak." [...] And thus {{speaking}} Mr. Lawrence led the way <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> porch of the bungalow.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I reckon I know as {{much about}} what's what as any old crow that ever cawed,' Cheeko said with a laugh, as he ran <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{of the house and}} looked in. 'Mr. Man's boy Tommy knows too much to set a trap for me, and I'm going to teach him a lesson on the folly of leaving good corn where I can get my paws on it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two men are misusing some woman," [...] cried Ben, [...] "come on!" [...] {{and rushing}} <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the building, {{he found the}} rickety stairs leading to the house floor, and bounded upward. The door at the top stood ajar and he pushed it in, with Major Morris at his heels. The room at hand was dark, the {{struggle}} {{was going on in}} the apartment next to it.|$|E
60|$|A few further {{directions}} {{were given}} by the sheriff, and then he and the three Rover boys advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door of <b>the</b> old mansion. At the same time, with pistol in hand, the officer named Thompson remained where he was, while he named Rapp walked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> guard <b>the</b> rear.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff {{has fallen}} asleep while {{standing}} and then Anthony, Greg and Murray arrive. Murray suggests they wake him up, and Greg has everyone yell [...] "Wake Up Jeff!"

25|$|While not {{the fastest}} car all week, the #11 Castrol Holden VR Commodore was close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in most sessions, {{and the race}} looked like being a battle between Wayne Gardner, Craig Lowndes, Glenn Seton and the Perkins car. At the start, a minor {{collision}} between Perkins and Lowndes saw the tyre valve from Perkins front right wheel torn off, resulting in the deflation of the tyre, and a slow lap back <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pits. After replacing the tyre, and checking for other damage, Perkins roared down pit lane, trying <b>to</b> stay on <b>the</b> lead lap, a feat he accomplished.|$|R
