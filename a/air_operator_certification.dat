50|$|Varsity Express did {{not have}} an <b>Air</b> <b>Operator's</b> Certificate, so the company's flights were {{operated}} by Humberside based Linksair Ltd using a single Jetstream 31 aircraft. Varsity Express (like AlphaOne Airways before it) was thus an extreme example of what transport economists often term a virtual airline. It even outsourced its core flying operations. Because it neither possessed, nor had it applied for, an <b>Air</b> <b>Operator's</b> <b>Certification</b> from the Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom), Varsity Express was never subject to the regulatory scrutiny (with respect to financial backing and the sustainability of the proposed operation) that would have applied to a start-up carrier seeking to secure its own <b>Air</b> <b>Operator's</b> Certificate.|$|R

40|$|<b>Operator</b> <b>certification</b> is {{the process}} where {{production}} workers are trained, authorized, and given the necessary resources to inspect their own work. This case study evaluated <b>operator</b> <b>certification</b> systems in the manufacturing process at three major aerospace companies during the Spring of 1995. Within the manufacturing area, <b>operator</b> <b>certification</b> was observed in such operations as high volume machining operations, certain processing operations-such as leak testing, balancing, and painting-and production of high volume detail parts. This case study was initiated {{as a result of}} the data from the human resources focus group’s survey in 1994. Prof. Jan Klein found that the airframe sector had a significantly lower percentage of plants where production workers perform inspection tasks as compared to the engine and electronics sectors. While <b>operator</b> <b>certification</b> is not a new concept, it appeared to be a best practice within two of the three sectors of the aerospace industry. This case study was performed to investigate these high potential payoffs...|$|R

For <b>operator</b> <b>certification,</b> UND uses Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) simulators specific to a particular vehicle (e.g., ScanEagle, MQ-8, etc.). Actual qualification training is on hold until the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) puts standards {{in place for the}} use of UAS in United States airspace. However, students can learn basic operation principles and how UAS will function in national airspace. UND also conducts research funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory on task loading of UAS operators. This research compares single operators versus multi-operator crews and full auto-piloted systems versus remotely piloted systems.|$|R

40|$|Building <b>Operator</b> <b>Certification</b> (BOC) is a competency-based <b>certification</b> for {{building}} <b>operators</b> {{designed to improve}} the energy efficiency of commercial buildings. <b>Operators</b> earn <b>certification</b> by attending training sessions and completing project assignments in their facilities. The certification provides a credential for their professional development while also offering employers a way to identify skilled operators. Developed as a market transformation venture with funding from the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, evaluation research has shown BOC participants are saving money and energy in their facilities, and awareness among major employers is growing. BOC is now expanding to serve {{other regions of the}} country including the Northeast, California and Wisconsin. It is being offered as a turnkey program to interested organizations and utilities and can be operationalized within a year to serve customers quickly. It also serves as a platform for other energy efficiency initiatives such as building commissioning, EnergyStar benchmarking, and resource conservation manager. This paper will discuss {{the development and implementation of}} the Building <b>Operator</b> <b>Certification,</b> market response to BOC in the Northwest and Northeast, and energy saving and customer service benefits...|$|R

Examples of such accrediting agencies include, {{but are not limited}} to, the National Commission for Certifying Agencies and the American National Standards Institute."
