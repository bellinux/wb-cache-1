5|$|The first {{usage of}} M-129 on <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> in Michigan {{was on a}} roadway {{connecting}} Lake Gogebic State Park to Marenisco and south to the Wisconsin state line; this routing was designated M-64 in 1930. The second usage was for <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> in the Keweenaw Peninsula connecting Phoenix with Eagle Harbor. This second designation was extended in 1933 to Copper Harbor and replaced by M-26 in 1935.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>highway</b> {{along the}} route of M-137 {{connecting}} US31 south to the state park {{was added to the}} state highway system {{during the first half of}} 1930, initially lacking a designation label on the state maps of the time.|$|E

5|$|MSHD {{had plans}} to upgrade the US16 {{corridor}} to freeway standards {{in the middle of}} the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> in the corridor. The General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> in the US16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced much of US16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor.|$|E

5|$|US44 {{originally}} {{entered the}} village of Millbrook via NY82, North Avenue, and Franklin Avenue. On April1, 1980, the state of New York assumed ownership of <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> bypassing Millbrook {{to the west and}} north as part of <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> maintenance swap between the state and Dutchess County. The newly acquired roadway was designated as NY44A. On June5, 2007, NYSDOT announced that US44 would be permanently realigned onto NY44A. All shields along NY44A were replaced with US44 signage, and the NY44A designation ceased to exist. NYSDOT will continue to perform maintenance on US44's former routing through Millbrook. The portion of the routing that did not overlap NY82 is now NY984P, an unsigned reference route.|$|E

5|$|With the {{completion}} of I-68 and the change in its route number, the US48 designation was removed. In 2002, AASHTO approved {{the establishment of a}} new US48, this time for the Corridor H highway from Weston, West Virginia, to Strasburg, Virginia. This marks the third time that the US48 number has been assigned to <b>a</b> <b>highway,</b> the first use being for <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> in California that existed in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>highway</b> {{was first}} {{designated}} along Lakeshore Road in 1927 bearing the M-110 designation. In 2003, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) transferred M-110 to the Manistee County Road Commission.

I-8 reaches its eastern terminus southeast of Casa Grande Mountain Park at an interchange with I-10, which continues south to Tucson, and north to Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Rocky Schenck and was released on 28 April 1997. It features Barlow performing the song in France, walking down <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> littered with stage props and crew members actively changing the scenes as he walks forward. As he performs the chorus, he jumps off the set and walks towards his stage chair, where he sits and observes his surroundings.

5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had {{designated}} <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> numbered M-7 between Three Rivers and Centreville. This highway {{was extended}} east {{by the middle of}} 1936. The route connected US131 in downtown Three Rivers to US112 outside Coldwater. At the time of the extension, all of M-7 was a gravel road. Later that year, the original segment between Three Rivers and Colon was paved, and the state extended the hard-surface route as far as Nottawa in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} threat, Chris caused little {{impact in the}} Lesser Antilles. Overall damage from Chris was minimal. The storm dropped light {{rainfall}} in Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.09inches (78mm) in Fajardo. The rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks, which temporarily closed <b>a</b> <b>highway</b> in the northeastern portion of the island.|$|E
5|$|High {{waves in}} Taiwan washed an oil tanker ashore in Kaohsiung City; all 13 crew members were rescued with helicopters.
