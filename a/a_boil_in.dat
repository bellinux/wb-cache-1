2500|$|Ethnic tension came to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> 1855, {{during the}} mayor's office election. On August 6, 1855, [...] "Bloody Monday" [...] erupted, in which Protestant mobs bullied {{immigrants}} {{away from the}} polls and began rioting in Irish and German neighborhoods. Protestant mobs attacked and killed at least twenty-two people. The rioting began at Shelby and Green Street (Liberty) and progressed through the city's East End. After burning houses on Shelby Street, the mob headed for William Ambruster's brewery in the triangle between Baxter Avenue and Liberty Street. They set the place ablaze and ten Germans died in the fire. When the mob burned Quinn's Irish Row on the North side of Main between Eleventh and Twelfth Streets, some tenants died in the fire; the mob shot and killed others. The Know-Nothing party won the election in Louisville and many other Kentucky counties.|$|E

50|$|This {{civil war}} was mostly fought with {{mercenary}} troops on both sides, with Spanish Tercios playing a preponderant {{role on the}} royalist side.

The German occupation authorities saw in Feldmeijer a willing tool to keep Mussert's ambitions in check. The conflict between the SS and the NSB came to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> May 1943, and while Feldmeijer and Mussert made a public appearance together to show their good relations, in practice all ties between the NSB and the German SS were severed.|$|E

50|$|Sorghum beer {{is called}} bjala in {{northern}} Sotho and is traditionally made {{to mark the}} unveiling of a loved-one's tombstone. The task of making the beer falls traditionally to women.

After the mix has fermented for several days, it is strained - a somewhat labor-intensive task. Sorghum beer is known by many different names in various countries across Africa, including Umqombothi (South Africa) burukuto (Nigeria), pombe (East Africa) and bil-bil (Cameroon). African sorghum beer brewed using grain sorghum undergoes lactic acid fermentation, as well as alcoholic fermentation.|$|E

It came to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> May 2011, when a Mongolian herder's death led to ethnic Mongolian protests in Xilinhot and unrest in other parts of the region. It was the first major protests in Inner Mongolia in more than twenty years. Hu instituted a two-pronged policy of appeasement and force, addressing the grievances of the protesting crowds by making a visit to Xilinhot, meeting with students and teachers, and promising compensation for local herders and more strict regulations over business conduct. Meanwhile, he increased security presence across Inner Mongolia, including in the capital, Hohhot, to contain the unrest.|$|E
50|$|Chrysanthemum tea is a flower-based {{infusion}} beverage {{made from}} chrysanthemum flowers {{of the species}} Chrysanthemum morifolium or Chrysanthemum indicum, which are most popular in East Asia, especially China.

The resulting drink is transparent and ranges from pale to bright yellow in color, with a floral aroma. In Chinese tradition, once a pot of chrysanthemum tea has been drunk, hot water is typically added again to the flowers in the pot (producing a tea that is slightly less strong); this process is often repeated several times. Chrysanthemum tea was first drunk during the Song Dynasty (960-1279).|$|E

This caused their being suspects in the February 1896 disappearance and presumed murder of Colonel Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry. They were pursued by Sheriff Pat Garrett and a posse. Garrett and posse engaged in a gunbattle with Lee and Gilliand near Alamogordo at Wildy Well, with Deputy Sheriff Kurt Kearney being killed. Lee later testified that Kearney and Garrett shot at Lee and Gililland, who were sleeping {{on the roof of the}} house at Wildy Well, without even asking them to surrender. Lee and Gililland fired back in self-defense. Garrett and his men were pinned down and Lee and Gililland allowed them to flee. Lee and Gililland attended to Kearney, but he died of his wounds.|$|E
