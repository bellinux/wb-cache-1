40|$|Catorzenes Jornades de Foment de la Investigació de la FCHS (Any 2008 - 2009) Humans {{and animals}} realize cost/benefits {{analysis}} of our responses {{with the goal}} of use the lowest energy possible to obtain the major benefit. Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) is a critic component in the cerebral circuitry regulating decision making based on the effort that the response requires, because it regulates behavioral activation. Research with rodents show that DA antagonists displace the behavior from the response that supposes more effort, though it has more reinforcement, to other behavior with less effort required. Interaction between A 2 A adenosine receptors and D 2 receptors play an essential paper in these processes. In the T-Maze paradigm the animal is exposed to an option of choose one arm with two food pellets, to which it accedes after climbing a 14 cm barrier, or to choose the arm without barrier and with only one food pellet. Control animals choose to do the effort of climbing the barrier to obtain the high reinforcement. Haloperidol, D 2 antagonist, produces change behavior towards the less density arm, been this effect partially reverted with theophylline, unspecific adenosine antagonist, and with MSX- 3, selective A 2 A antagonist. These drugs could have applications for the treatment of <b>amotivational</b> <b>syndromes...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Amotivational</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{psychological}} condition associated with diminished inspiration {{to participate in}} social situations and activities, with episodes of apathy caused by an external event, situation, substance (or lack of), relationship (or lack of), or other cause.|$|E
5000|$|A {{study done}} by {{researchers}} Barnwell, Earleywine and Wilcox {{also suggests that}} cannabis use does not cause an <b>amotivational</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The e-mail survey showed {{no significant difference in}} motivation (as measured on the Apathy Evaluation Scale) between cannabis users and cannabis abstainers. Studies of long-term cannabis users in rural Jamaica found [...] "the opposite of amotivational syndrome" [...] and determined it is a [...] "social artifact".|$|E
5000|$|The {{evidence}} for an [...] "amotivational syndrome" [...] among adults consists largely of case histories and observational reports (e.g. Kolansky and Moore, 1971; Millman and Sbriglio, 1986). The {{small number of}} controlled field and laboratory studies have not found compelling {{evidence for}} such a syndrome (Dornbush, 1974; Negrete, 1983; Hollister, 1986)... (I)t is doubtful that cannabis use produces a well defined <b>amotivational</b> <b>syndrome.</b> It may be more parsimonious to regard the symptoms of impaired motivation as symptoms of chronic cannabis intoxication rather than inventing a new psychiatric syndrome. https://web.archive.org/web/20040803223512/http://hyperreal.info/~emes/WHO/who-probable.html ...|$|E
5000|$|Other {{research}} done by Imperial College London [...] {{has found that}} long-term users of cannabis tend to produce less dopamine, a chemical produced by the brain which {{plays an important role}} in executive functions, motor control, motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and reward. The research also suggests that users of cannabis which started at a younger age may produce even less dopamine than those that began using later in their life. The cannabis users chosen for the study had all experienced psychotic-like episodes while using the drug and were selected as such because previous research hypothesizes that positive symptoms of psychosis are linked to excess dopamine production. However, the researchers found that the opposite was the case in these long-term cannabis users. Because dopamine plays a large role in motivation, the research suggests that long-term cannabis use may cause <b>amotivational</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Although little {{evidence}} supports cannabis-induced <b>amotivational</b> <b>syndrome,</b> sources continue {{to assert that}} the drug saps motivation 1, which may guide current prohibitions. Few studies report low motivation in chronic users; another reveals that they have higher subjective wellbeing. To assess differences in motivation and subjective wellbeing, we used a large sample (N = 487) and strict definitions of cannabis use (7 days/week) and abstinence (never). Standard statistical techniques showed no differences. Robust statistical methods controlling for heteroscedasticity, non-normality and extreme values found no differences in motivation but a small difference in subjective wellbeing. Medical users of cannabis reporting health problems tended to account for {{a significant portion of}} subjective wellbeing differences, suggesting that illness decreased wellbeing. All p-values were above p =. 05. Thus, daily use of cannabis does not impair motivation. Its impact on subjective wellbeing is small and may actually reflect lower wellbeing due to medical symptoms rather than actual consumption of the plant. </p...|$|E
