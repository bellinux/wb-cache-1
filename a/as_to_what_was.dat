5|$|When Soviet troops, {{pursuant}} to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was {{to ensure that the}} occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that their new territories would elect assemblies which would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) on 1 November 1939. Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.|$|E

25|$|In 1852 the Original Secession Church {{joined the}} Free Church; in 1876 {{most of the}} Reformed Presbyterian Church {{followed}} suit. However, a leadership-led attempt to unite with the United Presbyterians was not successful. These attempts began as early as 1863 when the Free Church began talks with the UPC {{with a view to}} a union. However, a report laid before the Assembly of 1864 showed that the two churches were not agreed as to the relationship between state and church. The Free Church maintained that national resources could be used in aid of the church, provided that the state abstain from all interference in its internal government. The United Presbyterians held that, as the state had no authority in spiritual things, it was not within its jurisdiction to legislate <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> true in religion, prescribe a creed or any form of worship for its subjects, or to endow the church from national resources. Any union would therefore have to leave this question open. At the time this difference was sufficient to preclude the union being pursued.|$|E
25|$|Further reason {{cited by}} Both Fay and Lebra and other authors {{indicate}} monetary and situational scopes, {{as well as}} the resentment at the abandonment of the Indian troops at Singapore by their White comrades and the officers. Controversy exists <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> actually said by Col J.C. Hunt in the first of the three speeches during the surrender ceremony for the Indian troops at Farrer Park on 17 February 1942. Fay writes in 1993 that a number of the troops gathered at the park remembers Hunt as having told the troops that they now belonged to the Japanese army and should obey their orders while Hunt only remembers having said that they were all Prisoners of War of the Japanese Nevertheless, Fay also points out that {{the fact that they were}} all POWs was already self-evident, and the fact that they were addressed separately implies some significance. A number of INA veterans present at the ceremony have said that, for the Indian troops, this also fed a feeling of devaluation (handed over like cattle, as Shah Nawaz Khan later put it), abandonment and of dishonour on part of the British high command that they perceived to have served loyalty.|$|E

500|$|Tom Wright {{described}} {{working on}} [...] "Tuvix" [...] {{as an exercise}} in forcing himself to work outside his known comfort areas and confessed he was unsure {{of the quality of}} the end product. [...] The actor complained about what he saw as a lack of support and guidance from the Voyager team, saying he felt adrift and unsure <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> expected of his performance, especially since his portrayal reflected two of the starring characters. [...] However, he also conceded that it may have been intentional in an effort to evoke a genuine sense of off-balancedness in the character. [...] Either way, though he was unaccustomed to the environment, Wright expressed his willingness to revisit Tuvix or even work on any Star Trek again if the opportunity arose. [...] In interviews, Wright specifically fondly recalled his time working with Jennifer Lien (Kes), Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway), and director Cliff Bole.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the second}} new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall {{returned}} but {{appeared to be}} tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. At {{the start of the}} third morning, he bowled Alec Bedser off an inside edge from a bouncer to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task...and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." [...] Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> coming to them.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{considerable}} conservative reaction, {{ideas of}} unity joined with notions of popular sovereignty in German-speaking lands. The Hambach Festival (Hambacher Fest) in May 1832 {{was attended by}} a crowd of more than 30,000. Promoted as a county fair, its participants celebrated fraternity, liberty, and national unity. Celebrants gathered in the town below and marched to the ruins of Hambach Castle on the heights above {{the small town of}} Hambach, in the Palatinate province of Bavaria. Carrying flags, beating drums, and singing, the participants took {{the better part of the}} morning and mid-day to arrive at the castle grounds, where they listened to speeches by nationalist orators from across the conservative to radical political spectrum. The overall content of the speeches suggested a fundamental difference between the German nationalism of the 1830s and the French nationalism of the July Revolution: the focus of German nationalism lay in the education of the people; once the populace was educated <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> needed, they would accomplish it. The Hambach rhetoric emphasized the overall peaceable nature of German nationalism: the point was not to build barricades, a very [...] "French" [...] form of nationalism, but to build emotional bridges between groups.|$|E

500|$|Boniface {{seems to}} have been unable to correct his {{misunderstanding}} of the meaning of the Libellus on this point. But this was perhaps due as much to the fact that seventh- and eighth-century canonical authorities (especially popes) so frequently conflicted on this subject, as to Boniface's own interpretative error. In a long series of letters written to subsequent bishops of Rome — Pope Gregory II, Pope Gregory III, Pope Zachary — Boniface periodically brought up the issue of consanguinity and marriage, and each time he received a slightly different answer <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> permitted and what was prohibited. Suspicion about the authenticity of the Libellus {{seems to have}} ended with Boniface's death in 754, though misinterpretation of its chapter on consanguinity continued for long after that. Nevertheless, no medieval authority except Boniface is on record as ever having questioned the authenticity of the Libellus and its marriage chapter. In fact, there arose a vigorous tradition of forged documents that defended the authenticity of the Libellus and attempted to explain why it permitted, or (to those who followed the [...] "Roman" [...] system) seemed to permit, nieces to marry their uncles, or even first cousins to marry.|$|E
500|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser and Wright survived for 20 minutes, and Lindwall {{tried to break}} their {{resistance}} by aiming a few bouncers at the former. Bedser eventually inside edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135-run first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70, while Johnson took 3/72 and Johnston 2/43. Toshack was the other bowler used, sending down 18 overs {{for the loss of}} 23 runs. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice his bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried his captain had noticed the injury, but Bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler."

500|$|Counsel for the {{appellant}} {{argued that}} this was not a case of a decision reviewable on ordinary administrative law grounds, but rather a case where the exercise of the power depended [...] "upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact". However, the House of Lords disagreed with the argument. It held that the nature and process of the decision conferred upon immigration officers was inconsistent with the requirements for the establishment of any precedent facts. This was because the immigration officer had to consider a [...] "complex of statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines and other documentary evidence whose genuineness is doubtful, statements which cannot be verified, misunderstandings <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> said, practices and attitudes in a foreign state which have to be estimated. There is room for appreciation, even for discretion." [...] On the other hand, the court was not well placed to determine which of several conflicting statements made by the appellant were true, or to decide if other factors were material to the immigration officer's decision. The court had to determine the case based on affidavit evidence and, though cross-examination on such evidence was permissible, this did not usually occur in practice. As the case did not fall into the precedent fact category, the court was unable to judicially review the decision.|$|E

500|$|In game seven at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox held a 5–2 {{lead through}} seven innings {{due to an}} {{ineffective}} start by Roger Clemens, but the Yankees remained in the game because of three shutout innings of relief by Mike Mussina in his first career relief appearance. After Boston Red Sox starter Pedro Martínez gave up a run in the eighth, manager Grady Little visited the mound but elected to leave a tiring Martínez to complete the inning. Martínez then gave up a ground-rule double to Hideki Matsui, and Yankees catcher Jorge Posada blooped a double into center field that drove in two runners and tied the game. The game went into extra innings and {{in the bottom of}} the eleventh inning, leadoff hitter Aaron Boone, grandson of Ray Boone, a (retired) longtime scout with the Red Sox, hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield to left field, ending the game and the series, giving the Yankees their 39th American League pennant. The Long Island, New York, newspaper Newsday went to the press before the game was over, and thinking Boston would win the game, editorialized <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> wrong with the Yankees, and why they had lost the ALCS to the Red Sox. In a postgame interview, Red Sox firstbaseman Kevin Millar described the emotions in the Red Sox locker room: [...] "It was like we were all back in high school, like we'd all just gotten beat in the state playoffs, and everyone was going to graduate.... When you're a teenager and you lose the big football game, that's when you see guys cry uncontrollably. You don't [...] see that much at this level." ...|$|E
