50|$|The County Commissioners of each county voted {{whether to}} levy the 1% food and {{beverage}} tax proposed by Marion County. Sweetening the deal for those counties {{was the fact that}} half of the revenue from the tax would stay in the respective county. Morgan County was the only county to turn down the offer, yet in <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>vote,</b> it levied its own 1% tax - thus keeping all of its additional generated revenue.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{majority}} of those who voted at the referendum on 1 March 1979 voted in favour of the Act, the provisions were not put in place due to the additional requirement that 40% of the total electorate also vote in favour. The Scottish National Party subsequently refused to support the government in <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>vote</b> of no confidence. Home rule for Scotland would not become a reality until 1999 following the Scotland Act 1998 establishing the Scottish Parliament.|$|E

50|$|When Selene {{discusses}} Neville's {{plan with}} the rest of the group, most of them agree that moving the entire Moon will be meaningless, and building self-sufficient sublight starships will be better. <b>A</b> <b>later</b> public <b>vote</b> goes against Neville as well.

However the Camerlengo, Gioachino Pecci, advocated otherwise, and an initial vote among cardinals to move to Spain was overturned in <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>vote.</b> The conclave finally assembled in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican on 18 February 1878.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives {{voted to}} build a barrier along parts of the border not already {{protected}} by barriers. <b>A</b> <b>later</b> <b>vote</b> in the United States Senate on May 17, 2006, included a plan to block 860 mi of the border with vehicle barriers and triple-layer fencing along with granting an [...] "earned path to citizenship" [...] to the 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. and roughly doubling legal immigration (from their 1970s levels). In 2007, Congress approved a plan calling for more fencing along the Mexican border, with funds for approximately 700 mi of new fencing.|$|E

Cornero {{made a deal with}} Silvagni to lease the hotel casino and rename it the [...] "SS Rex" [...] (after his former floating casino in California). The Las Vegas City Council, aware of Cornero's history with the Green Meadows casino and his floating casinos, voted 'no' on approving his gambling license.

[...] Ebbsfleet United's first trip to Wembley Stadium, and victory in the 2008 FA Trophy added to the publicity for the project, [...] but questions about an internet society owning a football club remained.|$|R
50|$|In March 1844 Ashley moved an {{amendment}} to a Factory Bill limiting the working hours of adolescents to ten hours after Sir James Graham had introduced a Bill aiming to limit their working hours to twelve hours. Ashley's amendment was passed by eight votes, {{the first time the}} Commons had approved of the Ten Hour principle. However, in <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>vote</b> his amendment was defeated by seven votes and the Bill was withdrawn. Later that month Graham introduced another Bill which again would limit the employment of adolescents to twelve hours. Ashley supported this Bill except that he wanted ten hours not twelve as the limit. In May he moved {{an amendment}} to limit the hours worked to ten hours but this was lost by 138 votes.|$|E

The {{convention}} also established an interim or acting government for the Republic, which was still at war in rebellion against Mexico. They considered him for president, but elected David G. Burnet instead, by six votes more than Carson received. In <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>vote</b> they elected Carson the Secretary of State. President Burnet sent him to Washington, D.C. to lead a team to negotiate for recognition of and aid for Texas, then later named James Collinsworth to replace him as Secretary of State. When Carson learned of this from a newspaper he simply went home.|$|E
50|$|A few Championship Subdivision {{conferences}} {{are composed}} of schools that offer no athletic scholarships at all, most notably the Ivy League and the Pioneer Football League (PFL), a football-only conference. The Ivy League allows no athletic scholarships at all, while the PFL consists of schools that offer scholarships in other sports but choose not {{to take on the}} expense of a scholarship football program. The Northeast Conference also sponsored non-scholarship football, but began offering a maximum of 30 full scholarship equivalents in 2006, which grew to 40 in 2011 after <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>vote</b> of the league's school presidents and athletic directors. The Patriot League only began awarding football scholarships in the 2013 season, with the first scholarships awarded only to incoming freshmen. Before the conference began its transition to scholarship football, athletes receiving scholarships in other sports were ineligible to play football for member schools. Since the completion of the transition with the 2016 season, member schools have been allowed up to 60 full scholarship equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Matuschka's first {{poster for}} the group was an {{illustration}} of the Statue of Liberty with the 'no' symbol painted over Lady Liberty's right breast. In 1992, W.H.A.M.! sponsored Matuschka's image Vote for Yourself as a glossy, eye-catching mass media poster. WHAMMERS, as they were known, wheat-pasted this political poster at dozens of breast cancer rallies and demonstrations throughout the greater New York region.Fox Five News was the first mainstream media platform to air W.H.A.M.!'s breast cancer actions—using artwork created by Matuschka {{over a three-year period}} before pink ribbons became the symbol for the disease. <b>A</b> year <b>later</b> <b>Vote</b> for Yourself caught the attention of The New York Times photo editors.|$|R

After a long break, he returned in November to win the Breeders' Cup Turf and <b>a</b> month <b>later</b> was <b>voted</b> Cartier Champion Three-year-old Colt.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{one person}} one vote mandate. If voters could {{vote in a}} primary for one candidate, and then sign a {{petition}} for another candidate, this would violate that mandate. Some voters might sign a petition for the candidate they want, and then vote in the primary for the candidate who {{would be easier to}} beat. Since primary votes are anonymous, and a party therefore cannot remove that voter's vote after it is cast, the only remedy is to strike the voter's signature on the petition. As for signatures not counting if <b>a</b> voter <b>later</b> <b>votes</b> in <b>a</b> primary, that could be reformed since the political party would know in advance about the signatures if they are filed in time.|$|R
50|$|Later in his {{political}} career, Stennis supported {{one piece of}} civil rights legislation, the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act, which passed in the Senate by an 85-8 <b>vote.</b> <b>A</b> year <b>later,</b> he <b>voted</b> against establishing Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a federal holiday.

On 22 May 1860, the first Queensland parliament met. One month <b>later</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> to fund a new government house was successful. The site chosen for the building was a high point of Gardens Point overlooking the Brisbane Botanic Gardens and with expansive vistas of the Brisbane River.

25|$|Sectarian {{conflict}} {{played a}} major role in the May 1859 elections, with Catholics largely supporting the Conservatives and Protestants shifting toward the Liberals. Tupper barely retained his seat. The Conservatives were barely re-elected and lost <b>a</b> confidence <b>vote</b> <b>later</b> that year. Johnston asked the Governor of Nova Scotia, Lord Mulgrave, for dissolution, but Mulgrave refused and invited William Young to form a government. Tupper was outraged and petitioned the British government, asking them to recall Mulgrave.|$|R
50|$|Lee {{was later}} {{appointed}} to the Control Yuan and began a formal examination of corruption charges against Chen Shui-bian. In 2009, the agency found that two Special Investigation Panel investigators had contacted Chen Shui-bian as the corruption probe continued. The first vote to impeach State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming {{in relation to the}} Chen Shui-bian case was held in January 2010, and failed. Three weeks <b>later,</b> <b>a</b> second <b>vote</b> on the impeachment of Chen Tsung-ming passed, and Chen subsequently resigned his post.|$|R
5|$|Chances {{the bill}} would be passed ended in November 2004 when House Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly decided not to bring the bill to <b>a</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>Later</b> that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance.

50|$|In the {{so-called}} Continuous Ministry {{of the late}} 1890s, Dickson attained the positions of Secretary for Railways in 1897, Postmaster-General and Home Secretary 1898-99. In September 1898, {{after the death of}} Thomas Byrnes he was made Premier. The Continuous Ministry by this stage was falling apart, and Dickson had only a brief period in office before Anderson Dawson gained the support of the Legislative Assembly to become the leader of the world's first Labour Party government. The Ministerialists regrouped <b>a</b> week <b>later</b> to <b>vote</b> Dawson out of office. Dickson lacked support to become Premier again, and that position instead went to Robert Philp, in whose government Dickson was Chief Secretary.|$|R
50|$|The Miller Air Park Association {{appealed the}} decision, {{along with several}} private {{citizens}} concerned that the tower would threaten the area's rural character. In September 2012, Rowan County Superior Court judge W. David Lee ruled that the change in tower height {{was not enough to}} justify revisiting the matter, meaning that the county will have to dismiss the application. Lee pointed out that at the original hearing, concerns had been raised that any tower higher than 650 ft would pose a safety hazard. County commissioners voted to appeal the decision. An appeals court upheld the ruling February 18, 2014. <b>A</b> month <b>later,</b> commissioners <b>voted</b> not to take further action.|$|R
5000|$|Darden's {{management}} {{responded with}} a much shorter presentation two days later. Without going into specifics, it conceded most of Starboard's critique was valid and {{that the company was}} already responding to those issues. It defended the unlimited breadsticks policy as [...] "conveying Italian hospitality" [...] and rebutted another claim the hedge fund had made: packaging for take-out food which the hedge fund had claimed was dishwasher-safe and thus needlessly expensive was in fact, merely microwave-safe. Nevertheless, <b>a</b> month <b>later</b> shareholders <b>voted</b> to replace the company's entire board of directors with Starboard's slate, an outcome described as an [...] "epic fail" [...] that happened very rarely.|$|R
50|$|The town {{began using}} it shortly afterwards, but it served mainly as {{a meeting place}} for the town board. Other offices were housed {{elsewhere}} in the town, often at the firehouse across the road and an office plaza downtown. In 2000 it {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places, and the town began to seriously consider renovating and expanding it. Some residents did not believe that was necessary, and helped defeat a $1.5 million expansion plan in a March 2001 <b>vote.</b> <b>A</b> <b>vote</b> <b>later</b> that year limited the town to $850,000 for any renovation or construction.|$|R
