40|$|Compared to ‘accident cases’, the {{attention}} to ‘occupational disease’ was not very much given {{in the field of}} industrial safety. In many instances, ‘disease’ cases were regarded as part of ‘accident’ cases. As such, the disease cases were included as part of the <b>accidents</b> <b>statistics</b> used in this country. The formal statistics shows that disease cases form {{only a small part of}} the overall claims. The rest are cases of accidents at the workplace or commuting accidents. Therefore, a question arose whether a rigid interpretation is given to the term ‘occupational disease’ similar to the meaning of accidents. Does that result in the small number of claims made by insurers? Further, how can we give a better opportunity for them to succeed in claims for occupational diseases? Should a separate platform be made available to ‘disease’ and ‘accident’ claims in order to give a better chance to succeed in disease claims? Are the claims permitted for the diseases listed in the Act only...|$|R

50|$|Referred to as {{assisted}} braking, or incorrectly as 'auto-locking', {{under the}} right conditions these devices use a sudden load on the rope to engage a camming mechanism (known as mechanically assisted breaking devices) or pull the belay carabiner into a pinch point (known as geometrically assisted breaking devices) to prevent the rope from passing through the belay device. Use of such belay devices should never be instructed as self- or auto-locking, but as assisted braking. There do exist rare conditions where these devices' braking functions may not apply correctly, though <b>accident</b> <b>statistics</b> show that these incidents are often user-error. An icy, muddy, worn, too-thin of a rope, or possibly other conditions, such as insufficient training and experience, may affect a device's braking function.|$|E
50|$|A {{misconception}} {{many people}} have is that retroreflectivity is only important during night-time travel. However, in recent years, more states and agencies require that headlights be turned on in inclement weather such as rain and snow. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA): Approximately 24% of all vehicle accidents occur during adverse weather (rain, sleet, snow and fog).

40|$|According to {{the road}} <b>accidents</b> <b>statistics</b> of Korea, 33 % of {{fatalities}} occurred in winter. As many factors can be {{the causes of the}} accidents in winter season, road freezing is the most important factor among them. Even though the road surface temperature is more important than air temperature, generally the drivers and road manager get the air temperature from the weather forecast. If a road manager has information or can predict the road surface condition or temperature, the accidents related with road surface freezing could be reduced. In this study, a thermal mapping system was developed to measure road surface temperatures. And the road surface temperature (RST) and air temperature were measured along the various road segmentations such as normal road sections, bridges, tunnels and cut slope sections. As a result, although the RST in normal paved road sections was higher than air temperature during night time, the RST in bridges and cut slope sections was lower than air temperature. Moreover, the average RST in bridges and cut slope sections showed lower values than in normal paved road sections. In this study, we suggest that significant attention is required in bridges and cut slope sections during winter. Keywords: Road Surface, Temperature, Road Weather, Winter Maintenanc...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} the problem of children´s presence in traffic, to explore the state of traffic education on basic schools and to show children´s knowledge. The introductory part of my thesis shows, that the <b>accidents</b> <b>statistics</b> are getting better, {{but there is still}} a place for their improvement. My surveys on basic schools also show that. Some basic schools even don´t have traffic education at all or only in a limited range. The thesis describes the state of traffic education from the Framework Education Programme for Elementary Education view. Traffic education doesn´t have big integration there these days. It´s only on the teachers, how they interpret the meaning of the requirements in individual subjects. So schools don´t have to take a big care about traffic education. Fortunately there will be a change in Framework Education Programme in the future. The traffic education will have more important role there. On the basis of the Framework Education Programme I have suggested some possibilities, how to integrate the traffic education in current school subjects. The survey among selected students of Teacher Training for Primary Schools also takes part. I wanted to explore, what is the students´ opinion about traffic education and show their preparedness for its teaching...|$|R
50|$|Model-by-model road <b>accident</b> <b>statistics</b> {{from the}} UK Department for Transport {{show that the}} Land Rover Defender {{is one of the}} safest cars on British roads as {{measured}} by chance of death in two-car injury accidents.The figures, which were based on data collected by police forces following accidents between 2000 and 2004 in Great Britain, showed that Defender drivers had a 1% chance of being killed or seriously injured and a 33% chance of sustaining any kind of injury. Other four-wheel-drive vehicles scored equally highly, and collectively these vehicles were much safer for their passengers than those in other classes such as passenger cars and MPVs. These figures reflect the fact that drivers of large mass vehicles are likely to be safer, often {{at the expense of other}} drivers if they collide with smaller cars.|$|E

5000|$|Accidents {{destroyed}} {{a third of}} all Lansens during 25 years of service, killing 100 crew along with 7 civilians in Vikbo. [...] The accidents were due to a combination of technical faults, the aircraft not being ready for service, and training deficiencies in regards to flying at night and in adverse weather. In the 1960 Vikbo crash, pilot Uno Magnusson's A 32A suffered an engine outage, and ejected before crashing into a farmhouse, killing all seven civilian occupants. The crash was due to a known fault which occurred when a drop tank was fitted; the J32 B had been forbidden from using the drop tank. [...] Replacement parts to correct the fault were available at the base but had not yet been fitted. The crash's causes were suppressed from the public by the Flygvapnet press office; as the victims were civilians, they were not included in official <b>accident</b> <b>statistics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aviation <b>accident</b> rate <b>statistics</b> are {{necessarily}} estimates.

40|$|According {{to general}} <b>accidents</b> <b>statistics</b> a coach {{is the safest}} means of {{transportation}} with respect to fatalities per billion traveller kilometers. Reasons for this include the existing regulations related to coach safety and the self regulation of the coach building industry. Most passive safety standards are, however, more related {{to the safety of}} the passengers and less to the safety of driver and courier. Their typical position {{at the front of the}} coach and the fact that most heavy structural parts of the coach are behind their position in the coach, make the driver and courier vulnerable in case of a frontal collision. The injury risk in specific frontal collisions can be reduced by applying crash technology within the front structure of the coach. By redesign and reorganising the structure and the packaging underneath the driver and courier, the kinetic energy developed in a typical coach-to-trailerback collision can be absorbed whilst maintaining a survival space for driver and courier. This paper describes the development of a procedure for improvement in the frontal crashworthiness of coaches. Starting with analyses of related accident data and heavy vehicle crash experience from truck testing, numerical simulation, component and full scale testing have been combined to create a new passive safety structural concept. The experience gained has since been used and is demonstrated in the design of a new coach...|$|R
40|$|European Conference of Psychology, Milan, Italie, 07 -/ 07 / 2015 - 10 / 07 / 2015 <b>Accidents</b> <b>statistics</b> {{show that}} older drivers are {{over-represented}} in intersection accidents, especially when turning left. Our study aims at better understanding how ageing affects the driving abilities of elderly drivers in this situation. Three groups of drivers, young (25 - 35 years), younger-old (60 - 69 years), and older-old (70 and more) {{took part in}} the study. The experiment consisted in two parts. Perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities were assessed in the first one. The second one took place on a driving simulator. Participants had to decide if they could perform a left turn at intersections. Traffic conditions were varied. Statistical analysis showed the classical age-related perceptual, cognitive and physical declines. With regard to driving performance, elderly drivers accepted fewer left-turns than younger drivers, but exhibited more risky behaviors, especially when traffic was complex. Two patterns emerged from correlations between test results and driving behavior. Driving performances of young people showed that both their cognitive and perceptual abilities correlated with driving performances, but not their motor abilities. As for elderly people, cognitive and motor abilities were connected to driving performance, but not their perceptual abilities. Regressions are being processed in order to detail the relationships between the different variables. Results will determine the most relevant predictors of risky behaviors among elderly drivers at intersections...|$|R
