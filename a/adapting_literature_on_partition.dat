40|$|A {{special case}} of an elegant result due to Anderson proves {{that the number of}} $(s,s+ 1) $-core {{partitions}} is finite and is given by the Catalan number $C_s$. Amdeberhan recently conjectured that the number of $(s,s+ 1) $-core partitions into distinct parts equals the Fibonacci number $F_{s+ 1 }$. We prove this conjecture by enumerating, more generally, $(s,ds- 1) $-core partitions into distinct parts. We do this by relating them to certain tuples of nested twin-free sets. As a by-product of our results, we obtain a bijection between partitions into distinct parts and partitions into odd parts, which preserves the perimeter (that is, the largest part plus the number of parts minus $ 1 $).

Many of the 51 million forcefully displaced people around the world are not welcomed with hospitality, and this loss of citizenship leads to the loss of livelihood, wellbeing, and can reinstate the very dangers they originally escaped from. Refuge Heterotopia is a research project exploring the possible ways of reinstating stability and citizenship for refugees as they begin their journey of resettlement at the New Lynn refugee reception centre where they go through a six week orientation programme upon arrival in New Zealand, in order to support their long-term integration into society.

The result is an architectural expression of refugee hospitality; a place of spatial liberation, restoring one’s sense of safety, security and autonomy.

The main objective {{of this paper is}} to show that using exact algorithms instead of heuristics yields significant load balance improvements with negligible increase in preprocessing time. We provide detailed pseudocodes of our algorithms so that our results can be easily reproduced. We start with a review of <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> chains-on-chains <b>partitioning</b> problem. We propose improvements on these algorithms as well as efficient implementation tips. We also introduce novel algorithms, which are asymptotically and runtime efficient. We experimented with data sets from two different applications: Sparse matrix computations and Direct volume rendering. Experiments showed that the proposed algorithms are 100 times faster than a single sparse-matrix vector multiplication for 64 -way decompositions on average. Experiments also verify that load balance can be significantly improved by using exact algorithms instead of heuristics.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} popular method of encoding chaotic time-series from physical experiments {{is the so-called}} threshold crossings technique, where one simply replaces the real valued data with symbolic data of relative positions to an arbitrary partition at discrete times. The implication has been that this symbolic encoding describes the original dynamical system. On the other hand, the <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> generating <b>partitions</b> of non-hyperbolic dynamical systems has shown that a good partition is non-trivial to find. It is believed that the generating partition of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system connects "primary tangencies", which are generally not simple lines as used by a threshold crossings. Therefore, we investigate consequences of using itineraries generated by a non-generating partition. We do most of our rigorous analysis using the tent map as a benchmark example, but show numerically that our results likely generalize. In summary, we find the misrepresentation of the dynamical system by "sample-path" symbolic dynamics of an arbitrary partition can be severe, including (sometimes extremely) diminished topological entropy, and {{a high degree of}} non-uniqueness.

To this aim, we propose a two-stage model, which consists of a low-resolution data model and a linkage model connecting the lowand the high-resolution data.

Some claim governments will set environmental policies that are too lax, while others claim that policies will be excessively tough (in order to spur firms to innovate). Both these claims relate to the possibility that governments may distort their environmental policies for strategic reasons, and to test these claims requires modelling environmental policy in a world of imperfect competition where there are strategic gains to governments trying to manipulate markets through their environmental policies, and to producers trying to manipulate markets through their R&D decisions. There is now a considerable <b>literature</b> which <b>adapts</b> the <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> strategic international trade to include environmental policy, but this literature suffers from some limitations. Most of the models consider the cases where either only governments act strategically or only producers act strategically. A proper analysis would allow for both sets of agents to act strategically.

40|$|While many recent {{international}} video coding standards, especially H. 264 /MPEG- 4 AVC, leverage {{block size}} adaptivity in motion estimation, the rate-distortion boundary can be pushed further by allowing even more {{freedom in the}} partitioning process of inter pictures. Adaptive-shape partitioning, which allows blocks to be partitioned along a straight line {{that runs through the}} block at a freely chosen angle and position, complements the regular subblock partitioning, allowing the encoder to better adapt to the local characteristics of the motion activity in a video sequence. However, the technique demands excessive encoder resources to exhaust the large search space. This paper is the result of an investigation into the relative rate-distortion importance of the various adaptive-shape modes, both in terms of the angle of the partition boundary and of its location within a block. We find that a significant reduction of the search space with a factor of up to 40 can be accomplished, while retaining 50 to 90 % of the compression gain obtained {{in the state of the}} art. This allows encoders to operate at much lower complexity levels and also reduces the signaling overhead associated with adaptive-shape <b>partitioning.</b> Based <b>on</b> our observations, we formulate a number of approaches to trade off compression performance against encoder complexity.

The <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> agency does not show how mediated efforts in a service learning course impact PTs who are working with students. However, research documents connections between agency and elements of service learning that have been identified as effective in the literature. For example, Ahearn’s [3] work relates to conceptualizations of agency related to language. Based on the way PTs and students interact, they co-construct meanings of the experience and of the learning of mathematics through the tutoring experience situated in a school context [3]. Felton and Koestler [22] examined the relationship between critical reflection and agency in mathematics education, highlighting the importance of PTs making informed decisions that supports students’ learning. This connection between critical reflection and agency is seen through the emphasis on acting for change in response to previous actions and established assumptions in education to improve student outcomes. Therefore, mentoring, shared learning [44], and mutual benefits [37] arise as they continue through the process. Swick [44] further suggests that when “teachers see themselves as builders of learning communities” (p. 263) the greatest impact of the experience on learners occurs.|$|R
