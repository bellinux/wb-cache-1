5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in <b>atomic</b> <b>radius,</b> {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E

40|$|<b>Atomic</b> <b>radii</b> of {{elements}} are experimentally obtained from crystallographic data. However, {{this is not}} a feasible approach for some elements with limited number of atoms in existence since radii could not be easily drawn from several types of bound in ionic, covalent and metallic crystals. Hence, this work employs artificial intelligence approach using support vector machine to accurately predict and estimate the <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> {{of elements}} in the periodic table in order to pave way for predicting <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> of elements that could not be easily determined from crystallographic data. We obtained an accuracy of over 99 % {{on the basis of the}} correlation between the experimental and our predicted radii.

5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} thallium, even though periodic trends would predict it to have an <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, but have been calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Atomic</b> <b>radii</b> vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each {{period of the}} table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end of}} each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{applying}} the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for calculating the electrostatic free energies of solute molecules, {{an open question}} is how to specify the boundary between the low-dielectric solute and the high-dielectric solvent. Two common specifications of the dielectric boundary, as the molecular surface (MS) or the van der Waals (vdW) surface of the solute, give very different results for the electrostatic free energy of the solute. With the same <b>atomic</b> <b>radii,</b> the solute is more solvent-exposed in the vdW specification. One way to resolve the difference is to use different sets of <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> for the two surfaces. The radii for the vdW surface would be larger in order to compensate for the higher solvent exposure. Here we show that radius reparametrization required for bringing MS-based and vdW-based PB results to agreement is solute-size dependent. The difference in <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> for individual amino acids as solutes is only 2 - 5 % but increases to over 20 % for proteins with 200 residues. Therefore two sets of radii that yield identical MS-based and vdW-based PB results for small solutes will give very different PB results for large solutes. This finding raises issues about two common practices. The first is the use of <b>atomic</b> <b>radii,</b> which are parametrized against either experimental solvation data or data obtained from explicit-solvent simulations on small compounds, for PB calculations on proteins. The second is the parametrization of vdW-based generalized Born models against MS-based PB results. I...|$|R
50|$|<b>Atomic</b> <b>radii</b> vary in a {{predictable}} and explicable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease rightward along each period (row) of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group (column). The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end}} of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|R
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing <b>atomic</b> <b>radius,</b> decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (element 58) to ytterbium (element 70), {{are not particularly}} effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> similar to niobium, and so forth. This {{is known as the}} lanthanide contraction. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect. The d-block contraction, which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{electron}} configuration of darmstadtium is calculated to be 6d87s2, which obeys the Aufbau principle {{and does not}} follow platinum's outer {{electron configuration}} of 5d96s1. This {{is due to the}} relativistic stabilization of the 7s2 electron pair over the whole seventh period, so that none of the elements from 104 to 112 are expected to have electron configurations violating the Aufbau principle. The <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> of darmstadtium is expected to be around 132pm.|$|E

50|$|The d-block {{contraction}} is less pronounced {{than the}} lanthanide contraction but arises {{from a similar}} cause. In this case, it is the poor shielding capacity of the 3d-electrons which affects the <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> and chemistries of the elements immediately following the first row of the transition metals, from gallium (Z = 31) to bromine (Z = 35).|$|R
5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden tinge that takes a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the <b>atomic</b> <b>radius,</b> which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized so it {{has only}} one electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.99 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like francium is 1.29 and the figure for hydrogen-like caesium is 1.091. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> to around 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm); the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260pm. The ionic radius of Uue+ {{is expected to be}} 180pm.|$|E

30|$|Substitution of {{nitrogen}} by oxygen {{is possible in}} principle, since both atoms have similar <b>atomic</b> <b>radii</b> [37]. At room temperature and up to 800 K, the heat of formation of crystalline In 2 O 3 (221 kcal/mol) {{is higher than the}} heat of formation of crystalline InN (34 kcal/mol) [37], and therefore, even in the presence of oxygen, InN is preferably formed.|$|R
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the <b>atomic</b> <b>radius,</b> and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} iodine {{are the highest}} among the halogens, {{conforming}} to the increasing trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the halogens. Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the halogens. Because it has the largest <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> among the halogens, iodine has the lowest first ionisation energy, lowest electron affinity, lowest electronegativity and lowest reactivity of the halogens.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in <b>atomic</b> <b>radius,</b> ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, lanthanum {{has the largest}} <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as calcium oxide. A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. Lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. Lanthanum is the strongest and hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an <b>atomic</b> <b>radius.</b> This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium {{should be}} a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.7g/cm3 in the solid state; in comparison, the most dense known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from copernicium's high atomic weight, the {{lanthanide}} and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough copernicium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. However, some calculations predict copernicium to be a gas at room temperature, the first gaseous metal in the periodic table (the second being flerovium), due to the closed-shell electron configurations of copernicium and flerovium. The <b>atomic</b> <b>radius</b> of copernicium {{is expected to be}} around 147pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
50|$|Sulfur {{has been}} known since antiquity, and oxygen was {{recognized}} as an element in the 18th century. Selenium, tellurium and polonium were discovered in the 19th century, and livermorium in 2000. All of the chalcogens have six valence electrons, leaving them two electrons short of a full outer shell. Their most common oxidation states are −2, +2, +4, and +6.

5|$|The ionic radii of the {{alkali metals}} are {{much smaller than}} their <b>atomic</b> <b>radii.</b> This is because the {{outermost}} electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller.
