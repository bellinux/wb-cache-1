5|$|Although known {{mostly for}} his work in black and white, Koppelman's painterly {{interest}} in color took a new form in the 1970s, when he began using color in his prints. After 1980, he worked increasingly in pastel <b>and</b> <b>watercolor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kurtzman, a cartoonist, {{created the}} series at the {{culmination}} of his career. He had launched Mad magazine, worked briefly for Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and {{on a series of}} solo and collaborative projects, then returned to working for Hefner with Little Annie Fanny. Each episode of the comic strip was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, <b>and</b> <b>watercolor</b> by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's full potential. The complete series was first collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics.|$|E

25|$|But Weston {{concluded}} that the working life was draining him of his creative energies. In 1920, {{with the help of}} some local carpenters, he built a one-room log cabin near St. Huberts, New York.

25|$|In 1896, Wright {{moved out}} of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly {{completed}} Steinway Hall Building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., Myron Hunt, and Dwight H. Perkins. These young architects, inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what would become known as the Prairie School. They were joined by Perkins apprentice, Marion Mahony, who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his presentation drawings <b>and</b> <b>watercolor</b> renderings. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois {{and one of the first}} licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.|$|E

500|$|The work is {{composed}} in ink, pencil, colored pencil, <b>and</b> <b>watercolor</b> {{on paper and}} measures [...] When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches, the University of Pennsylvania summarized the work as a [...] "bird's-eye {{view of the city}} from Ninth Avenue in a straight line westward, with space becoming ever more condensed..." [...] They also described the work as a tongue-in-cheek view of the world.

500|$|Clara Elsene Peck (April 18, 1883 – February 1968) was an American {{illustrator}} and painter {{known for}} her illustrations {{of women and children}} in the early 20th century. [...] Peck received her arts education from the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts and was employed as a magazine illustrator from 1906-1940. [...] Peck's body of work encompasses a wide range, from popular women's magazines and children's books, works of fiction, commercial art for products like Ivory soap, and comic books <b>and</b> <b>watercolor</b> painting later in her career. [...] Peck worked during the [...] "Golden Age of American Illustration" [...] (1880s-1930s) contemporaneous with noted female illustrators Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth Shippen Green and Violet Oakley.|$|E
500|$|Kurtzman {{recruited}} his long-time collaborator Will Elder {{to work on}} the strip's illustrations. He {{suggested to}} Elder an [...] "outlineless", painted style, then thought the strip would be better suited by an India inked, outlined comic book style with flat color behind it. Hefner, whose opinion prevailed, preferred the more difficult, fully painted, outlineless look. Kurtzman's suggestions for the feature's name included The Perils of Zelda, The Perils of Irma, and Little Mary Mixup; he settled on Little Annie Fanny, its title and logo a parody of Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie. The cartoonist began submitting story ideas for the multi-page comic strip to Hefner for approval. Over the twenty-six years he wrote the character, he was allowed (with Playboy substantial budget) to travel for research, photography, and sketching. He followed this with a preliminary script for Hefner, who revised it. Kurtzman then worked out the story's composition, pacing, and action in thumbnail drawings and pencil roughs of each page of the comic, followed by larger, more-detailed layouts on translucent vellum specifying lighting, color, and speech balloon placement. These also required Hefner's approval—a typical two- to seven-page episode would take as many as nine pages of layout. Kurtzman then discussed the layout with Elder, who drove from his home in New Jersey to Kurtzman's in New York. Kurtzman acted out every detail of the strip; according to Elder, [...] "He would change his voice and take on the characteristics of each role... We'd crack each other up and fall down laughing." [...] This gave Elder what he needed to create the penciling, including [...] "eye pops" [...] (background gags worked into blank areas of Kurtzman's layout; Hefner rejected many, so Elder created as many as possible) and the final rendering. Elder painted in oil, tempera, <b>and</b> <b>watercolor,</b> never using ink. Beginning with a white illustration board, Elder explained he would [...] "pile on" [...] his oil paint, light colors over dark, then apply tempera, then layer several watercolor washes to give Annie luminous tones. [...] "The colors were like gems to me," [...] he said. [...] "I worked very hard to give them iridescence." [...] The work was labor-intensive and deadlines were often difficult to meet, so other artists, including Russ Heath, Arnold Roth, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, Frank Frazetta, and Paul Coker, were occasionally enlisted to help finish the art. Jaffee, a childhood friend of Elder, said about the experience: [...] "Little Annie Fannie was the most unique, lavishly produced cartoon cum illustration feature ever. Each panel was a miniature masterpiece that Willie glazed and re-glazed in brilliant watercolor until he reached the level of 3-D-like translucence that he wanted. I know from first-hand experience what went into this project." [...] Letterers inked the dialog balloons before Kurtzman cleaned and submitted the finished work. Little Annie Fanny, [...] first comic strip, was the first multi-page comics feature in a major American magazine.|$|E

2500|$|Mary Agnes Yerkes, ( [...] August 9, 1886 – November 8, 1989), was an American Impressionist painter, {{photographer}} and artisan.
