5|$|After {{conversion}} to M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyers, the battalion moved into Germany, helping force a bridgehead over the Neckar River at the Battle of Heilbronn. After reaching Stuttgart it was reassigned to the 103rd Infantry Division, {{and with them}} reached Innsbruck in Austria by VE Day. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of occupation duties it was ordered to prepare for service in the Pacific; however, while it was reforming in the United States, the Japanese surrender was announced, {{and the need for}} more combat units ended. The battalion was demobilized in September 1945.|$|E
5|$|After her Navy service {{ended in}} 1919, she was {{returned}} to her original owners, who, at least once, chartered her to another shipping company. In May 1922, Iowan rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line steamer Welsh Prince in the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon, killing seven men in the process. In June 1941, Iowan ran aground on a reef near Point Conception, California, and suffered $500,000 in damages while buffeted by waves on the reef. She was freed from the reef <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> towed to Los Angeles, and repaired.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> in Leipzig, {{before the}} second week of January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|Decisions {{made during}} the next two days had a {{dramatic}} impact on the experience of Air Group 18 at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. TG 38.1 was detached and sent to Ulithi for replenishment and rearmament <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of continuous operations against Okinawa and the Ryukyus Islands. USS Bunker Hill and Hancock were also detached from TG 38.2 at this time, leaving Intrepid the sole Essex-class aircraft carrier in its group. When Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force was sighted entering the Sibuyan Sea on October 24, the only task group readily available to strike was the shorthanded TG 38.2.|$|E

Bakshi and Crumb were unable {{to reach an agreement}} <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of negotiations but Krantz secured the film rights from Crumb's wife, Dana, who had a power of attorney. Crumb received $50,000, distributed over the course of production and ten percent of Krantz's proceeds.|$|E

The 38th CPV Field Army sent heavy assaults against the South Korean forces guarding Hill 395 in the Battle of White Horse. At the same time, Chinese forces attacked Arrowhead Hill, {{which was held}} by the 2nd Infantry Division two miles away. Both hills changed hands several times, but <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> and almost 10,000 casualties, the Chinese were unsuccessful in capturing either objective and withdrew.|$|E

Young males are at first nomadic, jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12–15 years; in captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived cats.|$|E
5|$|While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> in the hospital, Zimmermann {{became his}} {{full-time}} caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they went. After the stroke, Cagney {{was no longer}} able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} the Danish consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp {{on the island of}} Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> they were {{evacuated}} to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become King Alexander I, offered them a permanent home there, but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark. The Grand Duchess complied, and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920. They lived with Kulikovsky's mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvidøre. Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along; he was resentful of his wife acting as Marie's secretary and companion, and Marie was distant toward him.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> in Haiko, {{the family}} moved to a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and the heir to the dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E

However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E
5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the concept}} phase {{there were four}} people working on the Hitman Go. Initial prototypes were built on paper using printed out characters.

Daniel Lutz served as creative director, and the team size peaked at eleven people throughout {{the remainder of the}} game's development. The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a low barrier of entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial working prototype and a basic level editor were developed in a few days and <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E
