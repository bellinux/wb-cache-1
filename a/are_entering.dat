5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead and many of the rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book A Whole New Mind, repeating {{arguments}} posed {{throughout the}} 20th century, argues that we <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> {{a new age}} where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this conceptual age, {{we will need to}} foster and encourage right-directed thinking (representing creativity and emotion) over left-directed thinking (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.|$|E

25|$|Where {{the doorway}} is wide enough, many Ashkenazi Jews tilt the mezuzah {{so that the}} top slants toward the room into which the door opens.

25|$|Ancient Egypt {{at the end}} of its New Kingdom {{period is}} {{experiencing}} adversities. The deserts are eroding Egypt's arable land. The country's population has declined from eight to six million. Foreign peoples <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> Egypt in ever-growing numbers, undermining its unity. The chasm between the peasants and craftsmen on one hand, and the ruling classes on the other, is growing, exacerbated by the ruling elites' fondness for luxury and idleness. The country is becoming ever more deeply indebted to Phoenician merchants, as imported goods destroy native industries.|$|E

25|$|Salinity {{is another}} {{important}} water quality issue. Drainage return flows to the Nile result {{in an increase in}} salinity of the water from 250 ppm (mg/l) at Aswan to 2,700 ppm at the Delta barrages. However, more salts are being discharged into the Mediterranean Sea than <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> at Aswan (see Irrigation for agriculture in Egypt) so {{that in the long run}} the salinity of the water at the Delta barrages could decrease. However, saline groundwater of marine origin enters the Delta through pumping of brackish water and upwelling in lakes and drains, thus counterbalancing this effect.|$|E
25|$|One shift {{caused by}} multi-literate environments is that private-sphere texts {{are being made}} more public. The private sphere is {{described}} as {{an environment in which}} people have a sense of personal authority and are distanced from institutions, such as the government. The family and home are considered {{to be a part of}} the private sphere. Family photographs are an example of multimodality in this sphere. Families take pictures (sometimes captioning them) and compile them in albums that are generally meant to be displayed to other family members or audiences that the family allows. These once private albums <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> the public environment of the Internet more often due to the rapid development and adoption of technology.|$|E
