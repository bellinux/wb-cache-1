50|$|This {{species is}} {{often found in}} arid and semiarid, rocky or stony, shrub or scrub covered foothills at {{elevations}} up to about 3000 m above sea level. This is also the westernmost species of <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobra.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{subspecies}} {{possesses the}} most toxic venom of the C. oreganus / C. viridis group, {{although there is}} apparently considerable variability among local populations (Glenn and Straight, 1977, 1978). It is {{even one of the}} most potent venoms found in North America (Glenn and Straight, 1977), and according to LD50 studies the venom is many times more potent than that of an <b>Asiatic</b> <b>Cobra.</b> [...] It is characterized by the presence of a presynaptic neurotoxin, referred to as concolor toxin, the amount of which varies in individual snakes (Glenn and Straight, 1977, 1990; Wetstein et al., 1985).|$|E
40|$|Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} The seed, {{leaf and}} root of Mucuna pruriens {{have been used}} in traditional medicine for treatments of various diseases. In Nigeria, the seed is used as oral prophylactics for snakebite. Aim of the study To study the protective effects of Mucuna pruriens seed extract against the lethalities of various snake venoms. Materials and methods Rats were pre-treated with Mucuna pruriens seed extract and challenged with various snake venoms. The effectiveness of anti-Mucuna pruriens (anti-MPE) antibody to neutralize the lethalities of snake venoms was investigated by in vitro neutralization. Results In rats, MPE pre-treatment conferred effective protection against lethality of Naja sputatrix venom and moderate protection against Calloselasma rhodostoma venom. Indirect ELISA and immunoblotting studies showed that there were extensive cross-reactions between anti-MPE IgG and venoms from many different genera of poisonous snakes, suggesting the involvement of immunological neutralization in the protective effect of MPE pre-treatment against snake venom poisoning. In vitro neutralization experiments showed that the anti-MPE antibodies effectively neutralized the lethalities of <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobra</b> (Naja) venoms, but were not very effective against other venoms tested. Conclusions The anti-MPE antibodies could be used in the antiserum therapy of <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobra</b> (Naja) bites...|$|E
50|$|Wallach et al. {{suggested}} {{recognition of}} four subgenera within Naja: Naja for the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobras,</b> Boulengerina for the African forest, water and burrowing cobras, Uraeus for the Egyptian and Cape cobra group and Afronaja for the African spitting cobras.|$|R
5000|$|The Indian cobra is {{classified}} under the genus Naja {{of the family}} Elapidae. The genus was first described by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. The species Naja naja was first described by the Swedish physician, zoologist, and botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus Naja was split into several subgenera based on various factors, including morphology, diet, and habitat. Naja naja {{is part of the}} subgenus Naja, along with all the other species <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobras,</b> including Naja kaouthia, Naja siamensis, Naja sputatrix, and the rest. Naja naja is considered to be the prototypical cobra species within the Naja subgenus, and within the entire Naja genus. All Asiatic species of Naja were considered conspecific with Naja naja until the 1990s, often as subspecies thereof. Many of the subspecies were later found to be artificial or composites. This causes much potential confusion when interpreting older literature.|$|R
5000|$|Like other cobra species, this snake {{possesses}} postsynaptic neurotoxic venom. The venom {{may also}} consist of cardiotoxins and cytotoxins. The venom of the Equatorial spitting cobra exhibited the common characteristic enzymatic activities of <b>Asiatic</b> spitting <b>cobra</b> venoms: low protease, phosphodiesterase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase and L-amino-acid oxidase activities, moderately high acetylcholinesterase and hyaluronidase activities and high phospholipase A2. Cardiotoxins represented 40% of the snakes venom protein. This species presented an IV [...] of 0.50 µg/g mouse.|$|R
40|$|The lethal and enzymatic {{activities}} of venom from Naja sumatrana (Equatorial spitting cobra) were determined and compared to venoms from three other Southeast Asian cobras (Naja sputatrix, Naja siamensis and Naja kaouthia). All four venoms exhibited the common characteristic {{enzymatic activities}} of <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobra</b> venoms: low protease, phosphodiesterase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase and L-amino acid oxidase activities, moderately high acetylcholinesterase and hyaluronidase activities and high phospholipase A 2. Fractionation of N. sumatrana venom by Resource® S cation exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, USA) yielded nine major protein peaks, with all except the acidic protein peak being lethal to mice. Most of the protein peaks exhibit enzymatic activities, and L-amino acid oxidase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, acetylcholinesterase, 5 '-nucleotidase and hyaluronidase exist in multiple forms. Comparison of the Resource® S chromatograms {{of the four}} cobra venoms clearly indicates that the protein composition of N. sumatrana venom is distinct from venoms {{of the other two}} spitting cobras, N. sputatrix (Javan spitting cobra) and N. siamensis (Indochinese spitting cobra). The results support the revised systematics of the <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobra</b> based on multivariate analysis of morphological characters. The three spitting cobra venoms exhibit two common features: the presence of basic, potentially pharmacologically active phospholipases A 2 and a high content of polypeptide cardiotoxin, suggesting that the pathophysiological actions of the three spitting cobra venoms may be similar...|$|E
40|$|Snake venom is {{a complex}} {{polygenic}} trait driven by selection and is reflective of local adaptation of snakes to different ecological niches. The advent in –omics technologies has greatly improved the profiling of snake venom compositions, thereby providing a solid platform for investigating the mechanistic details underlying the evolutionary process of venom variability. Applying a venomic approach that integrates reversed-phase HPLC, gel-electrophoresis and nano-ESI-LCMS/MS, we profiled and compared the venoms of three <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobra</b> species sourced from different geographical localities of their native distribution (Naja naja: Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka; Naja kaouthia: Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam; Naja sumatrana: Thailand, northern and southern Malaysia, Sumatran Indonesia). Variations in venom composition are evident at intra-generic and intra-specific levels for all three cobra species, particularly on the expression of key toxins, i. e. alpha-neurotoxins and cytotoxins that are essential for predation and digestion. Of note, the Pakistani N. naja, Thai N. kaouthia and Indonesian N. sumatrana possess the highest content of neurotoxins (20 - 50...|$|E
2500|$|Many elapids are {{potentially}} deadly venomous snakes. Their venom is mainly neurotoxic, {{although many of}} them also possess several other types of toxins, including cardiotoxins and cytotoxins. This family has some members {{considered to be the}} world's most venomous land snakes based on the murine [...] of their venom, such as the inland taipan. Additionally, some large-sized elapids, such as the <b>Asiatic</b> king <b>cobra,</b> African black mamba, forest cobra, and Australasian coastal taipan, can inject a large quantity of venom during envenomation.|$|R
40|$|Background: Snake {{envenomation}} is {{a serious}} public health threat {{in the rural areas}} of Asian and African countries. To date, the only proven treatment for snake envenomation is antivenom therapy. Cross-neutralization of heterologous venoms by antivenom raised against venoms of closely related species has been reported. The present study examined the cross neutralizing potential of a newly developed polyvalent antivenom, termed Neuro Polyvalent Snake Antivenom (NPAV). NPAV was produced by immunization against 4 Thai elapid venoms. Principal Findings: In vitro neutralization study using mice showed that NPAV was able to neutralize effectively the lethality of venoms of most common <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobras</b> (Naja spp.), Ophiophagus hannah and kraits (Bungarus spp.) from Southeast Asia, but only moderately to weakly effective against venoms of Naja from India subcontinent and Africa. Studies with several venoms showed that the in vivo neutralization potency of the NPAV was comparable to the in vitro neutralization potency. NPAV could also fully protect against N. sputatrix venom-induced cardio-respiratory depressant and neuromuscular blocking effects in anesthetized rats, demonstrating that the NPAV could neutralize most of the major lethal toxins in the Naja venom. Conclusions/Significance: The newly developed polyvalent antivenom NPAV may find potential application in the treatment of elapid bites in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, a neighboring nation of Thailand. Nevertheless, th...|$|R
50|$|The bite of {{this species}} may cause severe pain and swelling, along with severe neurotoxicity. Weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, hypotension, and {{paralysis}} of throat and limbs may appear in less than one hour after the bite. Without medical treatment, symptoms rapidly worsen and death can occur soon after a bite due to respiratory failure. A woman bitten by this species in northwestern Pakistan suffered severe neurotoxicity and died while {{en route to the}} closest hospital nearly 50 minutes after envenomation. Between 1979 and 1987, 136 confirmed bites were attributed to this species in the former Soviet Union. Of the 136, 121 received antivenom, and only 8 died. Of the 15 who did not receive antivenom, 11 died - a 73% mortality rate. Antivenom is not as effective for envenomation by this species as it is for other <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobras</b> within the same region, like the Indian cobra (Naja naja), and massive amounts of antivenom are often required for patients. As a result, a monovalent antivenom serum is being developed by the Razi Serum and Vaccine Research Institute in Iran. The untreated mortality rate for this species is approximately 70-75%, which is among the highest of all cobra species of the genus Naja. In both Central Asia and Iran this species is responsible for high rates of snakebites and resulting mortality.|$|R
50|$|Mulga snakes are large, venomous snakes {{growing up}} to 2.5 to 3.0 m in length {{in the largest}} specimens, {{although}} 1.5 m is a more typical length for an average adult. It is exceeded in length among venomous snakes only by the <b>Asiatic</b> king <b>cobra,</b> some species of African mambas, genus Lachesis (bushmasters) of the American neotropics, and the Australian taipan. A good-sized adult mulga snake of 2.0 to 2.5 m length can weigh 3 to 6 kg, and mulga snakes are often heavier than the co-occurring taipans. The colour of the snakes differs from area to area within their range; {{they can be a}} light brown colour in the desert to a dark, brown-blackish colour in the cooler regions of Queensland, South Australia, and New South Wales. This snake is robust, with a wide head and smooth snout.|$|R
50|$|Coastal taipans {{are large}} snakes. It {{is the longest}} venomous snake in Australia. Adult {{specimens}} of this species typically attains sexual maturity around 1.2 m in total length (body + tail). More mature specimens can grow to between 1.5 and 2.0 m. Other taipans, including the inland taipan, attain broadly similar sizes although {{they tend to be}} slightly smaller in average size. A specimen of an average 2 m total length weighs around 3 kg. According to the Queensland Museum, the longest recorded total length for the coastal taipan was a specimen that was 2.9 m and weighed 6.5 kg. However, though exceptionally rare, much larger specimens are widely believed to exist, including specimens of as much as 3.3 m. The taipan is exceeded in length among venomous snakes only by the <b>Asiatic</b> king <b>cobra,</b> African black mamba and genus Lachesis (bushmasters) of the American neotropics.|$|R
5000|$|Many factors {{influence}} {{the differences in}} cases of fatality among different species within the same genus. Among cobras, the cases of fatal outcome of bites in both treated and untreated victims can be quite large. For example, mortality rates among untreated cases of envenomation by the cobras as a whole group ranges from 6.5-10% for N kaouthia. [...] to about 70% for N. oxiana. Mortality rate for Naja atra is between 15 and 20%, 5-10% for N. nigricollis, 50% for N. nivea, 65-70% for N. melanoleuca, 20-25% for N. naja, and 50-60% for N. samarensis. In cases where victims of cobra bites are medically treated using normal treatment protocol for elapid type envenomation, differences in prognosis depend on the cobra species involved. The vast majority of envenomated patients treated make quick and complete recoveries, while other envenomated patients who receive similar treatment result in fatalities. The most important factors in the difference of mortality rates among victims envenomated by cobras is {{the severity of the}} bite and which cobra species caused the envenomation. The Caspian cobra (N. oxiana) and the Philippine cobra (N. philippinensis) are the two cobra species with the most toxic venoms based on [...] studies on mice. Both species cause prominent neurotoxicity and progression of life-threatening symptoms following envenomation. Death has been reported in as little as 30 minutes in cases of envenomation by both species. N. philippinensiss purely neurotoxic venom causes prominent neurotoxicity with minimal local tissue damage and pain and patients respond very well to antivenom therapy if treatment is administered rapidly after envenomation. Envenomation caused by N. oxiana is much more complicated. In addition to prominent neurotoxicity, very potent cytotoxic and cardiotoxic components are in this species venom. Local effects are marked and manifest in all cases of envenomation - severe pain, severe swelling, bruising, blistering, and tissue necrosis. Renal damage and cardiotoxicity are also clinical manifestations of envenomation caused by N. oxiana, though they are rare and secondary. The untreated mortality rate among those envenomed by N. oxiana approaches 80%, the highest among all species within the genus Naja. Antivenom is not as effective for envenomation by this species as it is for other <b>Asiatic</b> <b>cobras</b> within the same region, like the Indian cobra (N. naja) and due to the dangerous toxicity of this species venom, massive amounts of antivenom are often required for patients. As a result, a monovalent antivenom serum is being developed by the Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute in Iran. Response to treatment with antivenom is generally poor among patients, so mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation is required. As a result, mortality among those treated for N. oxiana envenomation is still relatively high (up to 30%) compared to all other species of cobra (<1%).|$|R
