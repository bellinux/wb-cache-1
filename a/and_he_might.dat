25|$|The boss of a clan is {{typically}} {{elected by the}} rank-and-file soldiers (though violent successions do happen). Due to {{the small size of}} most Sicilian clans, the boss of a clan has intimate contact with all members, and doesn't receive {{much in the way of}} privileges or rewards as he would in larger organizations (such as the larger Five Families of New York). His tenure is also frequently short: elections are yearly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be deposed sooner for misconduct or incompetence.|$|E

Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold – as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) – he retained his passion for life in all forms.

25|$|On {{the fictional}} Inkwell Isle, Cuphead {{and his brother}} Mugman are two fun-loving kids who live {{under the watchful eye}} of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the {{brothers}} wander into the Devil's Casino and play craps. When the brothers go on a winning streak, the casino's manager King Dice calls upon the Devil, who raises the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win another time, they will own the entire casino; if not, the Devil will have their souls. Cuphead rolls snake eyes and he and Mugman must give up their souls. The brothers beg for mercy, so the Devil makes a deal with them: collect the contracts of other inhabitants of Inkwell Isle who have lost their souls by midnight the next day, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> let them off the hook. They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest.|$|E
25|$|The {{married couple}} formed a single unit {{in terms of}} {{external}} responsibility, especially for debt. The man was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her marriage, {{as well as for}} his own; but he could use her as a mancipium (see above). Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage contract, that the wife should not be seized for her husband's pre-nuptial debts; but stipulated that then he was not responsible for her pre-nuptial debts, and, in any case, that both together were responsible for all debts contracted after marriage. A man might make his wife a settlement by deed of gift, which gave her a life interest in part of his property, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a favorite child; but she could in no case leave it to her family. Although married, she always remained a member of her father's house—she is rarely named wife of A, but usually daughter of B, or mother of C.|$|E
25|$|Amlaíb and Ragnall {{ruled in}} York until 944. The dating {{of events in}} period between the death of Æthelstan and the {{expulsion}} of Amlaíb and Ragnall is uncertain as the various versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle are in conflict. It appears that after Æthelstan's death, not only did Edmund lose control of Northumbria, but that the Five Burghs of the Mercian Danelaw also pledged themselves to Amlaíb mac Gofrith. One of the Amlaíbs stormed Tamworth according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle:Here Olaf broke down Tamworth and a great slaughter fell on either side, and the Danes had the victory and led much war-booty away with them. Wulfrun was seized in the raid. Here King Edmund besieged King Olaf and Archbishop Wulfstan in Leicester, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have controlled them had they not escaped from the stronghold in the night. It is not clear when in the period between 940 and 943 these events took place, {{and as a result}} historians disagree as to whether they concern Amlaíb mac Gofrith or Amlaíb Cuarán.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was en-route to Campbeltown Airport in Argyll, Scotland, {{to pick up}} a ten year-old boy with acute abdominal pain, suspected to be appendicitis. After a flight that included many navigational irregularities, the pilot was flying the normal approach, which took the aircraft out to sea before turning back toward the airport. The pilot informed controllers that he had completed the turn, {{and that was the last}} transmission received from the aircraft. Investigators conclude the aircraft hit the water a few seconds after that transmission. Both occupants of the aircraft, the pilot and a paramedic seated at his station behind the pilot, were killed. The ensuing investigation concluded that the pilot allowed the aircraft to fly too low, and it descended unchecked into the sea. The pilot was also fatigued, overworked, lacked recent flying practise, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have suffered from an undetermined influence, such as disorientation, distraction, or subtle incapacitation, as evidenced by several navigational errors, miscommunications, and mismanagement of his instruments. Although the weather might have precluded a safe landing in Campbeltown, the weather was not a cause of the accident. The patient was eventually driven overland to a Glasgow hospital, where he was treated for a ruptured appendix.|$|E

500|$|Fischer {{associated}} with the Worldwide Church of God in the mid-1960s. The church prescribed Saturday Sabbath, and forbade work (and competitive chess) on Sabbath.

During the mid 1970s Fischer contributed significant money to the Worldwide Church of God. In 1972 one journalist stated that [...] "Fischer is almost as serious about religion as he is about chess", and the champion credited his faith with greatly improving his chess. Yet, prophecies by Herbert W. Armstrong went unfulfilled, and the church was rocked by revelations of a series of sex scandals involving Garner Ted Armstrong.

The scan revealed no knee ligament damage had occurred and it was estimated he would be injured for a month. He returned to training in November 2010, having {{been out of the}} team injured for almost three months, returning as an 87th-minute substitute in a 3–0 home win over League Two team Rotherham United in an FA Cup first round replay on 17 November. He scored at home for the first time for York with the 85th-minute winner against Forest Green on 22 January 2011, the goal being a drilled shot into the bottom corner. Mackin finished the season with 13 appearances and 1 goal before being released by York in June 2011 after being told he could find another club.|$|E

500|$|Athletic {{authorities}} {{argued that}} Ward should not play {{because it would}} be discourteous to Georgia Tech, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be injured. [...] There was fear that if Ward played, he would be injured by malicious blows after the play had ended. [...] Playwright Arthur Miller, then a writer for Michigan’s student newspaper, learned first-hand about the strong resistance among the Georgia Tech team to playing on the same field with an African-American athlete. In his biography of Miller, Enoch Brater noted that Miller had friends from Arkansas who knew one of the Georgia Tech players. Brater described Miller’s involvement this way: “Remmel [...] took Miller with them to meet with members of the team, to protest but also to appeal to the athletes' sense of fair play. ‘Miller was {{right in the middle of}} this’, Remmel recalls. Not only did the visiting team rebuff ‘the Yankee’ Miller ‘in salty language’, but they told him they would actually kill Ward if he set one foot on the Michigan gridiron. [...] ‘The Georgia Tech team was wild.’ [...] Miller was furious. He ‘went immediately to the office of the Michigan Daily and wrote an article about it, but it was not published.’ [...] [...] [...] Remmel said that Miller ‘could not believe that the Georgia Tech team would have tried to destroy Willis Ward—but, I am sure they would have.’” ...|$|E
500|$|One {{manuscript}} of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that, following the victory at Hatfield Chase, Cadwallon and Penda {{went on to}} ravage [...] "the whole land" [...] of the Northumbrians. Certainly Cadwallon continued the war, but the extent of Penda's further participation is uncertain. Bede says that the pagans who had slain Edwin—presumably {{a reference to the}} Mercians under Penda, although conceivably it could be a derisive misnomer meant to refer to the Christian British—burned a church and town at Campodonum, although the time at which this occurred is uncertain. Penda might have withdrawn from the war at some point before the defeat and death of Cadwallon at the Battle of Heavenfield, about a year after Hatfield Chase, since he was not present at this battle. Furthermore, Bede makes no mention of Penda's presence in the preceding siege and battle in which Osric of Deira was defeated and killed. Penda's successful participation in the battle of Hatfield Chase would have elevated his status among the Mercians and so enabled him to become king, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have withdrawn from the war before Heavenfield to secure or consolidate his position in Mercia. Referring to Penda's successes against the West Saxons and the Northumbrians, D. P. Kirby writes of Penda's emergence in these years as [...] "a Mercian leader whose military exploits far transcended those of his obscure predecessors." ...|$|E
