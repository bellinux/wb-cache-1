5|$|The Analytical Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public {{as well as to}} simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public.

5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a bridge to the major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded {{that there were more}} pressing needs on the islands' road network, so {{they did not want to}} prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of the unrest, Ottawa sent three emissaries to the Red River, {{including}} HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith. While {{they were}} en route, the Métis National Committee declared a provisional government on 8 December, with Riel becoming its president on 27 December. Meetings between Riel and the Ottawa delegation {{took place on}} 5 and 6 January 1870, but when these proved fruitless, Smith chose to present his case in <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum.</b> Smith assured large audiences of the Government's goodwill in meetings on 19 and 20 January, leading Riel to propose {{the formation of a}} new convention split evenly between French and English settlers to consider Smith's instructions. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis. The provisional government established by Louis Riel published its own newspaper titled New Nation and established the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia to pass laws.|$|E

25|$|With {{the shift}} in {{shopping}} from publicly owned Main Streets to privately held shopping malls, the question of access to malls, and their shoppers, as <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> has been an issue raised nationwide. This issue has become particularly relevant in New Jersey, where malls in both suburban and exurban areas have largely supplanted local downtown districts as shopping destinations, depriving individuals and organizations of a public location {{to reach out to}} neighbors for distribution of fliers and other forms of expression. While different conclusions have been reached elsewhere, New Jersey's approach {{has been one of the}} most expansive in providing groups with access to malls as <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum,</b> despite their private ownership.|$|E
25|$|In January 1519, at Altenburg in Saxony, {{the papal}} nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach. Luther made certain {{concessions}} to the Saxon, who was a relative of the Elector, and promised to remain silent if his opponents did. The theologian Johann Eck, however, was determined to expose Luther's doctrine in <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum.</b> In June and July 1519, he staged a disputation with Luther's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{criticism}} {{and the public}} response to it indicate a deepening level of dissent, not only within the kingdom's religious establishment, but also among the public.

Similar questions of legitimacy will arise in coming months, with the kingdom's religious, political and perhaps military leaderships becoming the focal points for increasingly intense criticism.|$|E

As plans leaked, a local coalition formed among Miami’s grassroots activists protesting any commercial development and asking for a complete restoration and re-opening of Miami’s largest park and only public park on the Atlantic Ocean. The leadership at City Hall appointed an official community-based civil rights task force to provide <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> for the park’s future.|$|E
25|$|Network effect {{relates to}} the {{intellectual}} commons in a positive way. Through P2P networks users are able to share their intellectual property {{in a way that}} can benefit society as a whole.The sharing of intellectual property ultimately relates to economic growth due to the ability for creators to share information and still possibly benefit financially from it. Through P2P networks people are able to share types of education like scholarly articles, becoming a new form of public commons. Network externality like Ted.com {{is an example of how}} intellectual commons with the use of network externality benefits society as a whole. Those who present intellectual property at Ted conferences are sharing their education on <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> that benefits whoever will listen. Therefore, the larger Ted.com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common-pool resources.|$|E
25|$|Mission San Jose's Lincoln-Douglas Debate team (also {{known as}} OHSODEF) is a nationally renowned program - in 2004-2005, {{the team was}} ranked first in the country. Notable accomplishments for the team include winning the National Tournament of Champions in 2003 and closing out (having two debaters meet {{in the final round}} of) the 2004 Fall Classic tournament at the Greenhill School. From 2007 to 2009, the Speech and Debate club was suspended. However, by the 2010-2011 school year the team regained its footing, {{qualifying}} three students for the California State tournament and qualifying three students for the NFL National tournament in speech events. As of 2010-2011, the debate team had bounced back to have close to 110 members, with multiple varsity members reaching elimination rounds at regional invitational tournaments and the addition of <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> division in 2011.

25|$|Interestingly, Bernstein {{left the}} party {{during the first}} world war, as did Karl Kautsky, who had played an {{important}} role as the leading Marxist theoretician and editor of the theoretical journal of SPD, “Die Neue Zeit”. Neither joined the Communist party after the war; they both came back to the SPD in the early Twenties. From 1915 on theoretical discussions within the SPD were dominated by a group of former anti-revisionist Marxists, who tried to legitimize the support of the First World War by the German SPD group in the Reichstag with Marxist arguments. Instead of the class struggle they proclaimed the struggle of peoples and developed much of the rhetoric later used by Nazi propaganda (“Volksgemeinschaft” etc.). The group was led by Heinrich Cunow, Paul Lensch and Konrad Haenisch (“Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch-Gruppe”) and was close to the Russian-German revolutionary and social scientist Parvus, who gave <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> to the group with his journal “Die Glocke”. From the teachings of Kurt Schumacher and Professor Johann Plenge, there is a link to the current right-wing “Seeheimer Kreis” within the SPD founded by Annemarie Renger, Schumacher's former secretary.|$|E
25|$|Also of {{interest}} is the Governor's Mansion State Historic Park, a large Victorian Mansion which was home to 13 of California's Governors, {{as well as the}} official residence for current governor Jerry Brown following renovations in 2015.

Guided public tours are available. The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts, home of the California Hall of Fame, is a cultural destination dedicated to telling the rich history of California and its unique influence on the world of ideas, innovation, art and culture. The museum educates tens of thousands of school children through inspiring programs, sharing with world visitors California's rich art, history and cultural legacy through dynamic exhibits, and serving as <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> and international meeting place. The California State Railroad Museum in Old Sacramento has historical exhibits and live steam locomotives that patrons may ride. The California Automobile Museum, located just south of Old Sacramento, is filled with automotive history and vehicles from 1880 to 2006 and is the oldest non-profit automotive museum in the West. The mission of it is to preserve, promote, and teach automotive culture and its influence on our lives—past, present and future. In addition, the Sacramento History Museum, in the heart of Old Sacramento, focuses on the history of Sacramento from the region's pre-Gold Rush history through the present day.|$|E
25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>forum.</b> Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E
