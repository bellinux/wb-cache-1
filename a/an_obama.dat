25|$|At {{the end of}} March 2008, Obama {{became the}} first {{candidate}} to open a double-digit lead in his national Gallup daily tracking poll results since Super Tuesday, when his competitor Hillary Clinton had a similar margin.

Another late-March poll found Obama maintaining his positive rating and limiting his negative rating better than his chief rival, Clinton. The NBC News and Wall Street Journal poll showed Obama losing two points of positive rating and gaining four points of negative rating, while Clinton lost eight points of positive rating and gained five points of negative rating. A Newsweek poll taken on April 16–17 showed Obama leading Clinton 54 to 35 percent among Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters. The Gallup daily tracking poll showed Obama's lead over Clinton in the same group peaking at 51 to 40 percent on April 14 (results based on interviews April 11–13), then closing, and on April 19 (results based on interviews April 16–18) Clinton gained a lead of 46 to 45 percent, the first time Obama had not led since March 18–20.

500|$|The article {{begins by}} recounting a 1995 meeting between Preckwinkle and Obama {{in which he}} {{discussed}} a possible run for the Illinois Senate seat then held by Alice Palmer.

[...] In 1995, she successfully challenged the signatures of Obama's opponents in the Democratic Primary for the Illinois Senate, allowing Obama to run unopposed.|$|E
500|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} about the plot, the Obama campaign was not immediately notified of the alleged plot; <b>an</b> <b>Obama</b> aide told ABC News, [...] "They were given no heads up." [...] Concerns were already strong about possible plots against Obama due to his status as the first African American presidential nominee for a major political party. The senator had been receiving Secret Service protection since May 2007, which was the earliest for any candidate, and authorities had already foiled an alleged assassination plot at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.|$|E

500|$|During {{and after}} the final debate, McCain {{compared}} Obama's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked [...] "Joe the Plumber" [...] {{as a symbol of}} American small business dreams that would be thwarted by <b>an</b> <b>Obama</b> presidency. McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers. [...] McCain's rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because [...] "he's an Arab", McCain pointedly replied to the woman, [...] "No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues." [...] McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics.

The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was using her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was viewed as a polarizing figure, having both [...] "sharp enmity and deep loyalty" [...] from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since the time of the last election when her husband initially ran for the presidency. It was commented by Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast that her style changed {{over the course of the}} campaign to sensitive and economical.|$|E
