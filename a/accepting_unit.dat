Each client can access the plurality of game programs that the server executes, and a game image created by the accessed game program is displayed on a display unit of the client. Thereafter, a player can play a game from the game program being executed by the server by performing the game operation to the client. A typical conventional casino game system comprises a plurality of independent game devices, and each game device independently executes a game program. According to the system described in U.S. Pat.

The German exemplar stands for an immediate integration with no preconditions and no foregoing reforms on either part but, instead, employing a simple transfer principle and economic backing of the 'accepting' entity.

40|$|Department of Energy EngineeringOrganic {{semiconductors}} that inherently facilitate solution processing {{have attracted}} much interest for near-future electronic {{devices such as}} organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) due to diverse advantages including low cost fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and tunable optoelectronic properties. In spite of significant studies on material science and device physics related to organic semiconductors, {{a better understanding of}} both the efficient synthesis of novel molecules and the development of new fabrication techniques is highly recommended for further development of organic electronics. Until now, even where solution-processable polymeric semiconductors are concerned, impressive progress has been achieved only in developing p-type conjugated polymers. Solution-processable n-type and ambipolar polymers largely remain elusive. In this regard, the present research is focused on developing high electron-affinity semiconductors by a structural modification of electron <b>accepting</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, although tremendous efforts have been focused on the design of building blocks for polymer backbones, relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the molecular engineering of polymer side chains. Thus, the present research investigates modifications of side chains. The work begins with a brief overview of the organic semiconductors followed by introductions of palladium-catalyzed aryl-aryl cross-coupling reactions, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and side chains as well as short explanations of organic electronics. Then, research results that have contributed to the development of high-performance n-type and ambipolar semiconducting polymers are presented as well as followed by polymerization methodology and small molecule-based organic solar cells. ope...|$|E
40|$|Next-generation {{electronic}} devices which are cheap, lightweight and flexible could be realised {{through the use}} of solution processable organic polymer and small molecule semiconductors. Unlike inorganic semiconductors such as silicon, soluble organic semiconductors could be processed using traditional high through-put printing techniques such as roll-to-roll processing and ink-jet printing, which would dramatically reduce manufacturing costs. Whilst organic semiconductors are not expected to be as high performance as inorganic semiconductors, improvements in performance are still required before commercialisation is possible. One way to help improve performance is to exploit the chemical versatility of organic materials. Many different structures can be synthesised through chemical modification, allowing the optoelectronic properties (such as the optical band gap and energy levels) and physical properties (such as solid state structure) of the material to be tuned. Materials can therefore be chemically designed to optimise their performance in organic {{electronic devices}}. This work is focused on exploring the relationship between chemical structure, material properties and device performance, through the design and synthesis of new materials for organic field-effect transistors (OFET) and organic photovoltaics (OPV). The majority of the new materials synthesised in this thesis are new donor-acceptor polymers (Chapters 2 - 6), in which an electron donating monomer and electron accepting monomer are co-polymerised. Whilst there is a vast wealth of different donor monomer structures available, there has been less focus on the synthesis of new electron accepting monomers. In this work the common electron acceptor monomer 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole (BT) is chemically modified to either increase the solubility (Chapter 2) or increase the electron accepting strength (Chapters 3 and 4). Increasing the strength of the electron <b>accepting</b> <b>unit</b> in donor-acceptor polymers was found to induce N-type (electron conducting) behaviour in OFET devices (Chapter 3) or improve OPV performance by reducing the optical band gap and increasing light absorption (Chapter 4).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effects of actual 'chalcogen atoms' on semiconducting properties for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices, a class of donor (D) -acceptor (A) polymer semiconductors, namely PBDP-Fu, PBDP-Th, and PBDP-Se, containing the recently formulated benzodipyrrolidone (BDP) <b>accepting</b> <b>unit</b> and furan (Fu), thiophene (Th), or selenophene (Se) as a donating unit has been synthesized, characterized, and used in an active layer of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). With the LUMO levels being comparatively consistent for all three polymers (- 3. 58 to - 3. 60 eV) due to the dominant BDP contribution to the polymer backbone, the HOMO energies are somewhat sensitive to the structurally distinctive feature of the donor counits used. Utilizing a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), it is apparent that further crystalline domains occur with edge-on orientation for the polymers (PBDP-Th and PBDP-Se) with relatively heavier chalcogen atoms such as Th and Se, compared with PBDP-Fu which has a rather amorphous nature. Investigation of their OFET performance indicates that all the polymers show well balanced ambipolar operations. The desirable morphological structures of both the PBDP-Th and PBDP-Se result in higher mobilities in OFETs than those of PBDP-Fu. In particular, 200 °C annealed PBDP-Se OFETs results in ambipolarity being mobile for both holes of up to 1. 7 × 10 - 2 cm 2 /V·s and electrodes of up to 1. 9 × 10 - 2 cm 2 /V·s. In addition, OFETs with PBDP-Th show nearly equivalent charge carrier mobilities for both holes (μh = 1. 2 × 10 - 2 cm 2 /V·s) and electrons (μe = 1. 1 × 10 - 2 cm 2 / V·s). Consequently, we systematically demonstrate how the manipulation of existing heteroaromatics can modulate the electronic properties of conjugated D-A polymers, elucidating structure-property relationships that are desirable for the rational design of next generation materials. close 0...|$|E

S 6 and S 7 contain a common electron-accepting moiety, naphthalene diimide (NDI), with different electron-donating moieties, triphenylamine (S 6) and benzothiophene (S 7), and {{are based on a}} donor-acceptor-donor structure. S 7 was isolated as black, rod-shaped crystals. Its triclinic structure was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD) : space group P 1 ̄, Z = 2, a = 9. 434 (5) Å, b = 14. 460 (7) Å, c = 15. 359 (8) Å, α = 67. 256 (9) degrees, β = 80. 356 (11) degrees, γ = 76. 618 (10) degrees, at 150 Kelvin (K), R = 0. 073. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra revealed that use of triphenylamine donor functionality with the NDI acceptor unit resulted in an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition and reduction of the optical band gap compared with the benzothiophene analogue. Solution-processable inverted bulk heterojunction devices with the structure indium tin oxide/zinc oxide (30 nm) /active layer/molybdenum trioxide (10 nm) /silver (100 nm) were fabricated with S 6 and S 7 as donors and (6, 6) -phenyl C 70 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70 BM) as acceptor. Power conversion efficiencies of 0. 22 % for S 6 /PC 70 BM and 0. 10 % for S 7 /PC 70 BM were achieved for the preliminary photovoltaic devices under simulated AM 1. 5 illumination (100 mW cm- 2).

The solution-processable electron acceptor (DPP 1) based on fluorene and diketopyrrolopyrrole conjugated moieties was designed, synthesized and characterized completely. DPP 1 revealed excellent solubility and high thermal stability which are vital for easy processing. Upon using DPP 1 acceptor with the classical electron donor poly (3 -hexylthiophene), solution processable bulk-heterojunction solar cells afforded a high open-circuit voltage. A value of {{open circuit voltage}} {{is one of the}} highest values reported so far for a bulk-heterojunction device using DPP 1 non-fullerene acceptor. The materials which were designed, synthesized, characterized and tested for bulk heterojunction solar cells indicated that there relationship between the three fragments (donor- spacer-acceptor) of a donor-acceptor (D-A) design. Also interested to the design and advancement of new chromopheres based on donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) module and push-pull chromopheres used. Naphthalene diimide (NDI), current research interested because of its interesting physical and electronic properties. A potential advantage of naphthalene diimide (NDI) <b>accepting</b> <b>unit</b> is its amenability to incorporate alkyl chains on the nitrogen atoms. The target materials solubility enhance because of these alkyl chain and also excellent film formation without crystallization. To generate new push-pull chromophers, first time NDI has been used in conjugation with triphenylamine (TPA) and benzothiophene (BT) donor functionality based on a D-A-D module that has been fabricated in solution processable inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices. Similar observation was found in development of small molecular chromopheres for BHJ. Diketopyrrolopyrrol (DPP) building blocks were reported as a potential electron deficient fragment for the development of non-fullerene acceptor chromopheres and NDI unit has interesting physical and electronic properties. Due to these reasons, new non-fullerene electron acceptors based on NDI and DPP functionalities investigated, where NDI was chosen as the central core with DPP terminal units. It has been applied solution-processable BHJ device along with the classic electron donor, poly (3 -hexythiophene) (P 3 HT). NDI and DPP unit exhibited excellent thermal stability, broad absorption and appropriate energy levels matching with P 3 HT. Two-novel solution processable small organic molecules were successfully designed, synthesized and characterized based on a D-A-D structural motif with a common electron accepting moiety, isoindigo with different electron donating functionalities triphenylamine and carbazole respectively. Carbazole analogue compared with triphenylamine (TPA) donor functionality, TPA resulted in an enhanced intramolecular Charge transfer transition and reduction of optical band gap. TPA and carbazole were designed to donor components excellent solubility in common organic solvents, thermal stability and their promising optoelectronics properties encourage to charge-carrier motilities using solution-processable organic field effective transistors. Overall this study provides an examination of the effect of changing the donor central bridge and acceptor part of the donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) modular material for the BHJ solar cells. It is interesting to see how the donor and acceptor modifications in a given D-A module may affect the performance of these materials used for BHJ solar cells...|$|E
