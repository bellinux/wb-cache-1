5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light.

5|$|Butterfly {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, {{but many of the}} blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E

5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> cross joints. Erosion {{acting on}} master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints {{is responsible for}} creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} {{and developmental}} biology. Mutants <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting.

5|$|The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follow trails laid by meat ants {{to locate}} them, and the snakes are also known {{to feed on}} the brood. Various species of spiders prefer to prey on meat ants, mainly {{attracted}} by the alarm pheromone the ants release. One spider, in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is a specialist predator against these ants and uses their alarm pheromones that are released during territorial disputes to locate them. These alarm signals <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> oscillating the body along the longitudinal axis, which are mostly released when an ant encounters a nest mate.|$|E

5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E
5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E

5|$|Dragonlance {{is set on}} {{the world}} of Krynn. The {{majority}} of the novels {{take place in the}} various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world's major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending on the time period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells. During Krynn's various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian humanoid. The eggs of good dragons create evil draconians, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, {{as the water}} slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
