25|$|However, {{from the}} autumn of 2011, a new grading scale has been {{introduced}} into the Swedish school system: A, B, C, D, and E as passing grades and F as failing. B and D work as filling grades, for when a student hasn't reached all objectives for C or A but has reached most of them. If the student can't be graded, e.g. extensive truancy, the student will receive a dash instead of an F. If <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> {{on the verge of}} receiving an F in a certain subject/course, the teacher responsible for that subject will notify the student and the student's parents. If <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> given an F, they will receive a written review of how to improve themselves.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{children}} are of a similar aptitude level and may be skilled in different paradigms and fields.

25|$|If <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> not {{seated in}} his or her chair, with their bags off their desk when the bell rings, they must leave class and report to room 32, a {{detention}} room, and miss that class for that day, receiving a 0. This policy is designed to teach students the importance of punctuality.|$|E
25|$|When <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> {{admitted}} to a gymnasium, he chooses a studieretning ("specialized study programme") between {{a number of different}} programmes with different subjects. These subjects in these programmes are customised by the local school leadership. Each school has to offer at least 4 different programmes, with a least one focusing on mathematics and natural science, one focusing on foreign languages, and one focusing on social studies.|$|E

25|$|Carnatic {{music is}} {{traditionally}} taught {{according to the}} system formulated by Purandara Dasa. This involves varisais (graded exercises), alankaras (exercises based on the seven talas), geetams or simple songs, and Swarajatis. After the student has reached a certain standard, varnams are taught and later, the student learns kritis. It typically takes several years of learning before <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> adept enough to perform at a concert.|$|E

25|$|The University {{has five}} {{conventional}} residence halls. A {{record number of}} applicants is now requiring Student Life and the Department of University Housing to contract with nearby apartment complexes and hotels. The housing shortage creates student wait lists and financial aid complications. Private rooms typically are not available even if <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> willing to pay significantly higher rates. Students seeking exemption from the living on campus requirement have to fill out and return paperwork.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in recent}} years, {{there has been}} {{controversy}} over even consensual sexual interactions between students and teachers, especially within the last decade. Like many, Gallop asserts that the relationships between a teacher and <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> very much {{like that of a}} parent and a child. (Gallop, 1997) However, it is this parallel that many say is the reason teacher-pupil sexual contact and relations are immoral because they are too closely akin to incest, and similar long-term damages can result.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{available}} rooms in university residences is limited, which requires some students to find private boarding. Students in private lodgings {{can join the}} Private Students' Organisation (PSO), also known as Private Wards. There are 6 PSO wards, and <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> assigned to one according {{to the location of}} their lodgings in Stellenbosch. Students who commute to the university are assigned to one of two mixed-gender wards. As of 2008, four new PSO wards had been commissioned. The oldest residence is Wilgenhof men's residence, established in 1903.|$|E
25|$|It is {{stated that}} if <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> {{successful}} in awakening consciousness, {{he or she}} will eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness are not aware of their postmortem condition, just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.|$|E

25|$|Students of Ethiopian liturgical chants {{study the}} Ge'ez language, and begin {{practicing}} singing in childhood. Education {{takes place in}} liturgical dance schools called aqwaqwam bét and includes, in addition to singing and dancing, training in traditional instruments such as the käbäro, drums, tsänatsel, sistrum, and mäqwamya. Singing students (däqä mermur) become singers (däbtära) and some will eventually become masters (märigéta). <b>A</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> considered ready when he has mastered the complicated genre of qené. It has been suggested by Monneret de Villard that liturgical dance, that always accompanies the music, has its origins in the Ancient Egyptian dance.|$|E
25|$|Contrastingly {{in other}} Asian cultures, {{especially}} for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other {{factors such as}} education. Academic success of <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> seen {{as a source of}} pride and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work hard to avoid academic failure which brings shame to the family. In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In Japan, for example, ritualized suicide practices such as harakiri were committed by Japanese samurai for centuries {{in the event of a}} defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with the shame of defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.|$|E
25|$|Additionally to the Five Fists {{and animal}} shapes, many {{lineages}} employ {{the training of}} several additional movement forms - from a handful to a few dozen. Some of the more common forms are partner forms, which simulate combat scenarios. Once the individual animal shapes are taught, <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> often taught an animal linking form (shi'er xing lianhuan) which connects all the taught animals together in a sequence. Some styles have longer, or multiple forms for individual animals, such Eight Tiger Forms Huxing bashi. Other forms often link movements from the Five Fists, the different animal shapes, or both, and commonly include additional movements and techniques not found elsewhere. There also exist a Ba Zi Gong linking form and many weapons forms.|$|E

25|$|At UMass Amherst, only freshmen are {{required}} to live on campus. Housing {{is open to all}} full-time undergraduate students, regardless of year. Upper-class students who have continuously lived on campus during their first and sophomore years are guaranteed housing as long as they choose to live on campus. If, however, <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> admitted after their sophomore year, or moves off campus, and wants to move back onto campus, they are not guaranteed housing, but instead must go through a housing lottery, since demand outstrips supply. Housing assignments are accomplished by a complex process that takes into account building seniority as well as class year; those choosing to move from their building are subject to a lottery system. There are approximately 12,000 students living on campus.|$|E
25|$|In {{most public}} places in Canada a kirpan is allowed, {{although}} there have been some court cases regarding carrying on school premises. In the 2006 Supreme Court of Canada decision of Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys the court held that the banning of the kirpan in a school environment offended Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that the restriction could not be upheld under s. 1 of the Charter, as per R. v. Oakes. The issue started when a 12-year-old schoolboy dropped a 20cm (8-inch) long kirpan in school. School staff and parents were very concerned, and the student was required to attend school under police supervision until the court decision was reached. <b>A</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> allowed to have a kirpan on his person if it is sealed and secured.|$|E
25|$|The University of Ottawa’s co-op {{program is}} {{available}} {{for a wide range}} of programs for undergraduate students. Co-operative programs are offered in English and in French for certain programs. There are various programs offered in the following faculties: arts, social sciences, engineering, science and law. The faculty of arts offers the option of co-op for the following programs: communications, lettres Français, English, environmental studies, geography, history, and translation, along with the option of combining two programs in cases where <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> completing a joint honours program (i.e. sociology and communications). The faculty of social sciences offers co-op options for the following programs: anthropology, sociology, human rights, conflict studies, economics, political science, international development and globalization, public policy, and public administration. In the faculties of arts and social sciences, work terms usually begin in the second summer of a student’s studies (where <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>is</b> done second year and entering third) with the exception of the translation program where the first work term begins the summer before a student’s fourth year. Each program offers specific conditions that a student must meet in order to participate in his or her placement. For the science and engineering faculties, the co-op programs offered are: chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, software engineering, other various engineering programs, biomedical science, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, earth sciences, physics, environmental science, statistics, and other various science programs. All the engineering programs offered at the University of Ottawa begin during the summer before a student’s third year. However, the science faculty’s programs offer different starting points for the different programs mentioned above. The University of Ottawa’s co-op’s page offers a more detailed view on these starting points. The faculty of law offers a co-op program for civil law in French. The requirements consist of the same general requirements for acceptance and maintaining a position in the program.|$|E
