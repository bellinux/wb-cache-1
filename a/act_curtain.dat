2500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! (1943) {{completed}} the revolution begun by Show Boat, by tightly integrating all {{the aspects of}} musical theatre, with a cohesive plot, songs that furthered {{the action of the}} story, and featured dream ballets and other dances that advanced the plot and developed the characters, rather than using dance as an excuse to parade scantily clad women across the stage. Rodgers and Hammerstein hired ballet choreographer Agnes de Mille, who used everyday motions to help the characters express their ideas. It defied musical conventions by raising its first <b>act</b> <b>curtain</b> not on a bevy of chorus girls, but rather on a woman churning butter, with an off-stage voice singing the opening lines of Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' unaccompanied. It drew rave reviews, set off a box-office frenzy and received a Pulitzer Prize. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that the show's opening number changed the history of musical theater: “After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable." [...] It was the first [...] "blockbuster" [...] Broadway show, running a total of 2,212 performances, and was made into a hit film. It {{remains one of the most}} frequently produced of the team's projects. William A. Everett and Paul R. Laird wrote that this was a [...] "show, that, like Show Boat, became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to Oklahoma!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 a fire {{broke out}} in the theatre. A ghost light nicknamed [...] "Larry The Light" [...] was left too close to the <b>act</b> <b>curtain</b> by the theatre's {{cleaning}} crew. The light ignited the curtain, and the flames spread quickly. Damages amounting to $300,000 included the loss of the <b>act</b> <b>curtain,</b> damage to the stage floor, and smoke damage to the auditorium walls and ceiling.|$|E

50|$|The front curtain, {{which is}} {{variously}} called a grand drape, <b>act</b> <b>curtain,</b> house curtain, house drape, main drape, main rag, or, in the UK, tabs, hangs downstage, {{just behind the}} proscenium arch. It is typically opened and closed during performances to reveal or conceal the stage and scenery from the audience.|$|E
5000|$|The {{techniques}} of well-made plays also {{lend themselves to}} comedies of situation, often farce. In The Quintessence of Ibsenism, Bernard Shaw proposed that Ibsen converted this formula for use in [...] "serious" [...] plays by substituting discussion for the plausible dénouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, {{as if there were}} life for the protagonists beyond the last <b>act</b> <b>curtain.</b>|$|E

And everybody is wondering how it will come out, or rather how it can possibly come out at all, because some of them explain that it's all wrong, and just as they are making it clear that there shouldn't be any third <b>act,</b> the <b>curtain</b> goes up and it's---- ...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{inspiration}} for Thunder Rock came in 1938 while the playwright, Robert Ardrey, then on an extended honeymoon on Nantucket, {{was working on}} a different play. He writes in his autobiography of being taken by the image of the lighthouse as Siansconset and by the drama of the frequent nor'easters. At the same time, the conflict in Europe was escalating, and Ardrey took the signing of the Munich Agreement to be a certain harbinger of war. Ardrey did not have the idea for the play, however, until he returned to New York. He writes in his autobiography of the moment of inspiration during a performance of Swan Lake:That afternoon, eyes closed, enjoying the music with moderation, I descended into a world between the Tigris and the Styx. And within the course of the performance I had beheld Thunder Rock. I had the play from beginning to end, complete with the first, second, and third <b>act</b> <b>curtains.</b> I never had the experience again, and I must wonder how many authors have gone through a similar spell. Ardrey moved with his wife, Helen, to New Orleans, where he wrote the first draft.|$|R
50|$|The oleo was a {{versatile}} drop for {{any sort of}} entertainment. The oleo drop often hung in the in-one position, subdividing the stage into a shallower depth that was more appropriate for a brief interlude. The <b>act</b> <b>curtain</b> or drop curtain functioned as today's main drape, the decorative divider wall between audience and stage. Often, {{it was the most}} elaborate piece a theater owned and was painted to harmonize with the interior decorations of the theater itself.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "monkey fur"—actually crushed velvet—wall {{covering}} {{that was}} brown {{for more than}} a generation, has been restored back to its original vivid blood orange hue through a supplier in Germany. Gold brocade draperies from France now accent the walls, replace the <b>act</b> <b>curtain,</b> and dress the lobby stairway landing. The auditorium floor was also refurbished to better accommodate handicap access, and the lobby, aisle, and atrium carpeting was restored with a recreation of the original Art Deco pattern that lined the floors when the theatre opened in 1931. The lighting, sound, and fire alarm systems were also updated, restoring the venue back to state-of-the-art status.|$|E
50|$|The {{final act}} and the pigeon circus {{had been used}} in an earlier Porky Pig cartoon called Curtain Razor in which a fox does the same act Daffy does {{attempting}} to show Porky he is a star, and, much like Show Biz Bugs, the final <b>act</b> in <b>Curtain</b> Razor has been edited on Cartoon Network to remove him ingesting gasoline (the syndicated version of The Merrie Melodies Show also cuts the gasoline-drinking and edits it even further by cutting out the fox swallowing a match).|$|R

The play starred Pauline Lord, who had been the {{original}} Anna Christie on Broadway. The play had a great reception. Time magazine wrote, [...] "In London, the first night of Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie, with Pauline Lord in the title role, received a tremendous ovation. After the first <b>act</b> the <b>curtain</b> was rung up a dozen times during the applause.|$|R

60|$|The gallery, less {{sensitive}} or more genuinely patriotic, thundered on, applauding the lines {{as well as}} the growing power of Helen's impersonation. Royleston was at last beginning to play, the fumes of his heavy dinner having cleared away. He began to grip his lines, and that gave the star her first opportunity to forget his weakness and throw herself into her part. All in all, only a very discriminating ear could have detected a falling-off of favor in this <b>act.</b> The <b>curtain</b> was lifted four times, and a few feeble cries for the author were heard, chiefly from the first balcony.|$|R

Cliff in turn hands it to Helena and leaves, saying [...] "I hope he rams it up your nostrils". Almost immediately, Jimmy bursts in. His contempt at finding a [...] "goodbye" [...] note makes him turn on Helena again, warning her {{to keep out of}} his way until she leaves. Helena tells him that Alison is expecting a baby, and Jimmy admits grudgingly that he's taken aback. However, his tirade continues.

2500|$|After {{frequently}} changing members, Chosuke Ikariya re-formed The Drifters in 1964 {{under the}} same name. At a Beatles concert in 1966, they <b>acted</b> as <b>curtain</b> raisers, but the audience generally objected.

After a natural disaster, or during brush clearing activities, debris is disposed of by incineration in either a ceramic or earth pit containment.

The air <b>curtain</b> <b>acts</b> as a lid on the process, and forces the smoke back into the fuel bed for a cleaner burn.|$|R

5|$|In {{the downstairs}} lounge, {{a few minutes}} before the <b>Act</b> 2 <b>curtain</b> for Me and Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the {{remarkable}} conclusion to Act 1—although the audience has noticed nothing unusual ("Intermission Talk"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors ("It Feels Good"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet, where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date ("We Deserve Each Other"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out ("I'm Your Girl"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well.|$|R

Achille confesses {{his love}} for Polixene to Arcas, who reminds the hero that his {{original}} intent was to avenge their dead friend Patrocle. Achille counters {{that it is only}} Hector who deserves his wrath; the rest of the Trojans are not to blame. Agamemnon enters and also questions Achille's allegiance. Achille reminds him that it is for Patrocle, not the Greeks, that he engaged the Trojans. Agamemnon, realizing that Achille has fallen in love with the enemy princess, introduces the great hero to Briseis, a Greek princess whom he hopes will win Achille back {{to the side of the}} Greeks. Briseis confides to Achille the story of her capture and the loss of all she loved. Achille, as gallantly as possible, explains that he cannot love her. Furious, Briseis calls on the goddess Juno to avenge her broken heart. Juno accepts and promises that before the day is over, Briseis will see the result of her request. The act concludes with a chorus of shepherds offering thanks for the peace established by the [...] "generous conqueror." ...|$|R
40|$|Suicide is a {{frequent}} and important occurrence in the oeuvre of Shakespeare. While Shakespeare's male characters typically contemplate and commit suicide on stage, complete with lofty, pensive soliloquies on the matter, his female characters often commit their <b>acts</b> behind the <b>curtain</b> and are given few to no lines to clarify their deeds or dictate how they wish to be remembered. In minimizing the amount of dialogue and freedom of speech of female characters, Shakespeare uses silence as a literary device to subtly {{draw attention to the}} ambiguities surrounding their suicidal or potentially suicidal deaths. Once examined, the situations reveal themselves to be significantly more complex than they appear topically, and often illuminate the roles and positions of women in the suppressive Renaissance society...|$|R
