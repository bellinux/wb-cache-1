5|$|In 2003, Radioactive Films used a {{scene from}} Striptease {{featuring}} Moore nude in a video called Hollywood's Hottest. This raised a dispute as to whether use of the scene qualified <b>as</b> <b>fair</b> use. A lawsuit was launched as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film series (2001–2003), {{all of the}} elves (including Wood Elves) {{are portrayed}} <b>as</b> <b>fair,</b> graceful, and wise beings with supernatural {{abilities}} like enhanced eyesight. While they facially resemble humans, they transcend beauty, with much longer and finer hair and an apparent inner glow. They also have pointed ears and no facial hair.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 Welsh health survey, {{conducted}} by the Welsh Assembly, reported that 51% of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21% described their health <b>as</b> <b>fair</b> or poor. The survey also recorded that 27% of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Enquiries into health-related lifestyle choices report 27% {{of the adult population}} are smokers, 45% admit drinking alcohol above recommended guidelines at least once a week, while 29% undertake the recommended weekly physical activity.|$|E

5|$|In 1959–60, {{the season}} {{started with a}} Test trial between the XIs of Lindwall and Benaud. Meckiff claimed a match total of 4/90 for Lindwall's men and was {{selected}} for the Test tour of Pakistan and India. Before the team departed, Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action, which used a rigid left arm during the run-up, before swinging the arm over during the delivery stride. Over the next two years, sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action <b>as</b> <b>fair,</b> and said so in public. He was not called for throwing in either India or Pakistan, meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Prince and Princess {{shared the}} outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was {{haunted by the}} fear that should the old Emperor dieand he was now in his seventiesthey would call {{on one of the}} Progressive leaders to become Chancellor. He sought to guard against such a turn by keeping the Crown Prince from a {{position}} of any influence and by using foul means as well <b>as</b> <b>fair</b> to make him unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Wilton {{returned}} for the series' 2005 Christmas special as Davies wanted {{to include a}} familiar character whose presence would ease the transition following {{a change in the}} series' lead actor. Despite her character having been introduced <b>as</b> <b>fair</b> minded and hard working, Harriet is depicted as an uncompromising Prime Minister, which led to comparisons to real life politicians. Response to the character's political decisions prompted mixed commentary from the media; some reviewers felt that the character had acted unreasonably whilst others sympathised with her actions and felt her scripted political demise was unjust.|$|E

2500|$|For the 2015 Women's Ashes series, {{the points}} system was changed, so that four points were awarded {{for a test}} match win, rather than six.

[...] Australia won the series 10–6.|$|R
5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm (also known <b>as</b> <b>Fair</b> Laughs the Morn and Youth and Pleasure) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832 and currently in Tate Britain. Etty {{had been planning}} the painting since 1818–19, and an early version was exhibited in 1822. The piece {{was inspired by a}} metaphor in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of Richard II of England was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is {{referred}} to <b>as</b> <b>fair</b> territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In {{the middle of the}} infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1941 and the {{beginning}} of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with a further 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children. Most of these people were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily Niš, Smederevo and Šabac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated, and whose windows were shattered due to German bombing raids carried out during the invasion of Yugoslavia. Originally constructed <b>as</b> <b>fair</b> pavilions, the largest of these barracks held up to 5,000 prisoners. Inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics, slept on wet straw or bare floorboards, and were provided with inadequate amounts of food. Starvation was widespread, and Jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to Serbian authorities for more food to be provided to the camp. Consequently, a high number of detainees, especially children, died in late 1941 and early 1942, with many inmates freezing to death in one of the coldest winters on record. The Romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their Jewish counterparts. They also slept on straw in an unheated hall, but were kept separate from non-Romani prisoners. The majority of Romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention. Most Jewish inmates remained detained, with the exception of ten Jewish women who were married to Christian men.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} two decades of RTÉ 2, little {{original}} drama was produced for the channel; often RTÉ would just repeat their dramas on the channel such <b>as</b> <b>Fair</b> City and Glenroe. RTÉ did place some emphasis on short film in the RTÉ 2 series Short Cuts. Short films remain on RTÉ 2 most Monday nights at 11:30; these shorts are not just taken from RTÉ co-financed productions but also from independent producers around the world.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through Fair Trade.
