This paper demonstrates a novel method for registering images ob-tained from low resolution visual sensor networks.

In {{order to}} improve the {{technical}} level, perforation efficiency and ability of LWD- 200 B full hydraulic open cut mine drill {{to adapt to the}} complex geological conditions, we developed LWD- 200 B multi-function full hydraulic open cut mine drill, the drill has rotary cutting, impact and roller bit drill three functions. The drill travel use hydraulic motor to drive crawler belt running gear, low speed high torque hydraulic motor to direct top drive drilling rod. Pressure and lifting system use a long stroke hydraulic cylinder, wire rope and pulley mechanism, load sensing constant power variable pump, load sensing electromagnetic proportional multi-way directional valve. The control system uses electronic control handle and PLC controller, design pressure, speed, length, temperature sensors etc. and GPS base station, with real-time data acquisition, display, lithology <b>automatic</b> <b>identification,</b> closed-loop feedback <b>control,</b> GPS precise positioning, the manual and automatic drilling, specified depth or level drilling function.

40|$|Polar {{orbiting}} satellites {{with low}} spatial resolution sensors, {{such as the}} AVHRR, provide repeated global coverage of the Earth. The data is directly transmitted to ground stations, {{and in some cases}} distributed immediately after the data acquisition. Near real time applications can be implemented if the adequate processing tools are available. This paper presents a near real time processing system, developed for NOAA/AVHRR data acquired from the Dundee satellite station. The system performs image calibration, geometric corrections and atmospheric corrections with minimum operator intervention. The geometric corrections consist of an orbital-based correction refined by the <b>automatic</b> <b>identification</b> of Ground <b>Control</b> Points (GCPs) by image matching. The atmospheric correction is based on simulations performed on the 6 S radiative transfer code using a set of typical and expected values for the most significant parameters. An attempt to evaluate the error associated with the simplified atmospheric correction method was carried out. As an illustration, 3 AVHRR images from NOAA 16 were processed. The ranges of values encountered for the most relevant parameters were analysed. The range and average values for the reflectance channels 1 and 2 with and without the atmospheric correction are compared. These were used to produce standard Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images and atmospheric corrected NDVI images...|$|R

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>identification</b> {{technologies}} {{are used in}} a wide range of applications. The applications vary from process automation to security control. The publications written on the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>identification</b> have been very practice oriented, and usually written by systems providers inclined to marketing their solutions. Until now, few efforts have been made to classify the various <b>automatic</b> <b>identification</b> applications. Furthermore, the suitability of different identification technologies to different kinds of logistics applications has been scarcely studied by neutral parties. First, this article builds four categories of <b>automatic</b> <b>identification</b> applications: Authentication, tracking, process effectiveness, and information management applications. Then, the article reviews different identification technologies on their technological basis, and functionality. Finally, criteria for evaluating the functionality of different technologies in the application areas are proposed. The criteria are then applied to compare bar coding and radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies in the different types of applications.

40|$|Conference PaperSecond-order {{statistical}} methods show very good results for <b>automatic</b> speaker <b>identification</b> in <b>controlled</b> recording conditions. These approaches are generally {{used on the}} entire speech material available. In this paper, we study {{the influence of the}} content of the test speech material on the performances of such methods, i. e. under a more analytical approach. The goal is to investigate on the kind of information which is used by these methods, and where it is located in the speech signal. Liquids and glides together, vowels, and more particularly nasal vowels and nasal consonants, are found to be particularly speaker specific: test utterances of 1 second, composed in majority of acoustic material from one of these classes provide better speaker identification results than phonetically balanced test utterances, even though the training is done, in both cases, with 15 seconds of phonetically balanced speech. Nevertheless, results with other phoneme classes are never dramatically poor. These results tend to show that the speaker-dependent information captured by long-term second-order statistics is consistently common to all phonetic classes, and that the homogeneity of the test material may improve the quality of the estimates...|$|R
40|$|Radio Frequency Identification is a hot, new {{business}} topic that is widely misunderstood and vastly over-hyped. To {{better understand how}} it can be evaluated for use in a supply chain, some points of information and caution must be considered. This paper will review both the informational aspects that may apply as well as areas where caution or questioning is warranted. It begins with a brief dis cussion on <b>Automatic</b> <b>Identification</b> and Radio Frequency Identification and then moves into current RFID applications within supply chains. Problem areas are discussed that affect decisions on which system, if any, is appropriate for a specific supply chain application.
