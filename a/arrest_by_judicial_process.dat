60|$|After the {{execution}} of Charles I., Jan. 30, 1649, it became more than ever necessary for all thoughtful men to express their convictions. For a people to put to death its king <b>by</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>process</b> was an unheard of event. Those who considered that the Parliament had acted within the law and {{could not have done}} otherwise with due regard to the welfare of the nation had to convince doubting and timid citizens at home, and also, so far as was possible, to placate critics in other nations who still believed that the king could do no wrong; for all Europe interested itself in this tremendous act of the English Parliament.|$|R

This was a form of civil death. Similarly, a slave was a chattel or possession, and had no legal personality except that, in the U.S., some of the Free States did allow limited legal personality. Legal personality could be surrendered voluntarily by becoming a monk or by travelling, e.g. the first provisions of the French Civil Code deny civil rights to foreigners. As an aspect of the social contract between a state and the citizens who owe it allegiance, most developed legal systems contain positive provisions defining each individual's legal identity and its attributes. All matters of social rank or caste are examples of personal status, the modern extremes of which would be nobility and the 200 million dalits, the untouchables of India.|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} to analyze {{to what extent}} the scope of executive privilege, constitutionally committed to the executive branch, is determined <b>by</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>process</b> or <b>by</b> purely political factors. It opens with a brief report on the process of formation of the Presidential model of government and the system of checks and balances in the United States. Focusing on the checks imposed on the Executive, this article distinguishes those restraints that are clearly constitutionalized, or stemming from judicial determination of their constitutionality, and those which are the result of judicial interpretation of the beneficial aspects of public policy or political decisions of the Congress. It then concludes with the observation that the flexibility built into the Constitution by ambiguous language or simply by the gaps left by the Framers, does not always result in a healthy process of the parliamentary implementation of the Constitution. In contrast, such ambiguities actually may lead to awkward political meddling with the constitutional concept of presidential government, affecting the integrity of the Constitution...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the hidden history of criminal justice in late colonial Australia by focussing on Aboriginal inter-se offending. Most Aboriginal defendants appearing in late colonial criminal courts were prosecuted for violent crimes against other Aboriginal people. The article explores how common such cases were {{and the degree to}} which the acknowledgment of cultural difference affected justice process and outcomes. The frequent invocation of ‘custom’ commonly led juries to recommend the mercy of the Crown to those Aboriginal defendants found guilty of committing a homicide. I argue that ‘custom’ was increasingly used <b>by</b> settler <b>judicial</b> <b>processes</b> as a shorthand way of explaining what was otherwise seen as unexplainable. In the twentieth century ‘custom’ would receive greater attention through the development of jurisprudence and policy around the idea of customary law. Arts, Education and LawFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper defends {{judicial}} review {{on the grounds}} that {{judicial review}} is necessary for protecting “a right to a hearing. ” Judicial review is praised by its advocates on the basis of instrumentalist reasons, i. e., because of its desirable contingent consequences such as protecting rights, romoting democracy, maintaining stability, etc. We argue that instrumentalist easons for judicial review are bound to fail and that an adequate defense of udicial review requires justifying judicial review on non-instrumentalist grounds. A non-instrumentalist justification grounds judicial review in essential attributes of he <b>judicial</b> <b>process.</b> In searching for a non-instrumental justification we establish that judicial review is designed to protect the right to a hearing. The right to a hearing consists of hree components: the opportunity to voice a grievance, the opportunity to be rovided with a justification for a decision that impinges (or may have impinged) on one’s rights and, last, the duty to reconsider the initial decision giving rise to the grievance. The right to a hearing is valued independently of the merit of the decisions generated <b>by</b> the <b>judicial</b> <b>process.</b> We also argue that the recent proposals to reinforce popular or democratic participation in shaping the Constitution are wrong because they are detrimental to the right to a hearing. ...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction {{ought to}} be {{considered}} as a unit, ” 1 then the politics of Reconstruction began the moment that Abraham Lincoln and other Northern leaders chose war over the Lower South’s secession. WAR, POLITICS, AND PEACE Lincoln’s delusion that the South was full of Unionists loyal to the government over which he presided emboldened him to call for volunteers to suppress “combinations ” too numerous to be dealt with <b>by</b> normal <b>judicial</b> <b>processes.</b> His call precipitated most of the Upper South into secession, and Kentucky proclaimed its neutrality if war should break out between the two federations. Only swift federal coercion held Maryland, along with parts of Kentucky and Missouri, for the Union. Many in the North were hesitant to risk war, especially when they could not find a Constitutional power whereby the general government could coerce whole states. For a time, Northern Democrats even discussed setting up a Middle Atlantic confederation, since the old Union had evidently outlived its usefulness. 2 Historian-in-Residence at the Ludwig von Mises Institute...|$|R

40|$|To {{the great}} relief of many, American {{criminal}} law, long {{known for its}} harshness and expansive prohibitory reach, is now showing signs of softening. A prime example of this shift {{is seen in the}} proliferation of laws decriminalizing the personal possession of small amounts of marijuana: today, almost twenty states and dozens of localities have embraced decriminalization in some shape or form, with more laws very likely coming to fruition soon. Despite enjoying broad political support, the decriminalization movement has however failed to curb a core feature of criminalization: police authority to arrest individuals suspected of possessing marijuana. Arrests for marijuana possession have skyrocketed in number in recent years, including within decriminalization jurisdictions. This essay examines the chief reasons behind this disconnect, centering on powerful institutional incentives among police to continue to make <b>arrests,</b> enabled <b>by</b> <b>judicial</b> doctrine that predates the recent shift toward decriminalization. The essay also identifies ways to help ensure that laws decriminalizing simple marijuana possession, as well as other low-level offenses, better achieve decriminalization’s goal of limiting the arrest authority of police and the many negative personal consequences of arrest...|$|R

As a teenager, Mura had taken part in burglaries from basements of properties on the estate. He was also known to take drugs and drink a lot of alcohol. Mura was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment by the Court of Assizes in Chalon-sur-Saône. He appealed the sentence to the Court of Appeal in Dijon, but this court agreed with the original sentence handed down, despite believing that Mura was showing the early stages of schizophrenia when he committed the murder.|$|R

Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition were to be considered. Car theft charges ranged from 3 to 10 years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial.
