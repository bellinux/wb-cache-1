2500|$|The {{first task}} for the attackers {{was to take the}} {{outlying}} redoubt of La Cachotte, which covered the approaches to Fort William. The trench was opened on 8 June; a major assault – consisting of seven battalions, accompanied by the Kings’ Musketeers – followed on 12 June. La Cachotte fell, and Vauban turned to seizing Fort William, which was personally defended by Coehoorn. The fort was well sited, just over the crest of the rise, obscuring the stronghold from the attackers until they were almost upon it, and masking its walls from artillery fire. French sappers approached from two directions, but the recent heavy rain had made the whole operation extremely difficult. In a dramatic gesture, Coehoorn ordered his own grave dug to symbolise his commitment to defend the position to the end, but although his grave was not needed, the Dutch engineer was wounded in the head by a shell that killed his valet. The final assault on Fort William came on 22 June; despite Coehoorn’s resolute defence, he and the 200 men who had garrisoned the fort, capitulated. Vauban greeted his rival the next day, consoling him that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had, [...] " [...] … the honour of being attacked by the greatest king in the world." [...] To which Coehoorn replied that his real consolation was in {{the fact that he had}} forced his great rival to move his siege batteries seven times during the assault.|$|E
60|$|Reggie {{grew more}} cheerful. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{an answer for}} that.|$|E
60|$|He {{may have}} drowsed; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a vision, {{very real and}} plain, a vision very {{different}} from any dream of Utopia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{been washed}} once,' said Mrs. King; 'but he's so queer; I hope <b>he</b> will <b>have</b> no fancies, and will behave himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not {{finished}} dressing yet, Master Clinton; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{not come out}} of his room. But I expect he is pretty near dressed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid he}} doesn't care {{for me in}} that way. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> said nothing. You {{understand}} that I am only telling you this because----" ...|$|R
60|$|He was dizzy with rage. For {{the first}} time in his life he had been trampled upon, and could not, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not, struck his assailant.|$|E
60|$|Wulf {{thought as}} he looked at the speaker that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no second thought in his mind. It was a frank honest face, martial in its outline, but {{softened}} by a pleasant smile.|$|E
6000|$|He left her, and {{happiness}} {{went out of}} his life as at nightfall the daylight goes out of the day. Well, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his work to go to. But Beatrice, poor woman, what had she? ...|$|E
6000|$|Hal {{went off}} on another tack. [...] "Well, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> set me down by this time; and Papa will have me up to London for my outfit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Frances, {{adopting}} {{the manner of}} her brother, [...] "Harvey Birch is not without good feelings; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the appearance of them at times." ...|$|R
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty whilst acting as observer to offensive patrols. On four occasions, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> shot down enemy scouts {{and has also}} had numerous indecisive combats, in all of which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> displayed the greatest gallantry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll send him, but {{to chase}} him off is an ill turn. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{the sense to}} fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the Holy One did not say, {{acquiring}} merit.' ...|$|E
60|$|Satisfied or not, he {{had time}} to get very angry with her again before the sermon was over. She had never once looked his way; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been so lucky as to {{encounter}} a glance.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} {{at him through}} the darkness, yet he could see that one thing <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> achieved. Her bosom was rising and falling quickly, her voice shook as she {{answered}} him. For {{the first time he had}} penetrated that intolerable reserve.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, he {{received}} a MacArthur Fellowship and, since the early 1990s <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been frequently cited as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. American literary critic Harold Bloom named {{him as one of}} the four major American novelists of his time, along with Don DeLillo, Philip Roth, and Cormac McCarthy.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015 British lawmaker John McDonnell said, [...] "The case of Shaker Aamer {{is one of}} {{the worst}} cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in the last three decades <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ... <b>He</b> <b>has</b> endured harsh, and brutal and inhuman treatment," [...] in a debate in which members of all major political parties called for Aamer's release.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 2014, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{been working}} for Hillary Clinton´s 2016 presidential {{campaign}} in Iowa.|$|R
60|$|Next morning, as I went to {{the early}} fishing, Chigwooltz, the patient, sat by the same stone, his fore feet {{at the edge of}} the same bronze lily leaf. At noon he was still there; in twenty-four hours <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not moved a muscle.|$|E
60|$|Cordemais was {{the name}} of the {{original}} Scaramouche, who had so unfortunately twisted his ankle. That Binet should refer to him by his secular designation was a sign that in the Binet company <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fallen for ever from the lofty eminence of Scaramouche.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{should think}} she was not," [...] said the girl, gravely. She looked hurt, {{as if she had}} been unfairly forced to the logic of her postulate, and Hewson was not {{altogether}} pleased with himself; but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had his revenge in making her realize the man's vacuity.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must go," [...] I said. [...] "Our team is {{freezing}} and we can't {{afford to lose}} it;" [...] and Minnie, touching her father, said, [...] "You should thank Mr. Lorimer. Forty miles <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> driven to-day, and there's another fifteen before him;" [...] but ere he could turn I bundled Harry out of the door, and two minutes later we were flying across the prairie.|$|R
50|$|By 1901 {{and until}} <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1926 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> offices first at 22 and later at 28 Park Row, Nottingham.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 2011, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{continued}} to record and release new music from his current hometown of Los Angeles.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Bakery's closed, y'reince!" [...] the Chancellor said, more {{loudly and}} clearly {{than he had}} spoken yet. He was emboldened by the {{consciousness}} that here, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> evidence to produce: and he placed in the Warden's hands a few printed notices, that were lying ready, with some open ledgers, on a side-table.|$|E
60|$|A wave of morbid introspection {{swept over}} her soul. She {{realised}} {{in a moment}} how petty and base had been her thoughts and how purposeless her actions. She would have given her life at this moment to eradicate from Déroulède's mind the knowledge of her own jealousy; she hoped that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not guessed her love.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour Paris was behind them. They were {{traveling}} in a royal saloon and at a fabuulous cost, for in France they are not fond of special trains. But Mr. Sabin was very happy. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> escaped an ignominious defeat. It was left to him to play the great card.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give it!" [...] advised Ukridge. [...] "Couldn't do better. A very sound fellow. Pots of money, too. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> will <b>have</b> when <b>he</b> marries." ...|$|R
60|$|Better {{would it}} have been for him, perhaps, could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> kept his courage; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> been spared much added shame and misery.|$|R
60|$|Tibbs acquiesced, {{wondering}} in his {{own mind}} what the deuce the other could have done, and imagining that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> must <b>have</b> broken the best decanters.|$|R
60|$|He drew {{a little}} sigh of relief--he, who very seldom {{permitted}} himself {{the luxury of}} even the slightest revelation of his feelings. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a start. Then he unlocked a travelling case, and, drawing out an atlas, sat with it upon his knee for some time. When he closed it there was a frown upon his face.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} to rest and recover himself, with the comforting inner {{conviction}} that, in one respect <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gained his point. The furious savage, with the eyes that darted fire and the fist that threatened destruction, was a total stranger to him. In other words, not {{the man who had}} passed as the lady's husband at the inn.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he started}} to walk back to his apartment. He walked very quickly, with clenched hands. He was {{wondering}} if after all there was not {{something to be said}} for the methods of the caveman when he went a-wooing. Twinges of conscience the caveman may have had when all was over, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> established his right to look after the woman he loved.|$|E
5000|$|Indiocine's Macky Macarayan {{found some}} of the {{characters}} confusing, and believes a traditional ending featuring the narrator would have served the film better. But he praises the film for being a very honest social commentary, calling it [...] "raw, uninhibited, and unforgiving". [...] "Everything is exaggerated, meant as an inverse, or metaphorically presented. Subtlety is not in Khavn's vocabulary; he likes to confront the issues head on, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> some style. Like Nolan's Inception you have to dig further." ...|$|R
50|$|The Apollinarists, {{denying that}} Christ had a human soul, or, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a human intellect (nous), {{necessarily}} regarded him as devoid of knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 2009, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been {{primarily}} playing aluminum guitars from The Electrical Guitar Company, {{citing a}} preference in {{size of the}} fretboard and general tone.|$|R
