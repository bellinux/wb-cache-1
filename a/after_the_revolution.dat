5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> was quelled, the old flags were {{restored}} and the revolutionaries punished for having worn the tricolor. In 1849, domnitor Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei adopted a new design for military colors that nevertheless preserved the colors’ horizontal layout and only changed decorative elements. Similar to the 1834 flag, this one lasted until 1856.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the crucial}} events of the American Revolution {{occurred}} in or near Boston, including the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's midnight ride, the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston, and many others. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Boston's long seafaring tradition helped make {{it one of the}} world's wealthiest international ports, with the slave trade, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being particularly important.|$|E
5|$|The current Romanian {{reconnaissance}} battalions (the 313th, the 317th and the 528th) {{are also}} considered special forces units, and were {{formed in the}} 1960s during the communist regime. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution,</b> the units suffered {{from a lack of}} funds which resulted in the temporary disbandment of the 313th Battalion. However, their equipment was completely overhauled {{in the past few years}} and the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. The work was {{undertaken}} by the La Villéons in the romantic style that accompanied the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Boone resettled in Limestone (renamed Maysville, Kentucky in 1786), then {{a booming}} Ohio River port. In 1787, {{he was elected}} to the Virginia state {{assembly}} as a representative from Bourbon County. In Maysville, he kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. He was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. Boone became a celebrity while living in Maysville. In 1784, on his 50th birthday, historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement And present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> in Russia in 1917, the {{communist}} movement gradually gained footholds {{in many countries}} around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it began to fall. Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E

5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were {{better able to}} create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{defeat in}} World War I, Hipper retired on 13 December 1918 from {{the navy and}} lived a quiet life; he {{received}} a full war pension. During {{the chaos of the}} German Revolution of 1918–1919, Hipper hid from radical revolutionaries by assuming a false name and moving frequently. He wrote a letter to Adolf von Trotha, the new fleet commander, expressing his approval of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> was over, Hipper moved to a house in Altona near Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Norfolk {{was burned}} down during the Revolutionary War. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Norfolk was rebuilt in the Federal style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, {{though they had}} more refined decorations to look like New World homes. Federal homes had {{features}} such as narrow sidelights with an embracing fanlight around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling off American coasts was {{an issue}} before the Revolutionary War, and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution</b> of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm {{became the}} first duke of Urach. A passionate {{artillery}} officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers {{in the style of}} the imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not on a scale as grand) and a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls. From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. A motion to build a cableway up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would ruin the beauty of the castle.|$|E
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolutions</b> of 1848 in the Austrian Empire {{a modern}} {{municipal}} division {{was introduced in}} the re-established Austrian Silesia. The town became a seat of a legal district at first in Friedek and since 1868 in the Freistadt political district.|$|R

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Prokofiev left Russia {{with the}} {{official}} blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. During that time he married a Spanish singer, Carolina Codina, {{with whom he had}} two sons. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to Soviet Russia for commissions of new music; in 1936 he finally returned to his homeland with his family. He enjoyed some success there – notably with Lieutenant Kijé, Peter and the Wolf, Romeo and Juliet, and perhaps above all with Alexander Nevsky.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the French in the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Belgium came under Dutch rule. The Belgian Revolution, which broke out on 25 August 1830 after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, was inspired to some extent by the Brabant Revolution. The day <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> broke out, revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by the colours chosen by the Brabant Revolution of 1789. The colours (red, yellow and black) today form the national flag of Belgium. Some historians have also argued that the Vonckists and Statists were the forerunners of the major political factions, the Liberals and the Catholics, which would dominate Belgian politics after independence.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as {{provisional}} {{president of}} {{what became the}} Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion {{was in favor of}} it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers. Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.|$|E
