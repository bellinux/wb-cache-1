40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine the extent to which students who are completing planned curricula in mathematics education are proficient in spatial visualization abilities and possess mathematical understandings. The effects of mathematics curricula upon the development <b>of</b> these <b>abilities</b> and understandings and the relationships between these abilities and understandings were examined by comparing group mean test scores of prospective elementary and secondary mathematics teachers with those of (a) prospective social science teachers, (b) prospective English teachers, (c) prospective science teachers, (d) prospective art/industrial arts teachers, (e) freshman mathematics students, (f) experienced elementary mathematics teachers, and (g) experienced secondary mathematics teachers. Criterion tests were the Differential Aptitude Test of Space Relations, Form A, (DATSR), the Revised Minnesota Paper Form Board Test, Series MB, (MPFB), and the Sequential Test of Educational Progress-Mathematics, Form 1 B, (STEPM). The study being of a post-test-only design, the criterion instruments were administered to the freshman students at the beginning of Fall Term 1964. Prospective teachers completed the tests during the term in which they were enrolled in their respective special teaching methods courses. Single classification of analysis of covariance using DATSR, MPFB, and STEPM group means was employed to statistically test the null hypotheses. Means of combined verbal and mathematical sub-test scores on the Washington Pre-College Tests were applied as covariance controls of scholastic aptitude, and group mean cumulative grade-point-averages were similarly used to control group differences in academic ability. F ratios were computed and evaluated to determine whether differences in group means on the criterion instruments were significant. The data were further analyzed to determine correlations between the variables and other curricula data. Reliability coefficients for the criterion instruments were computed for each group involved in the study. FINDINGS: The following conclusions relative to students at Central Washington State College were drawn from the data obtained and analyzed in this investigation: 1. The spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective elementary mathematics teachers are significantly different from similar <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> experienced elementary mathematics teachers, while the spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective secondary mathematics teachers do not differ significantly. 2. Spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective secondary mathematics teachers and experienced elementary mathematics teachers are significantly different, as are the similar <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective elementary mathematics teachers and experienced secondary mathematics teachers. 3. The spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective elementary mathematics teachers are not significantly different from similar <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective teachers in other academic fields of endeavor involved in the study, except in the field of science. 4. Spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective secondary mathematics teachers are significantly different from similar <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective teachers of social sciences and prospective teachers of English, but are not significantly different from spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective teachers of art/industrial arts or prospective teachers of science. 5. Prospective secondary mathematics teachers have a significantly different degree of development <b>of</b> spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> than do prospective elementary mathematics teachers. It would appear, based on the means of the collected data, that the former group has a higher degree of development. 6. The spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> first-quarter freshman mathematics students are significantly different from similar <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective elementary mathematics teachers but are no different from these same <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective secondary mathematics teachers. 7. Mathematics achievement can be used, at significant levels of confidence, as a valid index <b>of</b> spatial visualization <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> prospective teachers in several academic fields, freshman mathematics students, and experienced elementary and secondary mathematics teachers. 8. There is no significant dependence of a teacher's spatial visualization abilities on his scholastic ability. This is also true for the first-quarter freshman mathematics students...|$|R
