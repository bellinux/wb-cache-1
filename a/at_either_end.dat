5|$|Occasionally, Ganapati and {{his brother}} Kartikeya (Kumara, Subramanya) or the saktis, the female counterparts, can be found <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of this carving. Carvings of the river Goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are found <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of {{the foot of the}} doorway to the shrine in early temples.|$|E
5|$|Prolate: This is an {{icosahedron}} elongated {{along the}} fivefold axis {{and is a}} common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages. This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5|$|No light armor {{was fitted}} above the main belt or <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the ship. This made Texas highly {{vulnerable}} to rapid-fire guns using high-explosive shells. This {{was not considered}} a significant threat at the time Texas was designed but would become so within a few years.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} have beige windscreens {{and brown}} canopies with green frames at their center and waist-high black steel fences <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b> They are offset as the Manhattan-bound platform {{is more to}} the north than the Coney Island-bound one and both have electrical distribution rooms <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{association}} relationships, {{which can}} have different semantics <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends,</b> different actions {{can be specified}} for <b>either</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Several rowing clubs <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> of the lake, {{specifically}} 2014 APSMRC Park South Melbourne, Caulfield Grammar School, Argonauts, YWCA, Korowa GS, Wesley College, Brighton Grammar School.|$|R
5|$|The older {{part of the}} brick-built hall {{consists}} of seven bays, over two floors. There are projecting bays <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the building, dressed with ashlar quoins. A central doorway is flanked with plain pilasters, also of ashlar. The roof is of a hipped design, with a central octagonal bellcote, topped by a small dome.|$|E
5|$|Ascospores are {{ellipsoidal}} in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with {{dimensions of}} 17–22 by 7–9µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end.</b> The spore-producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17|µm. The {{diameter of the}} club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10µm at the apex.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become, since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections.|$|E
5000|$|Newell [...] {{proposed}} an exact method {{to solve the}} kinematic wave equation based on cumulative curves only <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> of the corridor, without evaluating any intermediate points.|$|R
25|$|The {{city has}} many fountains. The Place Marcadieu and Place Verdun {{reproduce}} the same pattern: They each have two fountains spread <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> {{and not in}} the middle.|$|R
50|$|The North Island has {{a larger}} {{population}} than the South Island {{with both the}} country's largest city, Auckland {{as well as the}} capital, Wellington <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> of the island.|$|R
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads {{on their hands}} and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} more space, he added blocks <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the frontage, and galleried wings {{on either side of}} the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in the 1850s as part of the Opeongo and Ottawa Colonization Road, {{providing}} access to Renfrew County for settlement in the Opeongo Hills. However, it did not become a provincial highway until 1956. Aside from the change in number of the highways <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the route, the route has remained the same since then.|$|E
50|$|This {{elevated}} station, {{opened on}} December 28, 1906, has two tracks and two offset side platforms. The platforms have windscreens and canopies at their centers and woven-wire fences with dark gray steel frames <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|Above the {{platforms}} is {{a full-length}} mezzanine {{that connects the}} two station entrances <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b> It has more staircases to the Jamaica-bound platform than the Manhattan-bound one due to a crew office built on the Manhattan-bound side.|$|R
50|$|However, on some single tracked {{lines the}} {{timetables}} may be 30/30 or 60/60 minutes, {{with the actual}} timetables being asymmetrical (such as 20/40 minutes), because passing loops are not positioned ideally, or alternate connections <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> have to be reached.|$|R
5|$|The smooth spores {{are roughly}} elliptical, {{measuring}} 8–14 by 3–5μm; in maturity {{they have one}} cross-wall, and oil drops <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end.</b> The asci (spore-bearing cells) measure 100–135 by 7–10μm. The paraphyses are shaped liked narrow cylinders with diameters up to 1.5μm, and have tips that are rounded or somewhat club-shaped. β-Carotene is the predominant pigment responsible for the yellow color of the fruit body.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot {{in order to protect}} himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} a {{mezzanine}} above the tracks at the Southern end and platforms that connect both fare control areas <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b> There are five staircases to each platform and large-scale photos of Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports a}} type II Salter and Harris injury <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> of the {{clavicle}} in a 13 -year-old child with postero-inferior displacement at the lateral and antero-superior displacement at the medial {{end of the}} clavicle shaft. He was treated in a shoulder immobilizer. The mechanism of injury is postulated as pivoting of the clavicle on the first rib with shearing <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> leading to a bipolar injury. The brachial plexus and subclavian vessels are at a risk of damage at the pivot as they lie in close vicinity to the first rib. In view of the intact periosteal sleeve as well as joint articulation at both ends, the fracture healed with no functional loss...|$|R
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have beige windscreens {{along their}} entire lengths and brown canopies with green frames and support columns {{except for a}} small section <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b> Platform signs display 80 Street - Hudson Street, which was the original name of this station.|$|R
5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections. It is usual to provide half half-sections at the ends of the filter with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination.|$|E
5|$|Mir was {{authorized}} on a 17 February 1976 decree, to design an improved {{model of the}} Salyut DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during Mirs development. It was planned that the station's core module (DOS-7 and the backup DOS-8) would be equipped {{with a total of}} four docking ports; two <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere {{at the front of the}} station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.|$|E
5|$|On {{the five}} pendentives along each {{side and the}} two <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> Michelangelo painted the largest figures on the ceiling: twelve people who prophesied or {{represented}} {{some aspect of the}} Coming of Christ. Of those twelve, seven were Prophets of Israel and were male. The remaining five were prophets of the Classical World, called Sibyls and were female. The prophet Jonah is placed above the altar and Zechariah at the further end. The other male and female figures alternate down each side, each being identified by an inscription on a painted marble panel supported by a putto.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} are narrower <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> {{than in the}} middle, {{where the}} station's exits {{are on the same}} level and the station columns are. The columns are dark blue colored I-beams and every other column has the standard black and white name tablet.|$|R
50|$|This {{elevated}} {{station has}} three tracks and two side platforms. Both platforms have beige windscreens and mesh fences and red canopies with green frames and support columns {{in the center}} and white steel waist-level fences <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> with white lampposts at regular intervals.|$|R
50|$|This {{elevated}} station, {{opened on}} December 28, 1906 and renovated in 2005-2006, has two side platforms and two tracks. Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies in their centers and barb wired fences <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b> They are all supported by green frames.|$|R
5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The main structure had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and an infusion of extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> and each is driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine. In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E
5|$|The main {{components}} of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which five smaller ones are each framed and supported by four naked youths or Ignudi. <b>At</b> <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have cream-colored windscreens and red canopies. Both platforms {{also have}} green outlines, frames and support columns, in their center and green waist-high, ornament-style steel fences <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> with several lampposts. The station's signs {{are in the}} standard black name plates with white Helvetica lettering.|$|R
50|$|This {{elevated}} {{station has}} two island platforms and three tracks {{with the center}} track not normally used. Except for small sections <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends,</b> both platforms have brown canopies with green frames and support columns for the entire length. The un-canopied areas have black station sign structures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{platforms}} were extended <b>at</b> <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> in 1964-1965 {{to accommodate}} the current standard IRT train length of 510 feet. Here, they have signs reading [...] "KINGSTON AVE" [...] in white sans serif lettering on a black border. There is a vent chamber on the lower level.|$|R
