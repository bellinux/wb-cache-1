5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 phase and S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} <b>anaphase</b> promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
5|$|Components of the RNAi pathway {{are used}} in many eukaryotes in the {{maintenance}} of the organization and structure of their genomes. Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre-transcriptionally; this process is referred to as RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function. As a consequence, the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins. Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and centromere formation, causing slow or stalled <b>anaphase</b> during cell division. In some cases, similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the <b>anaphase</b> of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E

40|$|Cytotoxicity {{of metals}} is {{important}} because some metals are potential mutagens able to induce tumors in humans and experimental animals. Chromium can damage DNA in several ways, including DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) which generate chromosomal aberrations, micronucleus formation, sister chromatid exchange, formation of DNA adducts and alterations in DNA replication and transcription. In our study, water samples from three sites in the Córrego dos Bagres stream in the Franca municipality of the Brazilian state of São Paulo were subjected to the comet assay and micronucleus test using erythrocytes from the fish Oreochromis niloticus. Nuclear abnormalities of the erythrocytes included blebbed, notched and lobed nuclei, probably due to genotoxic chromium compounds. The greatest comet assay damage occurred with water from a chromium-containing tannery effluent discharge site, supporting the hypothesis that chromium residues can be genotoxic. The mutagenicity of the water samples was assessed using the onion root-tip cell assay, the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities observed being: c-metaphases, stick chromosome, chromosome breaks and losses, bridged <b>anaphases,</b> multipolar <b>anaphases,</b> and micronucleated and binucleated cells.

25|$|The genetic {{composition}} of the offspring depends on what type of apomixis takes place.

40|$|AbstractSpo 76 p is conserved {{and related}} to the fungal {{proteins}} Pds 5 p and BIMD and the human AS 3 prostate proliferative shutoff-associated protein. Spo 76 p localizes to mitotic and meiotic chromosomes, except at metaphase(s) and <b>anaphase(s).</b> During meiotic prophase, Spo 76 p assembles into strong lines in correlation with axial element formation. As inferred from spo 76 - 1 mutant phenotypes, Spo 76 p is required for sister chromatid cohesiveness, chromosome axis morphogenesis, and chromatin condensation during critical transitions at mitotic prometaphase and meiotic midprophase. Spo 76 p is also required for meiotic interhomolog recombination, likely at postinitiation stage(s). We propose that a disruptive force coordinately promotes chromosomal axial compaction and destabilization of sister connections and that Spo 76 p restrains and channels {{the effects of this}} force into appropriate morphogenetic mitotic and meiotic outcomes...|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} mitosis {{is complex and}} highly regulated. The {{sequence}} of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities {{and the start of}} the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, <b>anaphase</b> and telophase. During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in cytokinesis, to produce two identical daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|Another motor protein {{implicated in}} the initial capture of MTs is CENP-E; this is a high {{molecular}} weight kinesin associated with the fibrous corona at mammalian kinetochores from prometaphase until <b>anaphase.</b> In cells {{with low levels of}} CENP-E, chromosomes lack this protein at their kinetochores, which quite often are defective in their ability to congress at the metaphase plate. In this case, some chromosomes may remain chronically mono-oriented (anchored to only one pole), although most chromosomes may congress correctly at the metaphase plate.|$|E
25|$|Chromosomes are {{normally}} visible under a light microscope {{only when the}} cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division. Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting in an X-shaped structure. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in <b>anaphase</b> during segregation.|$|E
40|$|Endopolyploidy arises during normal {{development}} in many species when cells undergo endocycles—variant cell cycles in which DNA replicates but daughter cells do not form. Normally, polyploid cells do not divide mitotically after initiating endocycles; hence, {{little is known}} about their mitotic competence. However, polyploid cells are found in many tumors, and the enhanced chromosomal instability of polyploid cells in culture suggests that such cells contribute to tumor aneuploidy. Here, we describe a novel polyploid Drosophila cell type that undergoes normal mitotic cycles as part of a remodeling process that forms the adult rectal papillae. Similar polyploid mitotic divisions, but not depolyploidizing divisions, were observed during adult ileum {{development in}} the mosquito Culex pipiens. Extended <b>anaphases,</b> chromosome bridges, and lagging chromosomes were frequent during these polyploid divisions, despite normal expression of cell cycle regulators. Our results show that the switch to endocycles during development is not irreversible, but argue that the polyploid mitotic cycle is inherently error-prone, and that polyploid mitoses may help destabilize the cancer genome...|$|R

Androgens have different effects at different follicles: they stimulate IGF-1 at facial hair, leading to growth, but can also stimulate TGF β1, TGF β2, dickkopf1, and IL-6 at the scalp, leading to catagenic miniaturization.

25|$|When a cell enters in mitosis, it duplicates all {{the genetic}} {{information}} {{stored in the}} chromosomes, in the process termed DNA replication.

Both chromatids remain associated by cohesin complexes until <b>anaphase,</b> when chromosome segregation occurs. If chromosome segregation happens correctly, each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromatids, and for this to happen each sister chromatid has to anchor (through the corresponding kinetochore) to MTs generated in opposed poles of the mitotic spindle. This configuration is termed amphitelic or bi-orientation.|$|E
25|$|At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels {{decreases}} 3 to 4 fold {{as compared}} to the levels at unattached kinetochores, whereas the levels of dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 decrease >10-100 fold. Thus at metaphase, when all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, all checkpoint proteins are released from the kinetochore. The disappearance of the checkpoint proteins out of the kinetochores indicates the moment when the chromosome has reached the metaphase plate and is under bipolar tension. At this moment, the checkpoint proteins that bind to and inhibit Cdc20 (Mad1-Mad2 and BubR1), release Cdc20, which binds and activates APC/CCdc20, and this complex triggers sister chromatids separation and consequently <b>anaphase</b> entry.|$|E
