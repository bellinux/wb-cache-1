50|$|Councilwoman Melinda Katz {{sought to}} change the minimum <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>entry</b> into bars from 16 to 18 years of age. Ron Bookman, who {{represented}} the New York Nightlife Association, then accused Katz of grandstanding and predicted that her legislation would never get beyond the draft stage. Bookman wanted all the legislators to attend the summit hearing in September 2006.

50|$|Members of the U.S. Congress tend to {{be older}} than parliamentarians {{elsewhere}} in the English-speaking world, a main factor being that the minimum <b>ages</b> <b>for</b> members of Congress is written into Article One of the United States Constitution, which forbids persons {{under the age of}} 25 from serving in the House and persons under the age of 30 from serving in the Senate. Moreover, election to the federal Congress is expensive and requires extensive contacts and recognition across a very wide area.

30|$|Compulsory {{education}} systems usually specify a cutoff date regulating the precise <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>entry</b> into primary school. Existing literature from the USA and Europe {{has demonstrated that}} children born just before the cutoff date are disadvantaged in academic performance and has formalized this phenomenon as the “age position effect.” A recent study by Liu and Li (Sociol Stud 6 : 169 – 245, 2015) reported similar findings for China. Our study, however, challenges Liu and Li’s conclusion by examining {{the long-term effects of}} birth month on socioeconomic attainment and the compliance rate regarding the cutoff date. Using the 2005 1 % Mini-census Survey and the 1992 National Sample Survey of the Living Situation of Chinese Children, we found a significant variation in socioeconomic achievement by birth month in adulthood in ways that differ from those reported by Liu and Li. In addition, we found compliance to be affected by both birth month and parental characteristics. In conclusion, our article proposes parental self-selection as an alternative explanation for the cutoff date effect.|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} with the age-at-test effect, other researchers argue for an effect of absolute <b>age</b> <b>for</b> school <b>entry.</b> They argue that children may not be prepared cognitively, physically, and psychologically for formal learning in school unless they reach a certain absolute age. The higher level of school readiness among older children benefits them not only in their initial adaptation to school but also in learning in later grades. As a result, older children always end up with more human capital. Supporters of both the relative age effect and the absolute age effect agree that children born after the cutoff date benefit from {{a higher level of}} maturity, but they differ in whether their advantage derived from a higher level of maturity at the initial stage persists into later life (Elder and Lubotsky 2009). This debate is largely empirical, and the existing findings are mixed and inconclusive.|$|R

30|$|This {{definition}} omits integration requirements {{revolving around}} economic criteria (other than fees for integration courses and tests). These include, for example, demands that immigrants must {{have achieved a}} certain employment record, be self-supporting, or have a certain income level or education. This ‘neo-liberal’ or social-democratic good citizen (e.g. Joppke, 2007 b, p. 248) is a crucial component in policy changes in many family reunification regulations (as it is in changes to residence and naturalization rules). Another crucial aspect of recent family migration policy changes in many European countries is the introduction of stricter <b>age</b> requirements <b>for</b> spousal <b>entry</b> (higher than the legal marriage <b>age</b> <b>for</b> resident spouses) and <b>for</b> <b>entry</b> of children (in Denmark, low enough to allow integration), and blocks to those with domestic violence records. We argue {{that this type of}} requirement, though not tracked by Goodman’s civic integration definition (and index) is part of the larger civic integration trend in requiring newcomers to already have, or have potential to achieve, civic maturity. In Scandinavia this is understood to extend even to specific civic values and norms of family- and work-life related to gender equality and (women’s) individual autonomy.|$|R
30|$|The Compulsory Education Law {{regulates the}} timing of school entry by setting a legal minimum age at which {{children}} can begin school and an enrollment cutoff date. It sets age 6 as the eligible age, but it allows age 7 as the threshold for less-developed regions. In practice, the choice of 6 or 7 as the minimum <b>age</b> <b>for</b> school <b>entry</b> was made by local governments at the city level. During the initial years of the law’s enactment, age 7 was widely chosen as the threshold in most provinces, but the threshold gradually moved to age 6 as most provinces amended the rules for implementation after 2000. The details of the Compulsory Education Law specify that children become eligible <b>for</b> school <b>entry</b> when they reach the legal minimum age {{before the beginning of}} the school year. Since September 1 is officially the first day of the school year across the country, August 31 is the nationwide cutoff date. In principle, children who have reached their 6 th (or 7 th) birthday before August 31 should immediately be enrolled in primary school on September 1 of the same year, while those born that year but after August 31 should wait until the following school year.|$|R
40|$|Delay their start? Let them try, {{and maybe}} repeat kinder-garten?

Once it was standard practice to require kindergartners entering in September to have turned five by the following December or January; now {{it has become increasingly}} common for schools to require that children have turned five by Septem-ber or October.

25|$|In 1906, {{children}} {{were provided with}} free school meals. However, many local councils ignored this system, as it was not compulsory for them to provide the free meals and {{the cost to the}} council was far greater than was subsidised for. The provision of free school meals was made compulsory in 1914, in which year fourteen million meals per school day were served (compared with nine million per school day in 1910), most of which were free. In 1912, half of all councils in Britain were offering the scheme. Recruitment for the Second Boer War demonstrated the undernourishment and illness among the working classes, and there were fears over future generations being unable to maintain military control of Britain's empire. Also, following an unfavourable report by the Board of Education's inspectors on infant education in 1906, school provision for children under five was restricted (previously, the normal <b>age</b> <b>for</b> the <b>entry</b> of working-class children into full-time education had been three). In 1907, the Notification of Births Act came into being, which sought to quantify and analyse the causes of (and ultimately further reduce) infant mortality.|$|R
50|$|Uganda {{has seven}} years of primary {{education}} and the legal <b>age</b> <b>for</b> school <b>entry</b> is six (Moyi 3). According to the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) statistics, school enrollments increased from 3 million to 5.3 million in 1997 and the number rapidly increased to 7 million by 2004 (Kakura 137). Even though the increased number of pupils was perceived as a good thing, there were only 125,883 teachers, breaking the UPE required pupil-teacher ratio of 1:40 (Kakura 138). The large number of pupils makes the learning environment more difficult and it becomes harder {{for the teacher to}} be heard and teach. According to Arbeiter and Hartley, classes have between 70 and 150 pupils and there is over-age studying in all schools. Moyi explains the issue of many classes having the inappropriate age of pupils to be driven by the late enrollment or grade repetition, which in turn is caused by the poor quality of education (8). For instance, “third grade included pupils aged between seven to sixteen years and in sixth grade there were pupils up to nineteen years of age” (Moyi 66).|$|R

While there is a popular image of EU staff as over-paid, new employees may find this image hard to square with their own experience. Firstly, salaries and other benefits have been much reduced following a 2004 package of staff reforms; while salaries are relatively attractive to staff coming from new member states, the same cannot be said for many EU10 member state employees. This situation is aggravated by the EU refusal to recognise more than a minimal level of work experience earned outside the institutions, a particularly malign policy given that the average <b>age</b> of <b>entry</b> <b>for</b> AD5 ('graduate-level') staff in the Commission is 34 years old (2009 Commission Human Resources Report).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} UK’s legal {{interventions}} {{in the arena}} of forced marriage. Three key initiatives have been considered in the last 5 years: creating a specific crime of forced marriage; civil rather than criminal protection for victims; and an increase in the <b>age</b> of <b>entry</b> <b>for</b> non-EU spouses, with a corresponding increase in <b>age</b> <b>for</b> sponsoring such spouses. Our key focus is on the last of these interventions and we draw upon a research study conducted in the UK in 2006 / 2007 exploring the risks and benefits associated with increasing the age of sponsorship and entry. The UK government’s argument is that the increased maturity which comes from being older acts as a protective factor, thus making it easier to resist forced marriage. This view of maturity gains its saliency from developmental psychology. Here, we critically analyse the construct of age and the link between age and ability to resist forced marriage. We illustrate through the accounts of victims of forced marriage and of stakeholders the difficulties of adopting age as a central organising feature of protection for potential victims of forced marriage...|$|R
