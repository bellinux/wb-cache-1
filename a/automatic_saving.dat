Introduction Our ALPS {{theme is}} "The Symbiosis Strategy of Embedded Systems Development between Japan and Vietnam –beyond Offshore Outsourcing–". The {{purpose of our}} ALPS project is to {{investigate}} the critical factors and craft strategic management {{which leads to the}} rapid growth in terms of development volume of offshore business. It is necessary to share a system development environment and a communication tool. And it is also necessary to share a common mental to run the projects in the long-term relationship. 1. 2. Roadmaps First, in order to find issues of the actual embedded system development, we determined the interviewees on the basis of CVCA. After interviewing with the stakeholders, we grouped the acquired knowledge by related category using the Mind Map and the KJ method. Secondly, we materialized the functions of the system to solve the critical issues using morphological analysis. Additionally from this interview, we thought that communication issue such as the difference in language was a critical issue, and devised the teleconference system as the solutions. We interviewed with the stakeholders again after prototype preparation to validate the developed our system. From this interview, we obtained the positive feedback of the proto type and also found some lacks to solve whole the issues. Whereat, we came up with the new system ideas "Internal SNS" and "Model-driven architecture" which cover the shortcomings. 1. 3. Symbio-SYS-tem Through analysis, we proposed a new system named "Symbio-SYS-tem". We aim at "haring the recognition between outsourcers and subcontractors" by the Symbio-SYS-tem. The Symbio-SYS-tem consists of three subsystems, Teleconference room, Internal SNS, Model-Driven Development. The Teleconference room's functions, wide screens and constant connection, give the engineers of both companies visual information to share atmosphere of each companies in Japan and Vietnam, and the other functions of displaying the same document, hand writing by tablet computer and <b>automatic</b> <b>saving</b> to a repository helps them to communicate easily by sharing the same documents and tracing contents of their meetings. The Internal SNS is a platform on website to get information of projects such as the member's names, faces and skills and the schedule, progress and documents. It also becomes a network to connect with the members related to projects by visualizing the connection among engineers and chatting with them. The third subsystem, the Model-Driven Development is that engineers create models of products' structure along the process with a modeling language like SysML or OPM. It gives the engineers the same diagrams and system overview they develop. They can solve the problems such as ambiguity of natural languages, miss-translations of specifications and incompleteness of specifications because of these functions. Each subsystem shall be effective by itself. However, it is more effective when we use the three subsystems in combination such as at a teambuilding phase or order phase. 1. 4. Future work Before we launch it to market, we have to do the following things; fist we should make the interfaces between 3 factors clear to use in combination. Also, we have to mention the strategic management to use the system as manual documents, and finally verify and validate this system in actual work though we received favorable reviews about it from the proposers and the professors. In addition, we need to make the contingency plan. In case of that the internet cannot use, the system is not going to work. We have to include the management contents for the case and educate the engineers in both companies...|$|E
