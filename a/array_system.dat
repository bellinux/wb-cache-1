500|$|Jackson {{was working}} as an {{entrepreneur}} in digital audio electronics in 1993 when Barbra Streisand's producer asked him to mix her first concert tour in decades. Jackson signed on partly because he was assured he could {{do anything to make}} her concert sound as good as possible. Jackson determined that huge concert venues such as Wembley Stadium and Madison Square Garden would be carpeted for Streisand, and that expensive heavy drapes would be hung at the walls to damp sound reflections. After discovering that Streisand did not like to listen to any stage monitors made after the 1960s, he designed a stage wedge which used soft dome drivers for midrange and for high frequencies rather than the more powerful compression drivers in common use after the 1970s. As well, the main sound system Jackson specified was a new design by Clair Brothers, a proprietary line <b>array</b> <b>system</b> called the I4. Streisand was not willing to wear in-ear monitors but the band was fitted with them, to reduce stage wash and make the band's instruments stand out better individually in the mix. The stage monitors, line array and extravagant acoustic treatments were a hit with Streisand, who said of Jackson that he was [...] "the best sound engineer in the world." ...|$|E

[...] The SSC {{is an attempt}} by the Navy to increase the LCS' firepower and protection. [...] Although Austal submitted improvements including vertical launch systems, 76mm guns, and advanced combat systems and sensors, the Navy opted to keep the 57mm gun, not add a VLS, and chose to add an upgraded 3-D radar. [...] Other changes included installation of an unspecified over-the-horizon missile, Mark 38 25 mm guns, a torpedo countermeasures system, a multifunction towed <b>array</b> <b>system,</b> installation the SeaRAM launcher (on the Freedom-class), an upgraded countermeasures decoy system, an upgraded electronic warfare system, armor added to vital spaces, and improved signature management. [...] The SSC will focus on SUW and ASW with these additions, as well as retaining all other features of their mission packages; the SSC is not required to perform MCM, which will continue to be handled by the LCS. [...] The vessels will retain a degree of modularity to concentrate on one mission set and will still have mission bays, although they may be reduced. [...] SSC vessels are planned to begin procurement by 2019, and it is being investigated if the enhancements can be added to existing LCS hulls.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} antenna <b>array</b> <b>systems</b> has been mainly focused to arrays of elements with linear or planar array geometries. However, in many modern array applications, antenna array geometries may span the full 3 D space, and may be used in scenarios where signals are impinging from any direction in that space. In this paper, new theoretical tools for analysing the detection and resolution capabilities of 3 D arrays are developed based on the geometric properties of the array manifold. Furthermore, a new type of ambiguities for 3 D arrays is presented, complementing the introduction to the {{analysis of}} the most general case of <b>array</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Phased <b>array</b> radar <b>systems</b> {{are also}} used by {{warships}} of many navies. Because of the rapidity with which the beam can be steered, phased array radars allow a warship to use one radar system for surface detection and tracking (finding ships), air detection and tracking (finding aircraft and missiles) and missile uplink capabilities. Before using these systems, each surface-to-air missile in flight required a dedicated fire-control radar, which meant that ships could only engage {{a small number of}} simultaneous targets. Phased <b>array</b> <b>systems</b> can be used to control missiles during the mid-course phase of the missile's flight. During the terminal portion of the flight, continuous-wave fire control directors provide the final guidance to the target. Because the radar beam is electronically steered, phased <b>array</b> <b>systems</b> can direct radar beams fast enough to maintain a fire control quality track on many targets simultaneously while also controlling several in-flight missiles.|$|R
