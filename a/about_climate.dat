5|$|Despite these challenges, green {{marketing}} {{has continued}} to gain adherents, {{particularly in light of}} growing global concern <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> change. This concern has led more companies to advertise their commitment to reduce their climate impacts, and the effect this is having on their products and services.|$|E

5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand is a non-fiction book <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> change denial, coauthored by Haydn Washington and John Cook, with a {{foreword}} by Naomi Oreskes. Washington had {{a background}} in environmental science prior to authoring the work, and Cook was educated in physics and founded the website Skeptical Science which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of global warming. The book {{was first published in}} hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by Earthscan, a division of Routledge.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, The Washington Post {{linked with}} {{approval}} to Romm's {{review of the}} scientific literature on climate change. Time magazine explored Romm's critique of Matthew Nisbet and praised {{his analysis of the}} decline of media coverage regarding climate change. National Geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address. In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear, and Current TV's Bill Press interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} {{an active}} climate protection policy and {{was instrumental in}} the passing of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and in founding the Hadley Centre for Climate Research and Prediction. She helped to put climate change, acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the late 1980s, and in 1989 she called for a global treaty on climate change. Her speeches included one to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988 and to the UN General Assembly in November 1989. However, following her retirement as Prime Minister in 1990, she became sceptical <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> change policy and rejected climate alarmism.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The Nature of Things in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E

40|$|Predictions <b>about</b> future <b>climate</b> are {{typically}} {{based on an}} ensemble of evaluations of a climate model at different parameterisations. If we wish to describe our uncertainty <b>about</b> future <b>climate</b> in terms of probabilities, then this constrains {{the way in which}} such an ensemble is generated and used. A key part of the process is a probabilistic description {{of the way in which}} evaluations of the climate model are informative <b>about</b> the <b>climate</b> system. Or, to put it more starkly, a probabilistic description of the model’s inadequacy as a representation of climate. This paper describes the probabilistic approach, and makes a number of suggestions in order to simplify the challenging task of specifying this description of model inadequacy, to make the calculations more tractable, and to improve the quality of the resulting probability estimates...|$|R
