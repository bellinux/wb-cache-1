50|$|These are two {{principal}} methods {{by which the}} effect of <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> is overcome. The first method is to shift {{the position of the}} brushes so that they are in the neutral plane when the generator is producing its normal load current. in the other method, special field poles, called interpoles, are installed in the generator to counteract the effect of <b>armature</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

40|$|Core loss {{is one of}} the {{significant}} factors affecting the high power density of permanent magnet machines; thus, it is necessary to consider core loss in machine design. This paper presents a novel method for calculating the core loss of permanent magnet synchronous machines under space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) excitation, taking magnetic saturation and cross coupling into account. In order to accurately obtain the direct and quadrature (d-q) axis, current in the given load condition, the permanent magnet motor model under SVPWM excitation has been modified, so as to consider the influence of magnetic saturation and cross coupling effects on the d-q axis flux-linkage. Based on the magnetic field distribution caused by permanent magnet and <b>armature</b> <b>reactions,</b> the stator core loss can be calculated with the core loss analytical model, corresponding to the rotational magnetic field. In this study, the method has been applied to analyze core loss in an interior permanent magnet synchronous machine, and has been validated by the experimental results. The influence of pole/slot number combinations on core loss in the same on-load condition is also investigated. This study provides a potential method to guide motor design optimization...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the main}} {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} fast analytical model to be used in optimization process or coupled with other fast analytical models. A reluctance network of DC series machine is developed and shows its accuracy and robustness thanks to the consideration of the <b>armature</b> magnetic <b>reaction</b> (AMR) which is an important phenomenon in high saturated DC motors. This model is validated by a statistical way and presents a fast computation time thanks to an equivalent symmetrical machine. The optimization is used with RN and FE models and shows the efficiency of the RN to find an optimum without needing the FE final step optimization...|$|R
50|$|Without <b>armature</b> <b>reaction,</b> the {{magnetic}} neutral axis (MNA) would coincide with geometrical neutral axis (GNA). <b>Armature</b> <b>reaction</b> causes the neutral plane to {{shift in the}} direction of rotation, and if the brushes are in the neutral plane at no load, that is, when no armature current is flowing, they will not be in the neutral plane when armature current is flowing. For this reason it is desirable to incorporate a corrective system into the generator design.|$|E
50|$|The diagram shows three {{arrangements}} of a metadyne machine. In all cases, compensation windings have been omitted for clarity. The first arrangement represents a one-cycle cross-field machine. In a normal DC machine, {{the effect of}} the excitation current generates a flux (A1), which in turn generates a quadrature flux which is at right angles to the exciting flux. By wiring the quadrature brushes together, current is produced in the armature, and the flux that this produces (A2) is again at right angles to the quadrature axis, resulting in an <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> which is directly opposed to the original excitation. This feature is fundamental to the machine, and does not depend on its direction of rotation. When the <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> is partially compensated by a compensation winding, the uncompensated portion of the <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> acts in this way. As the output current rises, it suppresses {{the effect of the}} excitation, until it reaches a state where there is just enough excitation to maintain the current. Any further increase would eliminate the flux which sustains its operation, and the current is maintained irrespective of the resistance of the load or the back emf produced by it. The machine thus acts as a constant-current generator, where the current is proportional to the excitation.|$|E
50|$|The brush-setting {{method is}} {{satisfactory}} in installations {{in which the}} generator operates under a fairly constant load. If the load varies to a marked degree, the neutral plane will shift proportionately, and the brushes {{will not be the}} correct position at all times. The brush-setting method is the most common means of correcting for <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> in small generators (those producing approximately 1000 W or less). Larger generators require the use of interpoles.|$|E
40|$|An {{exploration}} of streetscape lighting that responds to site phenomena provides a basis {{to explore the}} abilities of sensor driven devices to construct landscape form. The project expresses multiple reactive spaces through a hypothetical design project on Pine Street in New York City. The landscape is the input using the variables of wind, sound, motion, and light in order to focus, open, lower, and contract each lighting device. As the landscape progresses throughout the day, season, and/or year, various relationships are created in form and light to organize spaces on multiple scales. Data becomes the <b>armature</b> for scripted <b>reactions</b> allowing the infrastructure to respond for safety or efficiency. With the proliferation of sensor networks and sensor systems, the possibilities arise for the re-articulation of data expression. The single lighting device works within a network that is connected by the specifi c phenomenology of the site. The project is grounded historically in the landscape folly, an architectural device {{that is not what}} it appears to be (Figure 1). ...|$|R
40|$|Advances in ultra {{high speed}} linear {{induction}} electromagnetic launchers {{over the past}} decade have focused on magnetic compensation of the exit and entry-edge transient flux wave to produce efficient and compact linear electric machinery. The paper discusses two approaches to edge compensation in long-stator induction catapults with typical end speeds of 150 to 1, 500 m/s. In classical linear induction machines, the exit-edge effect is manifest as two auxiliary traveling waves that produce a magnetic drag on the projectile and a loss of magnetic flux over the main surface of the machine. In the new design for the Stator Compensated Induction Machine (SCIM) high velocity launcher, the exit-edge effect is nulled by a dual wavelength machine or alternately the airgap flux is peaked at a location prior to the exit edge. A four (4) stage LIM catapult is presently being constructed for 180 m/s end speed operation using double-sided longitudinal flux machines. Advanced exit and entry edge compensation is being used to maximize system efficiency, and minimize stray heating of the <b>reaction</b> <b>armature.</b> Each stage will output approximately 60 kN of force and produce over 500 G s of acceleration on the armature. The advantage of this design is there is no ablation to the projectile and no sliding contacts, allowing repeated firing of the launcher without maintenance of any sort. The paper shows results of a parametric study for 500 m/s and 1, 500 m/s linear induction launchers incorporating two of the latest compensation techniques for an air-core stator primary and an iron-core primary winding. Typical thrust densities for these machines are in the range of 150 kN/sq. m. to 225 kN/sq. m. and these compete favorably with permanent magnet linear synchronous machines. The operational advantages of the high speed SCIM launcher are shown by eliminating the need for pole-angle position sensors as would be required by synchronous systems. The stator power factor is also improved...|$|R
50|$|By {{varying the}} {{excitation}} of a synchronous motor, {{it can be}} made to operate at lagging, leading and unity power factor. Excitation at which the power factor is unity is termed normal excitation voltage. The magnitude of current at this excitation is minimum. Excitation voltage more than normal excitation is called over excitation voltage, excitation voltage less than normal excitation is called under excitation. When the motor is over excited, the back emf will be greater than the motor terminal voltage. This causes a demagnetizing effect due to <b>armature</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Since an {{armature}} {{is wound}} with coils of wire, {{a magnetic field}} is {{set up in the}} armature whenever a current flows in the coils. This field is at right angles to the generator field, and is called cross magnetization of the armature. The effect of the armature field is to distort the generator field and shift the neutral plane. The neutral plane is the position where the armature windings are moving parallel to the magnetic flux lines, that is why an axis lying in this plane is called as magnetic neutral axis (MNA). This effect is known as <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> and is proportional to the current flowing in the armature coils.|$|E
50|$|The winding {{specifications}} affect motor performance the most. Changing {{the number}} of turns per slot or the diameter of magnet wire produces results that differ greatly from each other. Environmental temperature affects the magnetic forces of magnets and the winding resistance, and so indicates changes in motor performance. Changing anisotropic magnets from wet to dry results in decreasing stall torques and increasing no-load speed due to the magnetic force being weakened. Magnets are held in a housing for their full capability, while using a thin-wall housing will result in magnetic force leaking through the housing wall. That is where magnet yokes are used to prevent magnetic leakage, thus maintaining the full capacity of the magnets. Phase refers to positional relations between the center line of each polar magnet and the switching position of commutator segments and brushes. Lagging in phase causes inefficiency, electrical noise, and shortened life. To avoid these situations, improved motors are assembled with forward brush-shifting that offsets the <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> during load operation to keep them on neutral electrically.|$|E
50|$|The Rosenberg {{generator}} is {{very similar}} to the Metadyne generator, both in its construction and its electrical connection. It generally does not have a compensation winding, so that the whole of the <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> opposes the initial excitation. Parts of the magnetic circuit are normally not laminated, which creates delays between excitations and fluxes, but the machines are used in applications where a quick response is not essential. Their predominant use has been in trains, where they are axle-driven, and used to provide lighting and the charging of batteries. An axle-driven generator is subject to variable speeds and changes in the direction of rotation, but the characteristics of the machine allow it to produce useful energy down to very low speeds. At slow speeds, the output voltage increases with the square of the speed, but the magnetic circuit soon becomes saturated, resulting in much smaller increases as the speed increases. When used in circuits which include batteries charged from the output, a rectifier or reverse-current cut-out is normally required to prevent discharge of the batteries through the generator at very low speeds, or when the train stops.|$|E
50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The magnetomotive force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the <b>armature</b> <b>reaction</b> of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.|$|E

The literature review part presents theories and applications of asymmetrical machine. Four categories regarding asymmetrical machine, namely mixed pole, saturation mitigation, pole shifting and asymmetrical pole shaping, are summarized.

40|$|A new linear {{synchronous}} motor (LSM) with permanent magnet (PM) is proposed to develop a linear motor for transportation with high efficiency. The LSM has very high air-gap flux density beyond the remanent magnetization of rare earth PM, which is generated by a special field structure with rare earth PM.
