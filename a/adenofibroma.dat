40|$|Cytogenetic {{analysis}} of two pulmonary chondroid hamartomas and nine breast <b>adenofibromas</b> revealed clonal chromosome aberrations in both hamartomas and in four breast tumors. To determine lineage {{of the cells}} with chromosome aberrations, a combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic approach was developed that enabled simultaneous ascertainment of cytogenetic aberrations and immunohistochemical features in individual cells. Immunohistochemical/cytogenetic evaluation of one hamartoma and two <b>adenofibromas</b> demonstrated that neoplastic proliferation, in each case, was confined to the mesenchymal (stromal) component, whereas epithelial cells appeared to be reactive. Cytogenetically abnormal short-term cultures of the remaining hamartoma and another of the breast <b>adenofibromas</b> were composed entirely of mesenchymal elements, indicating mesenchymal clonality in those tumors as well. Our findings support redesignation of pulmonary chondroid hamartomas as 'pulmonary chondromas' and suggest that carcinomas developing within fibroadenomas arise from reactive epithelial proliferation.

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} the {{sensitivity and specificity}} of subjective evaluation of gray-scale and Doppler ultrasound findings (here called pattern recognition) when used by experienced ultrasound examiners with regard to making a specific diagnosis of adnexal masses. Methods Within {{the framework of a}} European multi-center study, the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis study, comprising nine ultrasound centers, women with at least one adnexal mass were examined with gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonography by experienced ultrasound examiners. A standardized examination technique, and standardized terms and definitions were used. Using pattern recognition the examiners classified each mass as benign or malignant and suggested a specific diagnosis (e. g. dermoid cyst or endometrioma). The reference standard was the histology of the surgically removed adnexal tumors. Results A total of 1066 women were included, of whom 800 bad a benign mass and 266 a malignant mass. A specific diagnosis based on ultrasound findings was suggested in 899 (84 %) tumors. The specificity was high for all diagnoses (range, 94 - 100 %). The sensitivity was highest for benign teratoma/dermoid cysts (86 %, 100 / 116), hydrosalpinges (86 %, 18 / 21), peritoneal pseudocysts (80 %, 4 / 5) and endometriomas (77 %, 1531199), and lowest for functional cysts (17 %, 4124), paraovarian/parasalpingeal cysts (14 %, 3121), benign rare tumors (11 %, 119), <b>adenofibromas</b> (8 %, 3 / 39), simple cysts (6 %, 1 / 18) and struma ovarii (0 %, 0 / 5). The positive and negative likelihood ratios of pattern recognition with regard to dermoid cysts, hydrosalpinges and endometriomas were 68. 2 and 0. 14, 38. 9 and 0. 15, and 33. 3 and 0. 24, respectively. Dermoid cysts, hydrosalpinges, functional cysts, paraovarian cysts, peritoneal pseudocysts, fibromas/fibrothecomas and simple cysts were never misdiagnosed as malignancies by the ultrasound examiner, whereas more than 10 % of inflammatory processes, <b>adenofibromas</b> and rare benign tumors including struma ovarii were misdiagnosed as malignancies. Conclusions Using subjective evaluation of gray-scale and Doppler ultrasound findings it is possible to make an almost conclusive diagnosis of a dermoid cyst, endometrioma and hydrosalpinx.

40|$|When {{immersed}} in water cells of hepatomas produced by p-dimethyl-aminoazobenzene (butter yellow) take in less water than liver cells {{from which they}} are derived and more rapidly undergo disintegration; cholangiomas produced by butter yellow undergo similar changes. As {{a result of the}} injury of the tumor cells by water the osmotic exchange, characteristic of the normal liver cells under the same conditions, is impaired within the initial half hour of immersion. Solutions of sodium chloride isotonic for hepatoma tissue have a concentration approximating 0. 16 molar and for cholangioma, 0. 2 molar, whereas solutions isotonic for normal liver tissue approximate 0. 34 molar. Water exchange of hepatoma and of cholangioma tissue in solutions of sodium chloride of various concentrations deviates from a proportional relation to the concentration more than does normal liver tissue under the same conditions. Water exchange of sarcoma of the subcutaneous tissue produced by benzpyrene when {{immersed in}} water resembles that of interstitial fibrous tissue of normal animals, but by the procedures that have been used water exchange of the tumor cells alone has not been measurable. Microscopic examination indicates that the sarcoma cells are as susceptible to injury as those of the other tumors that have been examined.

30|$|Uterine <b>adenofibroma</b> {{is a rare}} benign {{neoplasm}} that is classified into the mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumor group. It typically affects the endometrium; involvement of the cervix is an unusual condition. We present a 55 -year-old woman with the complaint of perimenopausal genital bleeding. Her gynecologic examination revealed a firm, pedunculated 2 [*]×[*] 2  cm polypoid lesion on the cervix. A diagnostic polypectomy was performed and histopathological findings of the cervical biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis cervical <b>adenofibroma.</b> Although this lesion appears to be histological benign, multiple recurrences, local invasion, and involvement by adenocarcinoma have been reported. Therefore, total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy was performed.|$|E
30|$|<b>Adenofibroma</b> most {{commonly}} {{arises from the}} endometrium, but 10 % of the tumors originate in the cervix [7]. They usually present as broad-based polypoid masses that often have villous and spongy cut surfaces with cystic spaces surrounded by firm tissue [8].|$|E
30|$|It is {{clinically}} {{important to}} distinguish adenofibromas from adenosarcomas. Clement and Scully [7] have recommended {{the following criteria}} for the pathologic diagnosis of adenosarcoma rather than <b>adenofibroma</b> when {{one or more of}} the following signs are present: a stromal mitotic count of ≥ 2 per 10 high power fields (HPF), marked stromal cellularity, and more than mild degrees of stromal nuclear atypia. On the other hand, Zaloudek et al. [10] suggested that adenosarcomas should be diagnosed when mitosis is more than 4 cells in 10 HPF. The histological differential diagnosis of <b>adenofibroma</b> and adenosarcoma includes endometrial polyps, which are at the benign end of the histologic spectrum, and carcinosarcoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma, at the malignant end.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To analyze immunohistochemically morules in endometrioid lesions to {{show that}} CD 10 is a {{sensitive}} marker for morular metaplasia. Experimental Design: Immunohistochemical analysis of 53 instances of morular metaplasia comprising 1 cyclic endometrium and 52 endometrioid lesions associated with focal glandular complexity corresponding to 9 polyps, 4 atypical polypoid adenomyomas, 24 complex endometrial hyperplasias (18 with and 6 without atypia), 12 grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinomas in early clinical stages of both uterus and ovary, and three ovarian <b>adenofibromas.</b> Immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections was done for CD 10, beta-catenin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and cytokeratins 5 - 6, 7, 8, 13, 18, 19, 20, and 34 beta-E 12. Results: Morules were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and had beta-catenin positive nuclei. Cytokeratins 8, 18, 19 were positive; cytokeratins 7 and 20 were negative; and cytokeratins 5 - 6, 13, and 34 beta-E 12 were weakly positive. All cases revealed strongly positive membranous CD 10 staining in morules, which was absent in glands. CD 10 positivity allowed easy identification of morules at low power in various types of surgical specimens and in curettings. CD 10 also highlighted early morular metaplasia in glandular epithelium. In cases associated with squamous, keratinizing metaplasia, CD 10 discriminated between both types of metaplasia. Conclusions: CD 10 staining represents a useful marker of morules in endometrioid neoplasms of the female genital tract, permitting identification of lesions usually associated with an attenuated malignancy. Considering the immunohistochemical and genetic similarities of morules in tumors of different organs, {{it is likely that}} this marker may be also useful to diagnose morular metaplasia in similar neoplasms of extragenital locations...|$|R
40|$|The use of grey-scale {{ultrasound}} morphology {{to characterize}} a pelvic mass {{may also be}} called ‘pattern recognition’. The grey-scale ultrasound image provides us with the same information as that obtained by the surgeon or pathologist {{when he or she}} cuts a surgical specimen to see what it looks like inside. Many pelvic masses have such a typical macroscopic appearance that a fairly confident diagnosis can be {{made on the basis of}} their macroscopic appearance alone, i. e. on the basis of their grey-scale ultrasound image. This is true of most dermoid cysts, endometriomas, corpus luteum cysts, hydrosalpinges and peritoneal pseudocysts, and of many paraovarian cysts and benign solid ovarian tumours, for example, fibromas, fibrothecomas, thecofibromas, thecomas and Brenner tumours. A mass with irregularities should always evoke suspicion of malignancy. A mass that is completely smooth is almost certainly benign. Papillary projections—considered a strong sign of malignancy—are more common in borderline tumours than in invasive cancers but may also be seen in benign tumours, for example, in <b>adenofibromas.</b> They explain many false-positive ultrasound diagnoses of malignancy. Pattern recognition is superior to all other ultrasound methods (e. g. simple classification systems, scoring systems, mathematical models for calculating the risk of malignancy) for discrimination between benign and malignant extrauterine pelvic masses. Today's often too liberal use of transvaginal ultrasound gives clinicians problems. Many adnexal masses that probably would have remained undetected before the ultrasound era are now found incidentally at transvaginal ultrasound examination in women without symptoms of an adnexal tumour. The natural history of incidentally detected pelvic masses with benign ultrasound morphology is not known. Therefore, the optimal management of such tumours is also unknown...|$|R
40|$|The clinicopathologic {{features}} of 472 ovarian epithelial clear cell neoplasms (4 <b>adenofibromas</b> [AFs], 41 atypical proliferative [borderline] tumors [APTs], and 427 carcinomas [CAs]) were studied {{in order to}} elucidate the morphologic steps involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors and determine whether clear cell CA is a type I or type II tumor in the dualistic model of ovarian carcinogenesis. Thirty-three percent of the CAs had an adenofibromatous background [CA(AF+) ], and 67 % did not [CA(AF-) ]. Endometriosis was found in all types of tumors, but tumors arising in endometriotic cysts were more frequent with CA(AF-) s (p I) and were higher grade compared to CA(AF+) s or CA(AF-) with endometriosis (p-values, < 0. 0001 to 0. 0071). All AFs and APTs were stage I compared to 79 % of CA(AF+) s. An increase in mean tumor size correlated with each respective tumor category from AF (6. 8 cm) to CA(AF+) [12. 9 cm]. Notable nuclear atypia was absent in all AFs but was focally present in 27 % of APTs and in the adenofibromatous background of 24 % of the CA(AF+) s. An increase {{in the proportion of}} carcinoma in the CA(AF+) s correlated with an increase in grade and advanced stage. In summary, ovarian clear cell CA appears to develop along two pathways, both of which are related to endometriosis. We speculate that, in one, epithelial atypia arises in an endometriotic cyst and then evolves into clear cell CA, and, in the other, non-cystic endometriosis induces a fibromatous reaction resulting in the formation of AF, which then develops into APT and subsequently a clear cell CA. The absence of endometriosis or adenofibromatous components in CC(AF-) s may be due to overgrowth and obliteration by the invasive carcinoma. Finally, the findings in this study support the view that both types of clear cell CA [CC(AF+) and CC(AF-) ] are more closely related to type I tumors...|$|R

Although mitotic figures were inconspicuous, Ki 67 was brisk and p 53 demonstrated 25 – 50 % positivity. Sections also showed a von Meyenberg complex located adjacent to the tumor.
