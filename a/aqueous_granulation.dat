40|$|Prime {{object of}} {{present study was}} to develop and {{evaluate}} mucoadhesive tablets of Salbutamol Sulphate by non <b>aqueous</b> <b>granulation</b> of polymers HPMC K- 4 M (Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose) and Chitosan in different ratios (1 : 1. 1 : 2 & 2 : 1). The tablets were evaluated for weight variation, hardness, thickness, drug content uniformity, mucoadhesion and swelling index. Swelling index of batches containing more HPMC K- 4 M was greater than that of containing less HPMC K- 4 M. In vitro bioadhesive strength studies showed that tablets containing more HPMC K- 4 M were excellent in bioadhesive nature. The in-vitro drug release was studied in phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8). And all batches were subjected to release kinetics model fitting...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{dispersion}}, {{defined as}} the dispersion {{of one or more}} active ingredient in a carrier or matrix at solid state, is an efficient strategy for improving dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs for enhancement of their bioavailability. Non aqueous granulations technique means size enlarged granules containing MCC with CCS showed higher solubility and dissolution rate compared to other conventional formulations such as tablets or capsules, solid dispersion which can be prepared by various methods has many advantages. Fairly soluble drugs in gastrointestinal (GI) media exhibit complete oral absorption, and thus good bioavailability. About 40 % of drugs are not soluble in water in practice and therefore are slowly absorbed, which results in insufficient and uneven bioavailability and GI toxicity. For BCS class II drug, solubility is a crucial rate limiting factor to achieve its desired level in systemic circulation for pharmacological response. Thus, problematic solubility of BCS class II drug is a main challenge for dosage. This review give detail information to improve the BCS class II drug solubility by solid dispersion method and non <b>aqueous</b> <b>granulation</b> methods are ease and efficiency is most promising and routinely employed technique to resolve the solubility problems of BCS class II drug...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} binders to improve the flowability of granulates and compactibility of Metformin HCL (Met) using the moist <b>aqueous</b> <b>granulation</b> (MAG) process. The effect of the binder moisture content on granulate and tablet quality was also evaluated. Vinylpyrrolidone–vinyl acetate copolymer (Kollidon VA 64 fine: VA 64), polyvidone (Povidone K 12 : PVP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC SSL SF: HPC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Methocel E 5 LV: HPMC) were evaluated as binders. These granulates, except for HPMC, had a lower yield pressure than Met active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). HPMC Met was not sufficiently granulated with low water volume. No problems were observed with the VA 64 Met granulates during the tableting process. However, HPC Met granulates had a bowl-forming tendency, and PVP Met granulates had the tendency to stick during the tableting process. These bowl-forming and sticking tendencies may have been due to the low moisture absorbency of HPC and the high volume of bound water of PVP, respectively. VA 64 Met granulates had the highest ambient moisture content (bulk water, bound water) and moisture absorbency. It was concluded that the type of binder used for the Met MAG process has an impact on granulate flow and compactibility, as well as moisture absorbency and maintenance of moisture balance...|$|E
40|$|Aim of work: The aim {{of present}} study was to convert Metoprolol Succinate (MS) into Gastro Retentive Floating Tablet (GRFT) and {{simultaneously}} to determine the effect of Sodium alginate (SA) in combination with HPMC K 100 M in extending the release of MS. Method: The drug- excipients compatibility studies of MS and the polymers were carried by FTIR studies. The effervescent GRFT of MS was prepared by non <b>aqueous</b> wet <b>granulation.</b> All Formulations were evaluated for pre-compression, post-compression, in vitro buoyancy and accelerated stability studies: for the best formulation for 3 months. Results: The drug- excipients compatibility studies reveals that MS and the polymers used are compatible. Evaluation parameters were within the acceptable limits for all formulations. in vitro dissolution studies, showed the formulation F 4 having the combination of 20 % HPMC K 100 M and 10 % SA is exhibiting better extended release up to 12 h, with a Floating Lag Time (FLT) of 20 s, Total Floating Time (TFT) and Matrix Integrity (MI) maintained up to 12 h than other formulations.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the gum exudates of Terminalia catappa Linn. (TC gum) as a release retarding excipient in oral controlled drug delivery system. The rheological properties of TC gum were studied and different formulation techniques were {{used to evaluate the}} comparative drug release characteristics. The viscosity was found to be dependent on concentration and pH. Temperature up to 60 °C did not show significant effect on viscosity. The rheological kinetics evaluated by power law, revealed the shear thinning behavior of the TC gum dispersion in water. Matrix tablets of TC gum were prepared with the model drug dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DH) by direct compression, wet granulation and solid dispersion techniques. The dissolution profiles of the matrix tablets were compared with the pure drug containing capsules using the USP Basket apparatus with 500  ml phosphate buffer of pH  6. 8 as a dissolution medium. The drug release from the compressed tablets containing TC gum was comparatively sustained than pure drug containing capsules. Even though all the formulation techniques showed reduction of dissolution rate, <b>aqueous</b> wet <b>granulation</b> showed the maximum sustained release of more than 8  h. The release kinetics estimated by the power law revealed that the drug release mechanism involved in the dextromethorphan matrix is anomalous transport as indicated by the release exponent n values. Thus the study confirmed that the TC gum might be used in the controlled drug delivery system as a release-retarding polymer...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphism {{presents}} {{complex issues}} for the pharmaceutical industry from processing, regulatory, patenting and stability perspectives. It can be further challenging to control the same form throughout processing and development when it {{has the capacity to}} form a hydrate. Incorporation of water into the crystal lattice contributes to significant differences in solubility, stability and bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). During processing and formulating steps, water is used in many procedures such as, recrystallisation, wet <b>granulation,</b> <b>aqueous</b> coating lyophilisation etc. This can trigger anhydrous to hydrate conversion and could be detrimental for bioavailability and stability of the product. The factors responsible for this type of transition such as, role of solvent, activity of solvent, thermodynamic stability of different forms, equilibrium conditions, processing induced transformations are investigated. Theophylline, a channel hydrate, is chosen as a model compound which exhibits both polymorphs and solvates. The value of water activity at which the theophylline monohydrate is thermodynamically stable form was investigated using solubility, cooling crystallisation and slurry experiments and found to be aw 2 : 0. 70 at 25 QC. Full characterisation of the solid state chemistry of theophylline has resulted in the discovery of a new, previously unreported, anhydrous form of theophylline, called Form IV. Using solubility, crystallisation, slurrying and thermal experiments, Form IV was found to be thermodynamically more stable than the currently known stable form, Form H. The crystal structure of Form IV and Form I was determined by single crystal :X-Ray diffraction technique. The crystal structures for Form IV and Form I are deposited in Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) with reference code BAPLOT 03 and BAPLOT 04 respectively. The experimentally observed stability behaviour was correlated with the structural features of solid forms and also with the energy calculations. The kinetic ally stable Form H serves as the intermediate for polymorphic and hydrate-anhydrate transformations as the catemer motif observed in Form II can easily propagate by forming a strong and directional hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the dimer of theophylline molecules as observed in Form IV needs the presence of solvent to link through other dimers only by weak interactions. This results in the generation of Form IV only via solvent mediated transformations. Solid state chemistry of hydrate forming compounds Theophylline has also been used here as a model compound to study eo crystallisation with various saturated, dicarboxylic acids. A new, eo crystal of theophylline with adipic acid was generated and using thermal methods and PXRD, the stoichiometry (1 : 2, adipic acid: theophylline) is confirmed. The complex hydration-dehydration behaviour of theophylline was investigated. The samples subjected to different pharmaceutical processing conditions for hydration-dehydration, generated various. intermediate phases suggesting multiple dehydration mechanisms and the potential of phase transformations during processing of such kind of hydrate forming compounds. The sensitivity of thermal methods over other bulk methods such as PXRD, in detecting a small amount of phase impurity, has been highlighted.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{sustained}} release gastroretentive minimatrices of amoxicillin {{have been designed}} and optimized using central composite design. Effect of amount of xanthan gum, rate controlling polymers (HPMC K 100 M CR/PEO coagulant (1 : 1)), carbopol 974 P, and gas generating couple (sodium bicarbonate/citric acid (3 : 1)) was studied on dependent (response) variables, i. e., buoyancy lag time, drug release at 1  h, time required for 95 % drug release, swelling index, and bioadhesive strength. Minimatrices were prepared by non <b>aqueous</b> <b>granulation</b> method using solution of PVP K 30 in isopropyl alcohol. All the formulations were found to contain 99. 2 % to 100. 9 % of amoxicillin per minimatrix. Optimum formulation (Formulation number AGT 09) containing high level {{of the independent variables}} was having buoyancy lag time of 7  min and drug release at 1  h was 32. 5 %. It required 9. 39  h for 95 % drug release while swelling index and bioadhesive strength were 341 and 17. 9  dyn/cm 2, respectively. This formulation was said to be optimum because it has minimum buoyancy lag time, requires maximum time for 95 % drug release, and has higher bioadhesive capabilities. In vitro results of an optimized formulation indicate its sustained drug release and gastric retention capability, which may be very useful for effective treatment of H. pylori infection...|$|E
