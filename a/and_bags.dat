Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E

25|$|Jute is a bast fibre, {{which comes}} from the inner bark of the plants of the Corchorus genus. It is retted like flax, sundried and baled.

Jute can be blended with other fibres to make composite fabrics and work continues in Bangladesh to refine the processes and extend the range of usage possible. In the 1970s, jute-cotton composite fabrics were known as jutton fabrics.|$|E

25|$|Some {{years later}} the {{porcelain}} industry started to develop, favoured {{by the presence of}} kaolinite which was discovered near Limoges in 1768 (near St Yrieix, south-west of Limoges). Many of the inhabitants became employed in the new sector or in connected activities (including the lumbering of wood needed for firing the porcelain) in manufacture and exporting needed for European distribution of Limoges Boxes, dinnerware, and other porcelain wares. Because the Limousin region has had a long history of breeding (Baronet sheep and Limousine cows), the leather industry also settled in and around Limoges {{along the banks of the}} Vienne–the river providing the necessary water and power. Factories in Limoges and St Junien still produce luxury leather shoes, gloves, <b>and</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|E
25|$|The coarse outer fibers {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used by nomads to make ropes and tents. In earlier times, the coarse hair was mixed with down hair {{to make the}} weaving denser. However, the current increasing demand for the down fiber from the international market means that the fine fiber is mostly sold. The rarity of the white hair implicates that ropes made out of white and black Yarn is admired for its appearance and uniqueness. In west Sichuan, China, 34% of the animal fiber comes from yak hair alone. In Bhutan, the long hair is used for weaving tents, bags, rugs and slings, whereas in Mongolia it is used for clothing tents <b>and</b> <b>bags.</b> To obtain the optimal length, nomads comb the hair and then spin it into yarn. During this process, the loom determines {{the width of the}} tent squares and the length of the tent. The tent squares are then sewn tightly together by men.|$|E

Photos were released from Prince giving the impression that Hantuchová, from the start of the 2011 season, will be using the Prince EXO3 Tour 100. However, she signed a deal with Volkl Tennis and then used the Volkl Power Bridge 9. Starting with the 2011 Fed Cup, she began using the Prince EXO3 Tour Team 100 again, with which she won her fourth career title. In spring of 2015, Hantuchová started using HEAD rackets <b>and</b> <b>bags</b> although the racket is not part of the current range and appears to be all black in color. During the 2015 Grass Court Season to now, Hantuchová started using the HEAD Graphene Instinct MP racket. In 2016, Hantuchová switched her racquet brand back to Babolat.|$|E

Examples of individual tree pruning methods are Minimum Error Pruning (MEP), Error-based Pruning (EBP), Reduced-Error Pruning(REP), Critical Value Pruning (CVP) and Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP). In this paper, we report the results of applying Boosting <b>and</b> <b>Bagging</b> with these ve pruning methods to eleven datasets...|$|R
