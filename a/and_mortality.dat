5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, ingestion of ferric chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis.

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings {{in an attempt to}} estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{migration}} is the regular seasonal movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation <b>and</b> <b>mortality,</b> including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Bookends is {{a concept}} album that explores a life journey from {{childhood}} to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon, who joined the recording when Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.|$|E
5|$|In studies {{conducted}} in Ontario and Quebec, the mortality rate for dominant juveniles was 52%, <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> was 85% for juveniles who left the parents' territory between fledging in June to approximately mid-October. From fall to the following breeding season in March, further juvenile mortality was 50%. Territory-holding adult grey jays experienced low mortality rates (15.1 and 18.2% for males and females, respectively). The oldest known grey jay recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.|$|E
5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E

5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{composing}} {{new songs}} in 2011, {{and had the}} album's first recording sessions in early 2012 before the musicians {{decided to take a}} break. As all the band members got into side projects afterwards, work on Lightning Bolt only resumed in March 2013. The music for Lightning Bolt has a harder rock sound with longer songs to contrast predecessor Backspacer (2009), and the lyrics convey singer Eddie Vedder's feelings on aging <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} So Beautiful or So What {{features}} West African blues-inspired guitar playing, Indian-style percussion, and experimentation with samples, which ranged from {{an excerpt from}} a 1941 sermon to nighttime ambience in Kenya.

Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality <b>and</b> <b>mortality,</b> which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album.|$|E

5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E
