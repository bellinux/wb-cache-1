5|$|Another <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> is California, where {{recovery}} {{began to}} fluctuate or {{decline in the}} late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Australian Submarine Corporation {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the delivery of the Rockwell combat system, but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver the combat system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the combat system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the combat system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays {{in the provision of}} the software, the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the combat system had become the major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. The combat system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the combat system software—was continually postponed.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the Mexican court’s {{ability to}} reconsider the facts at any stage of the {{proceeding}} is a major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> and highlights the effect the lack of implementing legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system has had on the Convention’s effectiveness.

25|$|An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> is {{the effect}} that industrial-scale {{manufacturing}} and use of nanomaterials would have on {{human health and the}} environment, as suggested by nanotoxicology research. For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments. Others counter that overregulation would stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations. Public health research agencies, such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are actively conducting research on potential health effects stemming from exposures to nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} sexual abuse among female {{domestic}} workers is another <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> particularly given that domestic servants {{are not covered by}} the UAE labour law of 1980 or the draft labour law of 2007. Worker protests have been suppressed and protesters imprisoned without due process. In its 2013 Annual Report, Amnesty International drew attention to the United Arab Emirates' poor record on a number of human rights issues. They highlighted the government's restrictive approach to freedom of speech and assembly, their use of arbitrary arrest and torture, and UAE's use of the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} conditions of Saginaw, {{compounded by the}} 2007–2012 global financial crisis, make up another significant <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> for the city's residents. The decline of manufacturing jobs has resulted in higher than average rates of unemployment. There has been a decline in property values in the city, which has decreased {{the amount of money}} the city government is able to collect through property taxes. Unemployment in Saginaw peaked in July 2009, according to the Bureau of labor statistics, standing at 23.5%. Since then, the unemployment rate has dropped to 9.0% as of April 2015. 2015 has seen a decrease in crime activity in Saginaw as the unemployment has decreased.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{presence in}} Saginaw {{declined in the}} latter half of the 20th century, leading to high unemployment throughout the city. As a result, the city's population diminished; from 2000 to 2010, the population of Saginaw proper decreased by nearly ten thousand people, and Michigan's state population during that time period decreased by 0.6% percent, the only U.S. state to lose population during the decade of the 2000s. In addition, Saginaw has faced increasing social problems relating to poverty as a result of its high rate of unemployment. In recent years, Saginaw's crime rate has been a major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> for the community.|$|E
25|$|Although {{groundwater}} {{sources are}} quite prevalent, one major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> is the renewal rate or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. Abstracting from groundwater sources that are non-renewable {{could lead to}} exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed. Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems. Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.|$|E
