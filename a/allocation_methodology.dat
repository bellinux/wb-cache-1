50|$|CASM is {{generally}} calculated {{for a particular}} airline (or portion of an airline—for instance, an airline's Pacific operations {{as opposed to the}} entire airline) for a particular period of time—a year, a quarter, a month and so forth. It can also be calculated for a particular route of an airline. However, when it is calculated for anything other than the entire operation of an airline, the relevant costs will inevitably involve cost allocations that require judgments. For instance, the salary of the airline's senior management needs to be spread across the different parts of the airline and can be divvied up across its routes according to many different methodologies—by the number of flights on that route during that time period, by the number of flight hours on that route, etc. There is not necessarily any right method for making such cost allocations, but it is important when making comparisons across airlines that if an <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology</b> is relevant (i.e. less than the entire of each airline is being compared) then the same <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology</b> is used with each airline being compared.|$|E
50|$|An {{effective}} cost <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology</b> enables {{an organization}} {{to identify what}} services are being provided and what they cost, to allocate costs to business units, and to manage cost recovery. Under this model, both the service provider and its respective consumers become aware of their service requirements and usage and how they directly influence the costs incurred. This information, in turn, improves discipline within the business units and financial discipline across the entire organization. With the organization articulating the costs of services provided, the business units become empowered - and encouraged - {{to make informed decisions}} about the services and availability levels they request. They can make trade-offs between service levels and costs, and they can benchmark internal costs against outsourced providers.|$|E

One {{of the most important}} aspects in the design of MRS is the allocation of tasks among the robots in a productive and efficient manner.

5000|$|Thus, {{whenever}} a new local service provider entered a given market, {{it would be}} allocated 10,000 numbers by default, even if the provider obtained only a few customers. As more companies requested numbering allocations, many area codes were faced {{with the problem of}} exhausting their number supply; in telecom jargon, such an area is [...] "in jeopardy." [...] Many of the new telecom ventures were not successful. While the number of area codes increased rapidly, this did not always translate to a much larger number of telephone subscribers as large blocks of numbers remained unassigned because of the 10,000-number block <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology.</b> When these telecom ventures were merged or terminated, their blocks transferred to the successors or remained unused.

50|$|The core {{components}} of a cost allocation system consist {{of a way to}} track which organizations provides a product and/or service, the organizations that consume the products and/or services, and a list of portfolio offerings (e.g. service catalog). Depending on the operating structure within a company, the cost allocation data may generate an internal invoice or feed an ERP system's chargeback module. Accessing the data via an invoice or chargeback module are the typical methods that drive personnel behavior. In return, the consumption data becomes a great source of quantitative information to make better business decisions. Today’s organizations face growing pressure to control costs and enable responsible financial management of resources. In this environment, an organization is expected to provide services cost-effectively and deliver business value while operating under tight budgetary constraints. One way to contain costs is to implement a cost <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology,</b> where your business units become directly accountable for the services they consume.|$|E

40|$|Resource {{allocations}} {{are among}} the most important decisions for any organization. Nonprofit organizations are no different than their for-profit counterparts—effective resource allocation {{is the best way to}} achieve strategic objectives. While the for-profit goal is primarily shareholder wealth, nonprofit goals are more complex—the links between resource allocation and productivity are not always clear. ^ In the 1970 s, many higher education institutions faced austere times and were forced to consider organizational structure changes that improved their chances for long-term survival. Several moved from a centralized allocation system to a decentralized system—deciding that local leaders had better information on which to base decisions and could move faster to make academic program adjustments in a changing educational marketplace. ^ One of the notable decentralized models is Responsibility Center Management (RCM). Because all of the revenues are allocated to the unit that earns it, the RCM model requires a methodology to charge revenue-generating units for their share of central administrative activities. ^ There is no evidence that any one of the <b>allocation</b> <b>methodologies</b> reviewed in this study is completely effective in allocating central costs. Most of the methodologies are based on averaging, and, since the average does not represent any individual unit, the methodologies can become dysfunctional over time. A review of financial data finds that fast-growth academic units in this study benefited most from the various <b>allocation</b> <b>methodologies</b> in place. ^ While some administrators interviewed thought the system fairly allocated costs, the majority felt that it was less than perfect in aligning benefits with allocations. Many pointed to the lack of defined service levels for activities funded through the allocation system, which is an important element in perceived fairness. Even though there were issues in how the allocation systems worked, it was clear that there was strong support of the decentralized model. ^ When developing or revising cost <b>allocation</b> <b>methodologies,</b> institutions should focus on five areas: (a) determine the cost drivers of administrative activities, (b) create allocation pools based on cost drivers, (c) distribute costs on a consistent basis, (d) move from average to marginal cost rules, and (e) create reasonable transition periods for change. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Deregulation is {{the major}} trend in the {{electric}} power industry throughout the world. The main focus in deregulated system operation is to optimize the system welfare by introducing competition, mainly, among generators. The grid operator is required {{to know how the}} power offered by the generators is reaching the load; for which the power flow is to be traced along the lines. Tracing of electricity plays very important role in the open market, as it increases the clarity in open market and promote efficient system. In this paper, tracing based loss <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology</b> is developed to allocate the transmission losses to generators alone. This method works based on the principle of power flow tracing which in turn uses proportional sharing principle. The effectiveness of the proposed loss <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology</b> is tested on standard IEEE- 5 bus, IEEE- 30 bus and real time Indian- 24 bus systems and the loss allocation results are also compared with the existing Bialek method.

40|$|There {{is now an}} {{international}} consensus {{on the need to}} strengthen the systemic focus of prudential regulation and supervision – ie to adopt the “macroprudential ” approach. A key element of this approach is the ability to allocate systemic risk to individual institutions, so as to calibrate prudential tools accordingly. Making use of constructs from game theory, this paper proposes an <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology</b> that has a number of appealing features. First, it produces institution-specific measures of systemic importance that add up exactly to systemic risk. Second, it is general enough to be applicable to all popular risk measures, which treat the financial system as a portfolio of institutions. Third, it accommodates model uncertainty. The paper also analyses different applications of the methodology and argues that they should be applied in different contexts. Then it examines different drivers of systemic importance and their interactions and illustrates how the <b>allocation</b> <b>methodology</b> {{can be used as a}} basis of policy interventions with macroprudential objectives...|$|E
