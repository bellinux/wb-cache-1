40|$|Master of EducationThe {{provision}} of educational services {{is a major}} task of Australian state political systems. At various times, in efforts to moderate the bureaucratic tendencies of centralised administrations by bringing {{a wider range of}} opinion to bear on the administration of public education, bodies to advise the responsible minister, and Parliament in some cases, have been established. An examination of the work of the Council of Public Education in Victoria, established ostensibly for this purpose, reveals that there is a confusion over the role and influence of advise within a state political <b>administrative</b> structure. This <b>inquiry</b> postulates that there are two basic, but disparate, functions of advice: a political function where representatives of interest groups can put their views to the Minister, and an evaluative function where the policies and practices of the public sector are evaluated. The formation of the Council of Public Education was justified to the public in terms of the latter function, but other features of the Council, such as its representative membership, are more like those of a body with political functions. This disjunction between structure and function, together with a confusion over the extent and use of its powers, have rendered the Council ant: ineffectual evaluative advisory body. The attitudes of administrators and other interested parties towards. educational advisory bodies are illuminated' by an investigation of the origins of these bodies in Victoria and New South Wales. The comparison of developments in the two states indicates that the concept of an evaluative advisory body, operating free of administrative and political interference, is incompatible with the present system of centralised control of public education in these states.

40|$|ABSTRACTImperial Ark? The Politics of Wildlife in East and South-Central Africa, 1920 - 1992 byJeffrey SchauerDoctor of Philosophy in HistoryUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor James Vernon, ChairThe {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} "politics of wildlife" in British colonies in East and South-Central Africa {{during the colonial}} era and after independence. By conceptualizing that "politics" around the institutions, individuals, and interests that {{took an interest in}} wildlife matters, the dissertation attends to the emergence of and changes in wildlife policy as they were shaped by the characteristics of colonial rule and a broader set of regional, imperial, and global developments, including decolonization and post-Second World War internationalism. It also attends to the influence of Africans on shaping colonial wildlife policy, whether as farmers, nationalists, or local officials. The central discovery of this dissertation is that wildlife policy moved from being the preserve of an imperial lobby to a policy sphere governed by the concerns of various sectors of local colonial society. After the Second World War, security concerns combined with a strengthened international preservationist movement to effectively internationalise Africa's wildlife. This occurred alongside Africanization, a policy pursued by newly-independent governments in order to shore up their own control over policymaking, and the arrival of international scientists, who sought to introduce their own priorities to the wildlife sector. In this seven-decade contest between those interests which were local, colonial, or national on the one hand, and those which were imperial, international, or global on the other, a surprising array of interests sought to capture East and South-Central Africa's wildlife sector for ambitions related to economic development, anti-colonial campaigning, preservationist advocacy, scientific <b>inquiry,</b> <b>administrative</b> supremacy, and colonial and national security. Over time, struggles for the control of this sector reflected broader trends at the global and local levels, marking the ascendancy and eclipse of colonial empires, and the rise of a neo-colonial order...|$|R
