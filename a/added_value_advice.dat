The AG started its work {{in the context of the}} economic crisis of 2008 - 2009 and was keen to identify contributions of environmental research that could help to resolve the crisis. At the same time, it was also motivated by longer-term issues of societal transformation. In the second period of its work (2010) the longer-term issues, especially the innovation agenda of the European Union, took centre stage. The questions addressed by the Advisory Group included the following : How can we improve the relevance of research for innovation and other objectives of Europe 2020 ? What are the priority research areas ? Between December 2009 and October 2010, the Advisory Group met six times. Meetings included presentations by distinguished experts and officials, as well as brainstorming sessions on the following topics : climate services and Ecosystems services, participation of New Member States and regional considerations within the Environment theme, the environment and cultural heritage, interconnections between science and policy. A significant proportion of the AG's time was devoted to discussing the content of this report. Written submissions from individual AG members were requested and have been incorporated in the text.

Added value is defined here as the difference in economic value between the physical inputs and outputs of a production process, and is generally analysed at the firm or national economy level. In this study we identify and discuss issues involved in quantifying <b>added</b> <b>value</b> at the industrial process level, and develop a bottom-up method to estimate the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> by forest industry processes. We calculate the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> by 14 traditional and emerging processes within the Swedish forest products industries, and express the results using various indices.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{strategic}} importance of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> as a means for achieving competitive advantage, but little attention has been paid to the meaning of the term “added value”. Numerous messages about <b>added</b> <b>values</b> of food products are communicated by and to different actors, values such as convenience regarding fast-food, luxury regarding meals, products without chemical additives, health, quality, taste, what the package looks like, exclusiveness, tradition/story-telling/, and many others. Food producers, wholesalers, retailers, and end-consumers constitute some of these actors. However, the concept of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> and the relationships between the different aspects are unclear and illusive. There is a need to explore as well as clarify definitions and dimensions. Therefore, the aim of this article is to develop a conceptual framework which explores definitions and discussions associated with <b>added</b> <b>values</b> of food products. Traditionally, the literature has made strict and categorical distinctions between core <b>values</b> and <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> However, we stress that this traditional view needs to be challenged. For food products we argue that core values cannot be clearly distinguished from <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> We argue that not only the end consumer but all actors involved in the supply chain contribute to the overall realization of the <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> i. e. all actors must perceive, appreciate, value and realize the <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> Only then may the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> result in willingness to purchase the products, increased market share or strengthened position at different markets...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the organic market in the EU has grown faster than the organic {{agricultural}} area, {{which raises the question}} to what extent organic supply chains function effectively. Therefore, this study investigated the creation and distribution of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> in a number of organic supply chains in different EU countries. The results of the case studies suggest that higher <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is created in organic compared to conventional supply chains. However, no evidence was found that the relative share of organic farmers in the total <b>added</b> <b>value</b> differs substantially from that of conventional farmers. Also in organic food supply chains farmers capture a relative small proportion of <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> This can partly be explained by similarities of organic with conventional supply chains. It appears that the distribution of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> strongly depends on the structure and characteristics of the specific supply chain, such as level of chain integration and power relations between market players. No common patterns were identified regarding the impact of different types of retails and markets on the creation and distribution of <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> Investments in quality aspects, increased consumer interest in organic food, differentiation of products as well as efficiency in supply chain management are all relevant factors that contribute to higher <b>added</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R

40|$|Making {{profit is}} the {{foundation}} every modern company rests on. No profit, no business. During the passed 10 - 15 years making profits in the computer retailing industry has been harder and harder. Margins has has lessened and due to the simplification of computers and increased easiness to understand computers even more unqualified people may compete in the business. As an effort to increase the profitability of the industry niching was discussed as possible for success and earning money on <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> which is the theme running all through this thesis. The theories this thesis rests on are basically theories about a high quality service, which is the main foundation for any success: no high quality offered, no success. The high competition in this industry {{is one of the}} corner stones of the thesis as well due to the heavy competition in the investigated industry. A third important and clear corner stone are the theories about rules of public procurement which Government owned, or partially owned companies, has to follow. The fact that <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is a subgroup of customer value is natural, but in difference to <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> the concept of customer value is clearly defined, while the meaning of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is rather ambiguous and undefined. The theories about <b>added</b> <b>value</b> stretches from, spoken from Telia as telephone answering services to co-production of values, some theories even say that <b>added</b> <b>value</b> can only be defined by customers and not by the industry offering it. In this thesis, 25 industrial companies was to be interviewed, of which 14 accepted or had their key responsible in question available. This gives a response frequency of nearly 60 %. Five out of the 14 answering companies have to follow the rules of public procurement. The interviews have been carried out by Perspektiv Undersökningar by phone during the fortnight before mid summer 2004. Eight questions regarding <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> its importance and what <b>added</b> <b>values</b> to pay for have been asked. Very clear in this study was partially the importance of <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> and rather surprising after heaving read the theories, how unanimous the respondents were, who all of them mentioned <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to be the relation between customer and retailer and the importance of suppliers ability to understand and see what the customer need. It is very clear that the ability to make money on <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is limited as the customer regards the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of relation as obvious for any business transaction at all. However, the customer is prepared to pay a higher price to the supplier offering <b>added</b> <b>value,</b> than to suppliers just caring for transactions. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

In this study, {{the aim was to}} develop a method based on <b>added</b> <b>values</b> and risks for comparison and evaluation of stormwater systems. How <b>added</b> <b>values</b> are classified differs from case to case. The approach and the purpose of the analysis also affects the evaluation of <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> In this report <b>added</b> <b>values</b> are defined as:A value, for an individual, an organisation or the environment, other than the object's main intended purpose. In this report five different categories of risks and <b>added</b> <b>values</b> were studied, namely: environment, economy, technology, health and socioculture. In the analysis of <b>added</b> <b>values</b> the data collection was made in a questionnaire. A group was appointed the task to compile the answers and evaluate the outcome and identify the <b>added</b> <b>values</b> generated by the stormwater system. The risk assessment was conducted by estimating probabilities and consequences of a range of identified risk sources. The results were presented in a matrix. The methodology was tested in a case study where two stormwater systems were evaluated and compared to each other. One of the systems was a swale system and the other was a piped storm drainage system. The result showed no major differences with respect to <b>added</b> <b>values,</b> on the contrary, the risk assessment indicated some significant differences. The case study confirms that the developed and evaluated tool is applicable for this type of evaluation and comparison between different stormwater systems in diverse surroundings. The method, developed in this study can with advantage be used as a complementing tool when evaluating different stormwater system options. Validerat; 20150609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
