40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the rotavirus spike haemagglutinin viral protein 4 (VP 4) has been determined to a resolution of 26 A by cryo-electron microscopy and difference analysis of intact virions and smooth (spikeless) particles. Native and spikeless virions were mixed prior to cryo-preservation so that both structures could be determined from the same micrograph, thereby minimizing systematic errors. This mixing strategy was crucial for difference map analysis since VP 4 only accounts for approximately 1 % of the virion mass. The VP 4 spike is multi-domained and has a radial length of approximately 200 A with approximately 110 A projecting {{from the surface of}} the virus. Interactions between VP 4 and cell surface receptors are facilitated by the bi-lobed head, which allows multi-site interactions, as well as the uniform distribution of the VP 4 heads at maximum radius. The bi-lobed head is attached to a square-shaped body formed by two rods that have a slight left-handed helical twist. These rods merge with an angled, rod-like domain connected to a globular base approximately 85 A in diameter. The <b>anchoring</b> <b>base</b> displays pseudo 6 -fold symmetry. This surprising finding may represent a novel folding motif in which a single polypeptide of VP 4 contributes similar but non-equivalent domains to form the arms of the hexameric base. The VP 4 spike penetrates the virion surface approximately 90 A and interacts with both outer (VP 7) and inner (VP 6) capsid proteins. The extensive VP 4 -VP 7 and VP 4 -VP 6 interactions imply a scaffolding function in which VP 4 may participate in maintaining precise geometric register between the inner and outer capsids.

40|$|Abstract Background The Dermatology Quality Life Index (DLQI) {{has seen}} {{widespread}} {{use as a}} health-related quality of life measure {{for a variety of}} dermatological diseases. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the minimal important difference (MID) on the DLQI for patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Methods Data from 2 Phase III clinical trials of patients (N = 476 for Study A; N = 468 for Study B) with CIU were analyzed separately to estimate the MID for the DLQI for these populations. Both distributional <b>based</b> and <b>anchor</b> <b>based</b> approaches were used for deriving estimates. The <b>anchor</b> <b>based</b> approach relied upon patient self assessments of pruritus severity; the distributional based approaches relied upon estimating the standard error of measurement, as well as one-half the standard deviation of the DLQI from each study. Results The distributional approaches resulted in estimates of MID ranging from 2. 24 to 3. 10 for the two studies. The <b>anchor</b> <b>based</b> approach resulted in estimates of 3. 21 and 2. 97 for the two studies. Conclusion An MID for the DLQI in the range of 2. 24 to 3. 10 is recommended in interpreting results for patients with CIU. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{anchoring}} heuristic {{refers to}} phenomena when an arbitrary number affects subsequent numerical estimations. Oppenheimer, LeBoeuf and Brewer (2008) {{showed that it}} is not necessary for the anchor to be a numerical value (i. e., the act of drawing lines of different length effectively shifts numerical estimations), yet current models describing the anchoring heuristic do not fully account for the mechanism of non-numerical anchoring. However, this effect shows similarity to the basic anchoring effect - obtained without the comparative question and based on the availability of the given number in working memory. In this study, we attempt to verify whether those two effect share the same psychological mechanism. In Experiment 1, we show that non-numerical <b>anchoring</b> <b>based</b> on magnitude priming cannot be obtained when the lines are just observed. The examined mechanism proves to be dependent on the act of drawing, displaying limitations similar to the basic anchoring effect, previously pointed out by Brewer and Chapman (2002). By using the same numerical anchors in different size formats, in Experiment 2 we showed that <b>anchoring</b> <b>based</b> on magnitude priming occurs even when the numerical values do not affect the estimations.

40|$|This {{research}} {{proposed an}} optimal method of intermediate anchor to prevent premature debonding failure of anchor plate for eliminating premature shear failure of CFRP laminate flexurally strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beam. In the experimental programme, seven RC beam specimens were prepared which included un-strengthened control beam and flexurally strengthened beams with CFRP laminate. The flexurally strengthened beams were further shear strengthened using L-shaped intermediate <b>anchors</b> <b>based</b> on proposed and conventional methods. The experimental results of specimens {{were compared with}} the numerical results. Theoretical model had also been proposed to predict the debonding failure of intermediate anchors. Results showed that the <b>anchors</b> obtained <b>based</b> on the proposed design guideline prevented premature debonding failure of anchor plates completely and thus, the proposed intermediate anchored strengthened beams did not show premature shear failures. Whereas beams having the <b>anchor</b> plates <b>based</b> on conventional method failed by premature debonding of anchor plates followed by premature shear. The proposed intermediate anchors significantly increased the ultimate loads and ductility of the beams as compared to conventional one. It also reduced the number and widths of cracks in shear span. The theoretical model could predict the debonding failure load of intermediate anchor which was comparable with the experimental finding. Finally, numerical model predicted the structural behaviour of proposed intermediate anchored strengthened beams satisfactorily...|$|R
