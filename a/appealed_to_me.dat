25|$|Fallingwater {{stands as}} one of Wright's {{greatest}} masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings. Fallingwater {{has been described as}} an architectural tour de force of Wright's organic philosophy. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between man and nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When I visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{came from}} Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{was the fact that}} the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You could say that Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E
500|$|Patti Smith {{had a great}} {{influence}} on Iyall. [...] " [...] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet," [...] she said. [...] "She combined things I was interested in. Plus, she wasn't a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It looked like something I could do. You didn't have to look {{like all the other}} singers." [...] Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. [...] "I hate rock and roll right now. It's turned into some new kind of stupid [...] religion... I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. [...] Actually, I'll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound. But I'd just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music. I love language – plain speech, used in an enigmatic, subliminal way; I'm not [...] much tied to the literal." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{pursuit of}} his plans, Jardine took advice on fielding {{positions}} from Frank Foster, who had bowled {{a form of}} medium-fast leg theory during the 1911–12 series in Australia with much success, taking 32 wickets at 21.63. Larwood did not at the time consider Jardine's proposed tactics as either novel or controversial. His priority was to contain Bradman, so [...] "any scheme that would keep him in check <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a great deal". In county matches following the Piccadilly Hotel dinner, Larwood and Voce tried the tactics out, with mixed results. Two Essex batsmen sustained injuries as their side struggled with the unfamiliar bowling, at one stage losing 8 wickets for 52 runs. However, Glamorgan, reckoned to be a weak batting side, scored more than 500 against the experimental attack; spectators, including the future cricket writer and commentator John Arlott, were puzzled by the ineffectiveness of the bowling. Arlott later reasoned that what appeared weak bowling on English pitches would be a different proposition on the much faster Australian pitches. Hostile fast bowling was not confined to Larwood and Voce; in Yorkshire's match against Surrey at The Oval, Bill Bowes bowled a series of bouncers, bringing protests from Hobbs and press criticism from Warner.|$|E

[...] In Carmel, she notes that her friendship with muckraker Lincoln Steffens gave her [...] "...much deeper insight into the abuses of laborers and blue-collar workers and made me ready to work for liberal causes when I got to Hollywood a few years later." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} from North Korea, Richardson dealt {{with the issue of}} a pardon for William H. Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, for killing Sheriff William J. Brady of Lincoln County, New Mexico some 130 years ago. [...] Following up on the promise of a pardon at the time by then-territorial {{governor}} Lew Wallace, Richardson said he could not pardon Bonney posthumously because {{he did not want to}} second-guess his predecessor's decision. [...] "It was a very close call", Richardson said. [...] "The romanticism <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to issue a pardon, but the facts and the evidence did not support it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I think I’ve {{always been}} a seeker. All during Fanny I was reading books that really <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> – on Buddhism; all the forms of Hindu asceticism; Chinese Tao; Japanese forms of discipline, both {{physical}} and mental; Sufism; Gurdjieff; Madame Blavatsky; Paramahansa Yogananda; Alan Watts; Carl Jung; Chinese poetry; and so on. What has seemed to take the greatest hold is Buddhism, particularly the Tibetan style. As I’ve learned so often during discourses, {{it all depends on}} one’s karmic predisposition. Mine seems to be constantly investigating, although once I understood the four Noble Truths in conjunction with the Eightfold Path and actually experienced moments of no consciousness; slowly, my life was transformed. Before that, I had a deep feeling of hopelessness. These practices haven’t been easy but pretty brutal to go through in many instances.|$|E
2500|$|Though she {{considered}} herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a keen admirer {{of the leading}} Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came {{two years after the}} death of Henry Clay, Jr., in the Mexican-American War. Crosby recalled that [...] "the great statesman was never quite himself after his son's death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the address of welcome on the day he came to visit us, lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more than I can tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig or Democrat, Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man's eloquence [...] without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It was Monsieur Haussmann who {{impressed}} me the most. It {{was a strange}} thing, but it was less his talents and his remarkable intelligence that <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but the defects in his character. I had {{in front of me}} one of the most extraordinary men of our time; big, strong, vigorous, energetic, {{and at the same time}} clever and devious, with a spirit full of resources. [...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was.... He told me all of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn't at all displeased.... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. [...] Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed.

2500|$|Jones was {{featured}} prominently in Goude's work from that period, [...] "which, {{over the course}} of the '80s, became increasingly synonymous with willful distortion" [...] - using a technique he refers to as [...] "French correction". The artist stated in 2012: [...] "chopping up photos and rearranging them in a montage to elongate limbs or exaggerate the size of someone's head or some other aspect <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on a lot of levels — I'm always searching for equilibrium, symmetry, and rhythm in an image." [...] This distortions [...] "have often been used in service of the objectification and eroticization of black women." [...] Goude's work [...] "centers around artistic depictions of race, ethnicity, and global culture", with an [...] "enchantment with the far-away and the exotic". As a result, much of his depictions of black women are considered controversial and exploitative, as Jones was presented as [...] "a white man's rendition of the African feminine." [...] Goude's images depicted her hypersexualized and androgynous, emphasizing her [...] "blackness" [...] and Jamaican heritage. Writer Abigail Gardner felt Jones' body [...] "was presented and manipulated in ways that are clearly congruent with conceiving of that display as artefactual." [...] Essentially, Hall writes, [...] "Goude treated Jones as an artistic vehicle first and foremost - a hyperbole which, despite destroying their personal relationship, allowed Goude to translate his grandiose vision of Jones the phenomenon into a series of imagery which painted her as a surreal, impossible muse.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{artists have}} cited Fripp as an {{influence}} or have expressed their admiration for him, including Steven Wilson, Omar Rodríguez-López,Omar Rodríguez-López: Selvfølgelig ikke! Jeg gjør faktisk ingen forsøk på å skjule min affekt for Fripps arbeider. [...] ble jeg introdusert for King Crimson, og på nytt kollapset alt, men på en konstruktiv måte. [...] Fripp tryllet i alle fall fram de vakreste toner jeg hadde hørt, og han kunne ikke ha gitt seg til kjenne på et mer gunstig tidspunkt i mitt liv. [...] Ingen kan nekte for at Robert Fripp, også helt tidlig i karrieren, var opptatt av jazz eller de blå notene. Durskalaer og oppstemte gjengroprefrenger har aldri appellert til meg, så da King Crimson ble meg til del var det som å smake på en bit av himmelriket. (Q: You can't deny that you're influenced by Robert Fripp and King Crimson, right?Omar Rodríguez-López: No, of course not! I make {{no attempt to}} hide my affection for Fripps work. [...] I was introduced to King Crimson and again everything collapsed, but in a constructive way. [...] Fripp made the most beautiful notes that I had heard, and he couldn't have been introduced to me at a better time in my life. [...] As soon as someone discovers jazz, it will influence their approach irrespective of which style or band the person concerned contributes to. It can't be denied that Robert Fripp was into jazz throughout his career or the blue notes. The major-scales and euphoric stadium-rock choruses have never <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so when I got familiar with King Crimson's music it was like getting a taste of heaven.) }} Trey Anastasio of Phish, St. Vincent, Kirk Hammett of Metallica,Kirk Hammett: There are fewer 30-part orchestrated guitar sections, fewer massive, bludgeoning riffs perfectly replicated by lames. There are more flexible ideas, more artistic flourishes, more colors. I've probably been influenced in that direction by people like Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew and David Torn. I'm more interested in using guitar sounds as textures and using effects in a more textural fashion. To paraphrase Robert Fripp, I'm more interested in painting a soundscape like he and Adrian Belew do in King Crimson, on Bowie records and in Fripp's solo stuff.

What I like about that is that without a blueprint, it’s just really weird music. Robert Fripp is an astonishingly good guitar player. Just doing the wierdest shit.
