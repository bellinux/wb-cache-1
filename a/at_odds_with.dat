5|$|Keable's {{distinction}} between the historical and the traditional Jesus, Wilson argued, was ultimately muddled and internally inconsistent, his verdicts on the illiberality of the contemporary church <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> his own abiding conviction.|$|E

50|$|At this time, Suzuki was <b>at</b> regular <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Nikkatsu, his studio. He {{would be}} given a project and {{expected}} to direct it in workmanlike fashion, but he consistently introduced stylistic nuances and levels of realism that the studio resented.|$|R

5|$|Tommy {{secured the}} Who's future, {{and made them}} millionaires. The group reacted in {{different}} ways—Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which he felt was <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Meher Baba's ideals, and Moon spent frivolously.|$|E
5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, {{be the result of}} the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E
5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, which was <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> {{the philosophy of}} the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation.

50|$|Despite the union, {{some former}} Progressive Conservative members still {{identify}} themselves as Red Tory, including high-profile political strategist turned Senator Hugh Segal, who in 2013 continued to describe himself as a Red Tory, which has put him <b>at</b> increasing <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the government on several occasions.|$|R
5|$|As well as Groening, Simon {{was often}} <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Brooks and {{production}} company Gracie Films. While working on The Simpsons, he and Brooks had co-created the series Sibs (1991) and Phenom (1993) {{as part of}} a multi-series deal for ABC. Simon did not want to work on either series, both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled, which put a strain on the pair's relationship.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> some of his fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck.

5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> {{the realities of the}} impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
50|$|Vertigo is constitutionally {{required}} to print Office Bearer Reports for the UTS Students' Association Office Bearers {{if they would}} like to inform the student population about their role and activities.

50|$|In the series, Jian-Wa is {{constantly}} {{on the run from}} ruthless Federal Agent Dan Sandler (Jason Adams), the direct superior of the agents killed in the two-hour films.

5|$|In 1912 Shaw {{invested}} £1,000 for a one-fifth {{share in}} the Webbs' new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called the New Statesman, which appeared in April 1913.

5|$|In {{the state}} {{legislative}} elections of 1830, the ascendent Whig Party {{gained control of}} both houses of the General Assembly. Rowan's strict adherence to Jeffersonian democracy and leadership of the New Court faction during the court controversy of the 1820s had put him <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Whig founder Henry Clay. By this time, however, not even Rowan's fellow Democrats endorsed his re-election. Henry Clay was elected instead.|$|E
5|$|Japanese theatre styles {{have been}} applied to The Tempest. In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought his version of The Tempest to the UK.

In 1992, Minoru Fujita presented a Bunraku (Japanese puppet) version in Osaka and at the Tokyo Globe.|$|E
50|$|In his theological-political {{writings}} Datheen {{displays the}} typically optimistic view of early Calvinist {{writers in the}} Netherlands regarding the state, although his very strong views on making sure to avoid all compromise with Roman Catholic guided countries, like Spain, put him <b>at</b> great <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Prince William the Silent (of Orange) and led to Datheen's multiple political ostracizations from his fatherland.|$|R
25|$|Burroughs clearly {{indicates}} {{here that}} {{he prefers to}} be evaluated against such criteria over being reviewed based on the reviewer's personal reactions to a certain book. Always a contradictory figure, Burroughs nevertheless criticized Anatole Broyard for reading authorial intent into his works where there is none, which sets him <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> both <b>with</b> New Criticism and the old school as represented by Mathew Arnold.|$|R

5|$|Moon further {{strengthened}} {{the reversal of}} traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{frequently}} {{commented on the}} recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> a hostile society. The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated. Another recurrent theme is the corruption of innocence, most sharply seen in The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
5|$|Outside her {{political}} duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, accepted the honorary {{presidency of the}} Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate defender of the sport. Her enthusiasm arose in part from her experiences as a juvenile court magistrate; she believed that the sport fostered character and mutual respect.
