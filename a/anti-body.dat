A wheal-and-flare response is a skin eruption that may follow injury or injection of an antigen. It is characterized by swelling and redness caused by a release of histamine. The reaction usually occurs in three stages, beginning {{with the appearance of}} an erythematous area at the site of injury, followed by development of a flare surrounding the site; finally a wheal forms at the site as fluid leaks under the skin from surrounding capillaries. CUS has been categorized as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with IgE (a type of <b>anti-body)</b> playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Investigations dealing with CUS seem to suggest that a percentage of urticarias encompass a contact mechanism.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of an {{increase}} in false positive rates with rapid oral HIV testing in 2005, New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene added the option of testing finger-stick whole blood after any reactive result, before using a western blot test to confirm the positive result. Following a further increase of false positives in NYC DOHMH STD Clinics during the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008, their clinics opted to forgo further oral screenings, and instead reinsituted testing using finger-stick whole blood. Despite the increase in false positives in NYC DOHMH, the CDC still continues to support the use of noninvasive oral fluid specimens due to their popularity in health clinics and convenience of use. The director of the HIV control program for public health at Seattle King county, reported OraQuick failed to spot at least 8 percent of 133 people found to be infected with a comparable diagnostic test. Strategies implemented to determine quality control and false positive rates were implemented. It is to be understood that any reactive OraQuick test result is a preliminary positive result and will always require a confirmatory test, regardless of the mean of testing (venipuncture whole blood, fingerstick whole blood or oral mucosal transudate fluid). Several other testing sites who did not experience a spike in false positive rates continue to use OraSure's OraQuick HIV <b>Anti-body</b> Testing.|$|E

40|$|Objectives : To observe {{physiological}} <b>anti-body</b> {{effects of}} anti-BV, acute toxic response, measurement of LD 50, {{and the effects}} of <b>anti-body</b> were evaluated. Methods : LD 50 of Anti-Bee Venom were measured, and to analyze acute toxic responses, weight, and the <b>anti-body</b> effects various concentrations of Anti-BV were diluted and the survival rate was measured. Cell blood count (CBC), liver, spleen, and kidney pathologies were observed from the histological aspects. Results : Experiment was conducted to observe Anti-BV as the <b>anti-body</b> to the bee venom and the following results were obtained: 1. Anti-BV was injected intraperitoneally and no toxic responses were witnessed. All of the experiment subjects stayed alive during the experiment, making LD 50 analysis impossible. 2. Anti-BV was injected intraperitoneally in mice and no significant weight changes were measured between the control group and the experiment groups. 3. Measuring the concentration dependent survival rate, the highest survival rate was at the concentration of 1. 25 × 102 mg/kg(1 / 2. 000) for Anti-BV. 4. No particular results were shown in the CBC test. 5. Observation of changes in the organ tissues, Anti-BV was found to suppress blood stasis in the liver and inhibit necrosis of the cells.

The {{presence}} of circulating antithyroid <b>anti-bodies</b> {{in a small}} number of patients with Alport's syndrome has led some to suggest that the two abnormalities are associated. If confirmed, such an association could have important diagnostic as well as pathophysiological implications. Using sensitive methods, we assessed the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies in 40 patients with Alport's syndrome from 28 families. Antithyroglobulin antibodies were absent in all patients. Antimicrosomal and antithyro-peroxidase antibodies were absent in all but one patient.

40|$|Abstract: Eosinophils {{are known}} to express cyto-kines capable of {{promoting}} fibrosis. Interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) is important in regulating eosinophilopoiesis, eosinophil recruitment and activation. Lung IL- 5 expression is elevated in pulmonary fibrosis, wherein the eosinophil is a primary source of fibrogenic cytokines. To determine the role of IL- 5 in pulmonary fibrosis, the effects of anti-IL- 5 <b>anti-body</b> were investigated in a model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis was induced in mice by endotracheal bleomycin treatment. Ani-mals were also treated with either anti-IL- 5 <b>anti-body</b> or control IgG. Lungs were then analyzed for fibrosis, eosinophil influx, chemotactic activity, and cytokine expression. The results show that a primary chemotactic activity {{at the height of}} eosino-phil recruitment is IL- 5. Furthermore, anti-IL- 5 antibody caused significant reduction in lung eosino-philia, cytokine expression, and fibrosis. These findings taken together suggest an important role for IL- 5 in pulmonary fibrosis via its ability to regulate eosinophilic inflammation, and thus eosino-phil-dependent fibrogenic cytokine production...|$|E
