Aron was made to pay a total of 160–162 million ISK with interest to Arion Bank, Glitnir's winding-up board and Íslandsbanki in addition to <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> costs. The 96–97 million ISK profit of the fraud held by Aron's real estate company, AK fasteignafélag, was confiscated. The Supreme Court of Iceland increased his sentence to 2 {{and a half years}} in prison.|$|E
5|$|The Australia Act 1986 ended <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> {{ties between}} Australia and the United Kingdom. The Act, {{enacted by the}} Parliament of Australia and the Parliament of the United Kingdom, ended {{the ability of the}} United Kingdom to make laws for Australia or employ the {{doctrine}} of repugnancy, and stopped all remaining avenues of appeal to the Privy Council from Australian courts, unless authorised by the High Court of Australia.|$|E

5|$|After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{ruled in}} his favour, {{the book was}} made {{available}} in the UK. However following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from the book, {{on the grounds that}} the government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> objection to the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E

5|$|It {{appeared}} that Brooks had exhausted <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, {{this time with}} the Pulaski County district court. Under Arkansas Civil Code sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an action at law may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to the office. On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{likewise}} {{identified the}} origin and ownership of documents and buildings with seals, which were typically a pointed oval called a vesica to distinguish from round seals in non-religious use. Edward I of England decreed in 1307 that <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> documents required a seal. These seals initially depicted a person, but as secular seals began to depict only a shield, clergy likewise used seals with heraldic insignia. Personal seals of bishops and abbots continued to be used after their deaths, gradually becoming an impersonal seal. Clergy tended to replace military devices with clerical devices. The shield was retained, but ecclesiastical hats often replaced helmets and coronets. In some religious arms a skull replaces the helmet.|$|E
5|$|The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a {{new company}} of actors, though they were less {{experienced}} and talented than the old crew. The majority of old actors moved to the Little Theatre, Haymarket, though a few remained loyal. Henry Fielding sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal, though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute. By the end of 1733, the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre's property and Highmore, the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time, lost <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> abilities to stop them. By February 1734, he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made {{an agreement with the}} actors that secured their return.|$|E

5|$|While {{some see}} {{speaking}} {{their native language}} as {{an important part of}} their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from €118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day. Some see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage, although there has been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> texts, {{due to the fact that}} it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.|$|E
5|$|Charles II's father, Charles I, was {{executed}} at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at {{the climax of}} the English Civil War. Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a de facto republic, led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland, and Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> documents were dated as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649.|$|E
5|$|Cohen {{thereafter}} {{launched a}} media offensive claiming the DRS was biased {{in favor of}} large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet. Cohen stated {{he believed that the}} DRS system was unfair {{for a number of reasons}} and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review. Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings for judicial review. The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service. Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a rehearing and, as that case progressed, the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> action against Apple.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E

5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to become the next signor of Florence. Walter later suspended <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court hearing {{took place}} on 11 February 2008 – only {{two days before the}} series was due to premiere. The Nine Network was ordered by a DPP {{subpoena}} to hand over tapes of all 13 episodes, as well as outlines and story lines, to the Victorian Supreme Court by 10am on that date. The Nine Network refused to voluntarily hand over the tapes, saying they were incomplete and that the network's lawyers were closely supervising production. However, it was willing to comply with any Court order and took the matter very seriously. The Network was also adamant that the series makes no assertions about the guilt of the accused killer. At the hearing, which took place at the Geelong Supreme Court, Justice Betty King gave prosecution and defence lawyers 24hours to view the series and return to court the following day to decide whether it had the potential to affect the forthcoming trial. Justice King issued a suppression order on 12 February banning the Nine Network from broadcasting the series in the state of Victoria and on the internet until after the murder trial was completed. The Nine Network offered to air a heavily edited version in Victoria, but the offer was rejected by Justice King. It was initially planned that an alternative program, Underbelly: A Special Announcement, discussing {{the subject matter of the}} series, would air in Victoria instead of the series premiere. This idea was scrapped, and the movie The Shawshank Redemption was aired in Victoria instead. The Nine Network declared their intention to appeal the decision, and Network lawyers stated that they would exercise <b>all</b> <b>legal</b> options.|$|E
