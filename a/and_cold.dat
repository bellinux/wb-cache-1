5|$|Winters are mild with {{frequent}} frosts <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> spells. Temperatures are usually mild {{during the day}} <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> during the night. Most precipitation results from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and sudestada, which bring long periods of precipitation, cloudiness and cooler temperatures, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. Dull, gray and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Occasionally, tropical air masses from the north may move southward, providing relief from the cool, damp temperatures. Snowfall is extremely rare. When it does snow, it usually lasts for only a day or two.|$|E

Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
