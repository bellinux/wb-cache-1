25|$|Breedon priory {{was founded}} as an Augustinian monastery in around 1120, {{on the site}} of the earlier Saxon Benedictine abbey of Holy Hill Monastery. The priory was a cell of Nostell Priory in Yorkshire <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to have been between three and five canons in {{residence}} at any one time, usually from Nostell.

25|$|The Code {{regulates the}} feudal {{position}} of certain classes. They held an estate from the king, {{consisting of a}} house, a garden, a field, stock, and a salary, on condition of personal service on the king's errand. They could not delegate the service, on penalty of death. When ordered abroad, they could nominate a capable son to hold the benefice and carry on the duty. If there was no capable son, the state put in a locum tenens but granted one-third to the wife to maintain herself and her children. The fief was otherwise inalienable; {{it could not be}} sold, pledged, exchanged, sublet, devised or diminished. Other land was leased from the state. Ancestral estate was strictly tied to the family. If a holder would sell, the family kept the right of redemption, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to have been no time limit to its exercise.|$|E

25|$|Unihemispheric sleep {{refers to}} {{sleeping}} {{with only a}} single cerebral hemisphere. The phenomenon has been observed in birds and aquatic mammals, {{as well as in}} several reptilian species (the latter being disputed: many reptiles behave in a way which could be construed as unihemispheric sleeping, but EEG studies have given contradictory results). Reasons for the development of unihemispheric sleep are likely that it enables the sleeping animal to receive stimuli—threats, for instance—from its environment, and that it enables the animal to fly or periodically surface to breathe when immersed in water. Only NREM sleep exists unihemispherically, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to exist a continuum in unihemispheric sleep regarding the differences in the hemispheres: in animals exhibiting unihemispheric sleep, conditions range from one hemisphere being in deep sleep with the other hemisphere being awake to one hemisphere sleeping lightly with the other hemisphere being awake. If one hemisphere is selectively deprived of sleep in an animal exhibiting unihemispheric sleep (one hemisphere is allowed to sleep freely but the other is awoken whenever it falls asleep), the amount of deep sleep will selectively increase in the hemisphere that was deprived of sleep when both hemispheres are allowed to sleep freely.|$|E

2500|$|Pirates are a {{frequent}} topic in fiction and, in their Caribbean incarnation, {{are associated with}} certain stereotypical manners of speaking and dress, some of them wholly fictional: [...] "nearly all our notions of their behavior come from {{the golden age of}} fictional piracy, which reached its zenith in 1881 with the appearance of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island." [...] Hugely influential in shaping the popular conception of pirates, Captain Charles Johnson's A General History of the Pyrates, published in London in 1724, is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age. The book gives an almost mythical status to pirates, with naval historian David Cordingly writing: [...] "it has been said, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although some of {{the details}} are often misremembered, the effect upon popular culture of the Golden Age of Piracy can hardly be overstated. A General History of the Pirates (1724) by Captain Charles Johnson is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age, {{providing}} an extensive account of the period. In giving an almost mythical status to the more colourful characters such as the notorious English pirates Blackbeard and Calico Jack, {{it is likely that the}} author used considerable licence in his accounts of pirate conversations. In 2002, English naval historian David Cordingly wrote an introduction to Johnson's 1724 book, stating: [...] "it has been said, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates." [...] Johnson's book would influence the pirate literature of Robert Louis Stevenson and J. M. Barrie. Such literary works as Stevenson's Treasure Island and Barrie's Peter Pan, while romanticized, drew heavily on pirates and piracy for their plots.|$|E

[...] What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a Pythagorean and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice, and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet. [...] A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native Asia Minor (Turkey) and of northern Syria, in particular his home town of Tyana, Ephesus, Aegae, and Antioch, though the letters suggest wider travels, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome. [...] As for his philosophical convictions, we have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (On sacrifices), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving nous (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.|$|E
