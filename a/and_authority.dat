5|$|The {{practical}} {{source of}} an emperor's power <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> was the military. The legionaries were {{paid by the}} Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor (sacramentum). The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the donativum, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.|$|E

Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure <b>and</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E

5|$|Corrector totius orientis (governor of {{the entire}} East): it is {{generally}} accepted by modern scholars that he bore this title. The corrector had an overall command of the Roman armies <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> over the Roman provincial governors in the designated region. There are no known attestations of the title during Odaenathus' lifetime. Evidences for the king bearing the title are two inscriptions in Palmyrene dialect; one posthumous dedication describing him as MTQNNʿ of the East (derived from the Aramaic root TQN, meaning to set in order), and the other describing his heir Vaballathus with the same title albeit using the word PNRTTʿ instead of MTQNNʿ.|$|E
5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power <b>and</b> <b>authority.</b> The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated {{with the idea of}} a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E
5|$|In 1095, at the Council of Piacenza, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos {{requested}} {{military aid}} from Pope Urban II, {{probably in the}} form of a small body of mercenary reinforcements he could direct and control. Alexios had restored the Empire's finances <b>and</b> <b>authority,</b> but he still faced a number of foreign enemies, particularly the migrating Turks who had colonised the sparsely populated areas of Anatolia. At the Council of Clermont later that year, Urban raised the issue again and preached for a Crusade. Many historians consider that Urban also hoped that aiding the Eastern Church would lead to its reunion with the Western under his leadership.|$|E

5|$|In Anglo-Saxon society, noblewomen enjoyed {{considerable}} {{rights and}} status, although the society was still firmly patriarchal. Some exercised power as abbesses, exerting widespread influence across the early English Church, although their wealth <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> diminished with the monastic {{reforms of the}} 9th century. Anglo-Saxon queens began to hold lands {{in their own right}} in the 10th century and their households contributed to the running of the kingdom. Although women could not lead military forces, in the absence of their husbands some noblewomen led the defence of manors and towns. Most Anglo-Saxon women, however, worked on the land as part of the agricultural community, or as brewers or bakers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Gaveston's death, however, civil conflict in England rarely seemed far away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a safe distance away from Edward's forces in the south. He also probably hoped to erect a prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth <b>and</b> <b>authority,</b> and challenging that of the King. He may perhaps also have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.|$|E
5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender <b>and</b> <b>authority.</b> However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{influence}} {{continued to}} affect Mari's culture during the Amorite period, which {{is evident in}} the Babylonian scribal style used in the city. However, it was less influential than the former periods and a distinct Syrian style prevailed, which is noticeable in the seals of kings, which reflect a clear Syrian origin. The society was a tribal one, it consisted mostly of farmers and nomads (Haneans), and in contrast to Mesopotamia, the temple had a minor role in everyday life as the power was mostly invested in the palace. Women enjoyed a relative equality to men, queen Shibtu ruled in her husband's name while he was away, and had an extensive administrative role <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> over her husband's highest officials.|$|E

5|$|On 20 July 1944, a {{group of}} German army {{officers}} led by Claus von Stauffenberg and {{including some of the}} highest-ranked members of the German armed forces attempted to assassinate Hitler, but failed to do so. The next day, Himmler formed a special commission that arrested over 5,000 suspected and known opponents of the regime. Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people. Though Himmler was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot, it led to an increase in his powers <b>and</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|Power was now wielded by {{the senior}} bureaucrats, who {{installed}} {{the weak and}} pliable al-Muqtadir on the throne. Over the next decades, the expenditure of both the court and the army increased, while maladministration and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified. By 932, when al-Muqtadir was assassinated, the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt, <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> soon devolved {{on a series of}} military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of amīr al-umarāʾ. This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, who put an end to caliphal independence even in name. Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads, but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources.|$|E
5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside.

The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E
