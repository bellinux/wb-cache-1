5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him {{to work with a}} crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> actual battle.|$|E

25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example we give our students nowadays is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten {{with the development of}} the digital theory.|$|E
25|$|Type-III binary {{compounds}} are covalently bonded. Covalent bonding occurs between nonmetal elements. Covalently-bonded compounds {{are also}} known as molecules. In the compound, the first element is named first and with its full elemental name. The second element is named <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> anion (root name of the element + -ide suffix). Then, prefixes are used to indicate the numbers of each atom present: these prefixes are mono- (one), di- (two), tri- (three), tetra- (four), penta- (five), hexa- (six), hepta- (seven), octa- (eight), nona- (nine), and deca- (ten). The prefix mono- is never used with the first element. Thus, NCl3 is called nitrogen trichloride, P2O5 is called diphosphorus pentoxide (the a of the penta- prefix is dropped before the vowel for easier pronunciation), and BF3 is called boron trifluoride.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} S2 is negative, {{indicating}} that the image is formed {{on the opposite side}} of the lens from where those rays are being considered. Since the diverging light rays emanating from the lens never come into focus, and those rays are not physically present at the point where they appear to form an image, this is called a virtual image. Unlike real images, a virtual image cannot be projected on a screen, but appears to an observer looking through the lens as if it were a real object at the location of that virtual image. Likewise, it appears to a subsequent lens <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> object at that location, so that second lens could again focus that light into a real image, S1 then being measured from the virtual image location behind the first lens to the second lens. This is exactly what the eye does when looking through a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass creates a (magnified) virtual image behind the magnifying glass, but those rays are then re-imaged by the lens of the eye to create a real image on the retina.|$|E

Beyoncé explained the concept for the video was to show a different side to her, that the paparazzi does not show and that fans would not normally see. Beyoncé performed [...] "Flaws and All" [...] on The Beyoncé Experience (2007), and the song was included on the live album The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007). It was also sung live on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2008 and during Beyoncé's show [...] in May 2012.|$|E
500|$|The film {{introduces}} {{a vehicle that}} has been compared with the Batplane and the Batcopter, dubbed [...] "the Bat". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> actual military project, emphasising the need for it to [...] "fit into the same family" [...] as the Tumbler and the Batpod. The {{final version of the}} Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat [...] "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.|$|E
500|$|Following Simpson's divorce {{hearing on}} 27 October 1936, her solicitor, John Theodore Goddard, became {{concerned}} {{that there would}} be a [...] "patriotic" [...] citizen's intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful. The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce (a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties), and so the case was being handled <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> undefended at-fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson, with Wallis Simpson as the innocent, injured party. The divorce action would fail if the citizen's intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by, for example, conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7 December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing that the visit might put doubts in Simpson's mind. Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes.|$|E

500|$|The rabbi's {{defenders}} strongly {{objected to}} the decision. His primary supporter, synagogue vice president Louis Jackson, who had broken the story to the press, described the congregation as a [...] "collection of jackasses", with the [...] "chief jackass" [...] being the president Louis Schwartz, who Jackson accused of eating ham himself, and of stealing from the synagogue's charity boxes. Jackson was expelled from the congregation, and subsequently convicted of libel and fined $100 (today $) for making the accusations, while Rosenberg sued the synagogue for his salary. Rosenberg died of pneumonia in April 1893, {{at the age of}} 43, his [...] "health and spirits", according to a contemporary New York Times report, [...] "broken" [...] by the expulsion. At the funeral, Jackson berated the congregation's members, who, he charged, had [...] "hounded, hunted, driven [...] to a grave of misery", and allegedly threatened to kill one of them with a stone taken from the newly dug grave.

500|$|Arguments for {{it being}} legally binding {{is based on}} several points. Firstly, the {{judiciary}} of the time were asked by Charles what standing they would give to the Petition were it passed; they concluded {{that it was a}} potentially legislative act. Charles's assent to the Petition was also made in Parliament, not in Whitehall, something normally done with statutes, and Henry Elsynge, the Clerk of the House of Commons, had the Petition placed on the statute rolls <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> Act of Parliament. It was later enforced by the courts; when Selden and other Members of Parliament were imprisoned, they cited the Petition as a reason to grant habeas corpus, something the judges accepted, and the ship money case, although a victory for Charles, was a victory in spite of the Petition rather than because of it; the judgment concluded that Charles's actions were acceptable under the Royal Prerogative, but would otherwise be in violation of the Petition. The final word remains elusive, since [...] "it seems impossible to establish conclusively which of these interpretations of the petition is correct. The Petition of Right of 1628 was a unique parliamentary act. It was interpreted differently by different people. And there are probably no absolute criteria by which its true nature can be determined".|$|E
500|$|The four-piece band {{struggled}} {{to come up}} with new material for an album, but in February 1968 recorded Wright's [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] and Waters' [...] "Julia Dream". In early February it was announced that the Waters-penned track, [...] "Corporal Clegg" [...] would be the band's next single, however, due to pressure from the label, the song was earmarked for the album, and [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] was released in April as a single, with [...] "Julia Dream" [...] on the B-side. Throughout April, the band was taking stock of the songs recorded up to that point. Waters blocked the release of the two tracks, [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] and [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream", on the album, though the band retained [...] "Jugband Blues", and the Waters-written [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] on which Barrett played. With not enough material to fill the album's last 12 minutes, the band started piecing together several pieces of material that was to become the title track of the album, [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets". Mason and Waters planned the track out <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> architectural design, including peaks and troughs. Producer Smith didn't like the song, stating to them that they [...] "just can't do this, it's too long. You have to write three-minute songs." [...] On 25 June, the band recorded another session for BBC Radio's Top Gear; the session featured two tracks from Saucerful: [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] and a shortened retitled version of the title track, titled here as [...] "The Massed Gadgets of Hercules".|$|E

500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a word about it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E
