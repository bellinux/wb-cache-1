Bonnybridge now had three stations.|$|R

5|$|According to James, Anne {{wrote to}} him in 1696 {{requesting}} his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James's line at <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> opportunity; he declined to give his consent.

5|$|After Francia's death he was {{succeeded by}} Carlos Antonio López, (called ‘López I’ by some authors, <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> if {{inaccurate}} designation), {{the father of}} Francisco Solano López (‘López II’). López I did open up Paraguay to foreign trade and technology, but the steamship made his country vulnerable to invasion and he understandably feared the machinations of his powerful neighbours.|$|E

5|$|In 1990 Tseung Kwan O Tunnel {{was built}} with its {{southern}} entrance in Lam Tin, adding <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> and direct route to Tseung Kwan O. Junk Bay Chinese Permanent Cemetery {{was built in}} the same year. Despite being located in Tseung Kwan O, the cemetery's only motor-enabled exit is located in Lam Tin. As a result, Lam Tin becomes crowded with people tending graves during the various festivals.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{constant}} difficulties of London orchestras {{was the lack of}} good rehearsal space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E

5|$|The {{aristocracy}} shunned the City {{and lived}} {{either in the}} countryside beyond the slum suburbs, or in the exclusive Westminster district (the modern West End), the site of Charles II's court at Whitehall. Wealthy people preferred to live at <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> distance from the traffic-clogged, polluted, unhealthy City, especially after it {{was hit by a}} devastating outbreak of bubonic plague in the Plague Year of 1665.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} to Golders Green {{would take the}} railway out of the urban and suburban areas and into open farmland. While this provided <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> site for the CCE's depot {{it is believed that}} underlying the decision was Yerkes' plan to profit from the sale of development land previously purchased in the area that would rise in value when the railway opened.|$|E
5|$|The lack of good {{rehearsal}} {{facilities to}} which Bernstein had objected was {{addressed in the}} 1970s when, jointly with the LPO, the LSO acquired and restored a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E
30|$|Further {{evidence}} {{of the significance of}} the smell of books in the collective olfactory memory is the number of scented products themed on books and libraries (over 30 candles, perfumes and oils) available from a single London store in 2015. <b>As</b> <b>convenient</b> as e-readers may be, many readers long for the nostalgia that the smell of a book can evoke [56].|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>convenient</b> {{means of}} {{determining}} {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

Sucre Plaza (Spanish: Plaza Sucre) – graced since 1915 with a ceiba tree {{at its center}} – is {{in the southern part}} of town; this was historically where people tied their mules while frequenting The Four Corners, and it is also known as Plaza La Ceiba. The Four Corners (Spanish: Las Cuatro Esquinas) was <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> social gathering spot in El Hatillo, comprising a general store, hardware shop, gambling place and bar.|$|E
5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, but it is <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, {{as it could be}} counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing <b>a</b> <b>convenient</b> point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
