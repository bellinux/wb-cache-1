5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being {{prepared}} for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He {{was standing in the doorway}} of the platoon headquarters, having <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death. The {{builders}} left a cavity into the wall and the poor girl with a piece of bread and <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E
25|$|Bovril {{holds the}} unusual {{position}} of having been advertised with a Pope. An advertising campaign of the early 20th century in Britain depicted Pope Leo XIII seated on his throne, bearing <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> Bovril. The campaign slogan read: The Two Infallible Powers – The Pope & Bovril.|$|E

25|$|Marmite is {{traditionally}} eaten as a savoury spread on bread, toast, savoury biscuits or crackers, {{and other similar}} baked products. Owing to its concentrated taste it is often spread thinly with butter or margarine. Marmite can also {{be made into a}} savoury hot drink by adding one teaspoon to <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> hot water much like Oxo and Bovril.|$|E
25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a man {{sitting at a}} table upon which is placed <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer. The man, an American according to the title of the work, has his arms crossed and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on the wall behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E
500|$|Former Postmaster General Amos Kendall, {{who managed}} Van Buren's {{re-election}} campaign, instructed that Democrats should {{not try to}} defend the administration, but should focus on attacking the opposing party's presidential candidate. [...] By the end of May 1840, Harrison had made no public appearances that year. Even {{though there was a}} custom that presidential contenders did not campaign, he was still mocked by the Democratic press. One article alleged he had been shut up in an iron cage with <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> hard cider, and that he was seeking help from the abolitionists to get released. As was usual for candidates of that era, he made his views known by answering letters from citizens, knowing that some would be reprinted in newspapers. However, Harrison felt that he needed to speak out, and accepted an invitation to make an address at the June 13 anniversary of the 1813 Siege of Fort Meigs, where he and his troops had held out against British and Native American forces. En route to Perrysburg, when leaving his hotel in Columbus, he made what Shafer called [...] "the first presidential campaign speech in history", speaking to a small crowd of supporters, and defending his record against what he deemed personal attacks. In his Fort Meigs speech, Harrison told the crowd, [...] "See that the Government does not acquire too much power. Keep check upon your rulers. Do this, and liberty is safe." [...] Harrison had planned additional speeches, but his swing was cut short when news arrived of the death of his son Benjamin from tuberculosis. He returned home {{to take care of his}} wife, and did not make another speech until July 28.|$|E

50|$|The new Secret Committee then hires The Profile, an amoral {{character}} who can analyze a persona pas and future habits with a glance, {{to help them}} entrap Moon Knight. He escapes after the plan collapses because they authorized <b>a</b> <b>mugging</b> <b>of</b> Frenchie too soon. Profile then becomes a reluctant source of information for Spector himself, even giving him advise on rekindling his relationship with Marlene.|$|R

2500|$|In 1995, Drummond and Cauty unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to recruit Robbie Williams to sing {{on a track}} they were donating to The Help Album; Williams was on holiday and unavailable. Drummond outlined their idea—which mirrors [...] "Whitney Joins The JAMs"—in a chapter of his book 45 entitled [...] "Robbie Joins The Jams": [...] "Over <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> tea Jimmy [...] and I got it all worked out. [...] We would record our version of 'The Magnificent Seven', renamed 'The Magnificent One', through Sunday night. Over the track I would beseech Robbie Williams to join The Jams, and then Robbie would in fact turn up at the studio {{in the early hours}} of Monday morning and make his creative contribution to the record." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Frenchman, a German, and a Russian go on a safari and are {{captured}} by cannibals. They {{are brought to}} the chief, who says, [...] "We are going to eat you right now. But I am a civilized man, I studied human rights at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, so I'll grant each of you a last request." [...] The German asks for <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer and a bratwurst. He gets it, and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers {{the fate of the}} German. The Russian demands: [...] "Hit me hard, right on my nose!" [...] The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals. The mortally-wounded chief asks him: [...] "Why didn't you do this before we ate the German?" [...] The Russian proudly replies: [...] "Russians are not aggressors!" [...] (This joke has also been used as a Jewish joke; more specifically, as an Israeli joke, alluding to Israel's being constantly afraid of being seen as the [...] "aggressor".) ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Yale's {{buildings}} were {{constructed in the}} Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School. Stone sculpture built into {{the walls of the}} buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with <b>a</b> <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them {{in the style of the}} Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, [...] tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.|$|E
60|$|Later {{in the day}} Magdalen {{found an}} {{opportunity}} of applying to old Mazey himself. She discovered the veteran in high good humor, smoking his pipe, and warming <b>a</b> tin <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> ale at his own snug fire.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour afterward, {{with a big}} {{plate of}} moose-steak before him and <b>a</b> big <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> coffee at his lips, Smoke half-started up from his seat. He had heard the sounds first. Lucy threw open the door.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{a sort of}} owl, always flying {{about at}} night. Yes, your foot is like fire; the {{bandages}} must be wet again," [...] and away flapped the maternal owl for more cooling stuff, and <b>a</b> great <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> ice water.|$|R

6000|$|Then, again, {{though the}} food be {{wholesome}} and in proper amount, {{we know that}} we must not consume too many kinds at once. Take the thirsty a quart of beer, or a quart of cider, or even a quart of cold tea, and he will probably thank you (though not so heartily in the last case!). But what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing <b>a</b> little <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> beer, <b>a</b> little <b>mug</b> <b>of</b> cider, another of cold tea, one of hot tea, one of coffee, one of cocoa, and corresponding vessels of milk, water, brandy-and-water, and butter-milk? The sum total might be a quart, but would it be the same thing to the haymaker? ...|$|R
