40|$|We {{present a}} general {{technique}} for dynamizing {{a class of}} problems whose underlying structure is a computation graph embedded in a tree. We introduce three fully dynamic data structures, called path <b>attribute</b> <b>systems,</b> tree <b>attribute</b> <b>systems,</b> and linear <b>attribute</b> grammars, which extend and generalize the dynamic trees of Sleator and Tarjan. More specifically, we associate values, called attributes, with the nodes and paths of a rooted tree. Path attributes form a path <b>attribute</b> <b>system</b> {{if they can be}} maintained in constant time under path concatenation. Node attributes form a tree <b>attribute</b> <b>system</b> if the tree attributes of the tail of a path � can be determined in constant time from the path attributes of �. A linear attribute grammar is a tree-based linear expression such that the values of a node µ are calculated from the values at the parent, siblings, and/or children of µ. We provide a framework for maintaining path <b>attribute</b> <b>systems,</b> tree <b>attribute</b> <b>systems,</b> and linear <b>attribute</b> grammars in a fully dynamic environment using linear space and logarithmic time per operation. Also, we demonstrate the applicability of our techniques by showing examples of graph and geometric problems that can be efficiently dynamized, including biconnectivity and triconnectivity queries, planarity testing, drawing trees and series-parallel digraphs, slicing floorplan compaction, point location, and many optimization problems on bounded tree-width graphs...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{dimension}} of VSM (Vector Space Model) for information retrieval and clustering, this paper proposes a new method, Semantic-VSM, which uses the Semantic <b>Attribute</b> <b>System</b> defined by ”A-Japanese-Lexicon ” instead of literal words used in conventional VSM. The <b>attribute</b> <b>system</b> consists of a tree structure with 2, 710 attributes, which includes 400 thousand literal words. Using this <b>attribute</b> <b>system,</b> the generalization of vector elements can be performed easily based on upper-lower relationships of semantic attributes, so that the dimension can easily be reduced at very low cost. Synonyms are automatically assessed through semantic attributes to improve the recall performance of retrieval systems. Experimental results applying it to BMIR-J 2 database of 5, 079 newspaper articles showed that the dimension can be reduced from 2, 710 to 300 or 600 with only a small degradation in performance. High recall performance was also shown compared with conventional VSM. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{relationship}} between the characteristics or attributes of a military weapon system (e. g., speed, reliability, survivability) and the effectiveness of that system is thoroughly examined. Success in system acquisition relies on (1) the early identification and successful incorporation of those <b>system</b> <b>attributes</b> that are critical to system effectiveness, and (2) the specification of numerical values for the <b>system</b> <b>attributes</b> (the <b>system</b> requirements) that maximizes system effectiveness at an acceptable cost. New definitions for <b>system,</b> <b>system</b> <b>attributes,</b> and <b>system</b> effectiveness, as well as relevant DoDI 5000. 2 guidance are provided. In addition to the currently- mandated battle level at which system effectiveness should be measured (in terms of engagement or battle outcomes), the author uses a wide spectrum of system acquisition-related literature to advocate that system effectiveness should also be measured at the mission level (in terms of mission outcome). Several existing mathematical models which combine a few key <b>system</b> <b>attribute</b> measurements into single-number measures of system effectiveness in accomplishing a particular mission are described. Then, the author proposes a hierarchy or tree which relates many <b>system</b> <b>attributes</b> to the four key attributes, Availability, Reliability, Survivability, and Capability, and hence to system effectiveness in accomplishing a specified mission.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} changes in knowledge before and after a mass media campaign, in relation to social <b>attributes,</b> care <b>system</b> <b>attributes</b> and oral health aspects. The study was based on a questionnaire in a cohort design, sent out to 900 randomly sampled people aged 50 – 75 in Sweden. The response rate to the questionnaire before and after the campaign was 70 % and 65 % respectively. Sixty-four percent answered both questionnaires. Two questions addressed knowledge, while 10 questions aimed to measure social <b>attributes,</b> care <b>system</b> <b>attributes</b> and oral health aspects. Data were analysed for bivariate relations as to change in knowledge and social <b>attributes,</b> care <b>system</b> <b>attributes</b> and oral health aspects. Data were also analysed in multiple regression analysis with knowledge before, knowledge after and knowledge differences as dependent variables. The results showed that there were a number of independent variables with inﬂuence on the dependent variables. Of the social attributes, secondary education gave almost 10 % (P< 0. 001) better knowledge both before and after the campaign. Among care <b>system</b> <b>attributes,</b> high care utilization was related to knowledge both before and after the campaign. The most important factors for knowledge about periodontitis were education, care utilization and perceived importance of oral health. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that mass media might increase knowledge about periodontitis as a health promotion strategy...|$|R
