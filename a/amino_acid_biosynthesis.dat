The obtained results indicated, in general, that growth and the studied physiological activities, except <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>biosynthesis,</b> of both Chlorococcum and Chlorella were inhibited by crude extracts of the two cyanobacteria species Microcystis and Nodularia.

The prevalence of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, especially methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus has caused serious public health concerns. The limited {{options for the}} treatment of multidrug resistant S. aureus infections highlight the urgent need for the identification of novel target and the development of new classes antimicrobial agents. The highly conserved gcp operon is a potential target, as it is essential for all tested bacteria. However, the mechanism behind this essentiality is not clear. In this study, we constructed defined Pspac-regulated gcp or yeaZ expression mutant in wild type MRSA strains and demonstrated the essentiality of Gcp and YeaZ for S. aureus growth in culture. Moreover, we demonstrated that Gcp interacts with YeaZ using both a yeast two-hybrid and a bacterial two-hybrid system, and in vitro pull down assays. To characterize the Gcp-YeaZ interaction, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis on charged or polarized <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of the C-terminal segment of Gcp and revealed that the C-terminal Y 317 -F 322 region was critical for Gcp binding to YeaZ {{as well as for the}} essentiality of Gcp for growth. Taken together, our data suggest that the interaction of Gcp and YeaZ may contribute to the essentiality of Gcp for S. aureus survival. In addition, we demonstrated that Gcp and YeaZ play important roles in the regulation of branched-chain <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway. Specifically, using qPCR and an ilv-promoter luciferase reporter fusion, we found that the depletion of Gcp or YeaZ dramatically increased the transcription of the ilv-leu operon that encodes key enzymes responsible for the <b>biosynthesis</b> of branched-chain <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Moreover, gel shift analyses showed that Gcp lacked a DNA-binding capacity, whereas YeaZ was able to bind the ilv promoter region, indicating that Gcp indirectly, but YeaZ directly control the transcription of ilv-leu operon. Furthermore, we found that Gcp and YeaZ are involved in the biosynthesis of N 6 -threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t 6 A). In addition, the depletion of Gcp or YeaZ enhanced bacterial growth in culture medium lacking ILV. To elucidate whether the tight regulation of branched-chain <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway contributed to the essentiality of Gcp and YeaZ, we created an ilv-leu operon deletion mutant using the defined Pspac-regulated gcp or yeaZ expression strains and found that the deletion of ilv-leu operon had no impact on the requirement of Gcp and YeaZ for bacterial growth. The above data indicate that the essential nature of Gcp and YeaZ is not attributable to their repression of the ilv-leu operon. These new findings provide new insights into the biological function of these essential proteins, Gcp and YeaZ, as well as the regulatory mechanism of branched-chain <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>biosynthesis...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} the energy source {{that drives the}} <b>biosynthesis</b> of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> lipids, and nucleotides from glucose, we calculated the free energy change due to redox disproportionation of the substrate carbon of: (1) 26 -carbon fermentation reactions and (2) the <b>biosynthesis</b> of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and lipids of E. coli from glucose. The free energy (cal/mmol of carbon) of these reactions was plotted {{as a function of}} the degree of redox disproportionation of carbon (disproportionative electron transfers (mmol) /mmol of carbon). The zero intercept and proportionality between energy yield and degree of redox disproportionation exhibited by this plot demonstrate that redox disproportionation is the principal energy source of these redox reactions (slope of linear fit = - 10. 4 cal/mmol of disproportionative electron transfers). The energy and disproportionation values of E. coli <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> and lipid <b>biosynthesis</b> from glucose lie near this linear curve fit with redox disproportionation accounting for 84 % and 96 % (and ATP only 6 % and 1 %) of the total energy of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> and lipid <b>biosynthesis,</b> respectively. These observations establish that redox disproportionation of carbon, and not ATP, is the primary energy source driving <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> and lipid <b>biosynthesis</b> from glucose. In contrast, we found that nucleotide biosynthesis involves very little redox disproportionation, and consequently depends almost entirely on ATP for energy. The function of sugar redox disproportionation as the major source of free energy for the <b>biosynthesis</b> of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and lipids suggests that sugar disproportionation played a central role in the origin of metabolism, and probably the origin of life...|$|R

30|$|The {{homology}} search made {{it possible}} to identify two enzymes, HSK and HAT, utilizing homoserine as precursor to direct this compound into pathways forming either threonine or homocysteine, respectively. The analysis does not allow to rule out that similar to yeast acetylated homoserine is the acceptor for reduced sulfur from sulfur assimilation pathway. To proof this finding and specify the true catalytic properties of the PLP-enzymes (CbL-like, CgS-like, and MgL-like) further biochemical studies have to be done. Moreover, the identification of a common motif in promoter regions of 15 genes involved in methionine metabolism of T. pseudonana suggests evolutionary conservation of the regulatory mechanism of the pathway. This finding, together with the homoserine acetyltransferase gene supports the hypothesis of the residual “fungal-type” of sulfur <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway in diatoms (Bromke and Hesse 2013). Phylogenetic consideration revealed that in T. pseudonana methionine synthase represents the MetH type of identified methionine synthases requiring cobalamin as cofactor.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} predict gene {{knockout}} effects for the cell growth by utilizing bi-ological databases such as KEGG and EcoCyc, in which biological knowledge and experimental results have been col-lected. At first, biological networks are constructed from such databases and configure experimental conditions by giving source metabolites, target metabolites, and knockout genes. All minimal active pathways are then enumerated, which are minimal subsets of a given network using source metabolites to produce target metabolites. Finally, the effects of gene knockouts are predicted by measuring the difference of mini-mal active pathways between original networks and knockout ones. In the experiments, we applied it to predict the single gene knockout effects on the glycolysis pathway and <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> in Escherichia coli.

40|$|Recombinant protein {{production}} in Escherichia coli often derive cellular stress responses characterized by several biochemical reactions, {{most of which}} controlled at the genetic level. Drainage of precursors and energy often results in nutrient starvation, especially <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> deprivation inducing the cellular stringent response. The production of a specific nucleotide, ppGpp, catalyzed by the enzyme RelA, is the primary signalling and initiating event in the stringent response, when an uncharged tRNA attaches to a ribosome. This nucleotide interacts with RNA polymerase to control its activity in a promoter-selective mechanism, which ultimately leads to the inhibition of synthesis of stable RNAs (rRNAs and tRNAs), which results in the decrease of ribosome concentration and, therefore comprising the overall protein synthesis machinery. Moreover, this stress response also leads to the activation of synthesis of specific mRNAs coding for proteins involved in proteolysis and other stress factors. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the dynamics of the stringent response, a mathematical model was developed. Here we propose an hybrid modelling approach based on cooperation between kinetics-based dynamic model and FBA-based static model.
