40|$|Is {{the onset}} of {{fertility}} decline caused by structural socioeconomic changes, as affirmed by demand theory, or by the transmission of new ideas, as argued <b>by</b> <b>ideation</b> theory? The marital fertility decline in Iran before the Islamic Revolution provides an ideal, quasiexperimental, setting for addressing this question.

40|$|This study {{examines}} aspects of prediction of suicide {{and death of}} undetermined intent. We investigated all consecutive, autopsied patients between 1993 and 1997 {{who had been in}} contact with the Addiction Centre in Malmö from 1968 onwards. The staff was asked, shortly after autopsy but before they knew of the manner of death, if they thought the patient had committed suicide. The case records were blindly evaluated, and toxicological autopsy findings for alcohol in blood samples investigated. The specificity of prediction was 83 % and significantly more often correct than the sensitivity, which was only 45 % for suicide and for suicide/death of undetermined intent (93 % versus 39 %). Suicidal communication was more often considered non-serious before death of undetermined intent than before suicide.

Early and valid detection of <b>apraxia</b> <b>by</b> a bedside test may be relevant for functional outcome in stroke patients. The present study aimed to develop in 2 phases a new screening test for apraxia, called the Apraxia Screen of TULIA (AST), based on the comprehensive standardized test for upper limb apraxia (TULIA). In Phase I an item reduction analysis of the TULIA (48 gestures) following the methods of classical test theory was performed based on a large population of stroke patients (n = 133) and healthy subjects (n = 50). Furthermore, the 6 -point scoring method of TULIA was dichotomized to the score levels pass and fail. In Phase II validity of the resulting new scale AST was prospectively assessed in a new cohort of stroke patients (n = 31) by using Pearson’s correlation analysis and binary classification display (apraxia yes, apraxia no) with the TULIA. Stepwise removal of items resulted in the final scale of 12 gestures still demonstrating high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 92). Validation of the 12 -item AST with the TULIA showed a remarkable diagnostic accuracy with high specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value, both {{for the presence of}} apraxia and its severity.

40|$|According to {{prescriptive}} decision theories, {{the generation}} of options for choice is a central aspect of decision making. A too narrow representation of the problem may indeed limit the opportunity to evaluate promising options. However, despite the theoretical and applied significance of this topic, the cognitive processes underlying option generation are still unclear. In particular, while a cued recall account of option generation emphasizes the role of memory and executive control, other theoretical proposals {{stress the importance of}} ideation processes based on various search and thinking processes. Unfortunately, relevant behavioral evidence on the cognitive processes underlying option generation is scattered and inconclusive. In order to reach a better understanding, we carried out an individual-differences study employing a wide array of cognitive predictors, including measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, cognitive control, and ideation fluency. The criterion tasks consisted of three different poorly-structured decision-making scenarios, and {{the participants were asked to}} generate options to solve these problems. The main criterion variable of the study was the number of valid options generated, but also the diversity and the quality of generated options were examined. The results showed that option generation fluency and diversity in the context of ill-structured decision making are supported <b>by</b> <b>ideation</b> ability even after taking into account the effects of individual differences in several other aspects of cognitive functioning. Thus, ideation processes, possibly supported by search and thinking processes, seem to contribute to option generation beyond basic associative memory retrieval. The findings of the study also indicate that generating more options may have multifaceted consequences for choice, increasing the quality of the best option generated but decreasing the mean quality of the options in the generated set...|$|R

APPROACH In order to establish the potential reasons behind the unexpectedly poor {{performance of}} Australian students this study reflected on: (1) the results of OECD PISA 2012 assessment of student skills in mathematics, science and reading {{and the results of}} the 2012 OECD PISA assessment of creative problem solving skills; (2) performance of students from Australia, Czech Republic, Finland and Russian Federation in the abovementioned idea generation experiment; (3) reviews of educational systems of Australia, Czech Republic, Finland and Russian Federation as well as the admission requirements at universities that participated in the abovementioned idea generation experiment. RESULTS It was discovered that the minimum university admission requirements in science knowledge at participating universities from Czech Republic, Finland and Russian Federation were similar and substantially more demanding than that at the Australian university. All other identified factors that could have influenced the idea generation performance were evaluated and found to be insignificant.

40|$|Aim: Praxis {{assessment}} {{in children with}} developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is usually based on tests of adult <b>apraxia,</b> <b>by</b> comparing across types of gestures and input modalities. However, the cognitive models of adult praxis processing are rarely used in a comprehensive and critical interpretation. These models generally involve two systems: a conceptual system and a production system. Heterogeneity of deficits is consistently reported in DCD, involving other cognitive skills such as executive or visual-perceptual and visuospatial functions. Surprisingly, few researches examined {{the impact of these}} functions in gestural production. Our study aimed at discussing the nature and specificity of the gestural deficit in DCD using a multiple case study approach. Method: Tasks were selected and adapted from protocols proposed in adult apraxia, in order to enable a comprehensive assessment of gestures. This included conceptual tasks (knowledge about tool functions and actions; recognition of gestures), representational (transitive, intransitive), and non-representational gestures (imitation of meaningless postures). We realized an additional assessment of constructional abilities and other cognitive domains (executive functions, visual-perceptual and visuospatial functions). Data from 27 patients diagnosed with DCD were collected. Neuropsychological profiles were classified using an inferential clinical analysis based on the modified t-test, by comparison with 100 typically developing children divided into five age groups (from 7 to 13 years old). Results: Among the 27 DCD patients, we first classified profiles that are characterized by impairment in tasks assessing perceptual visual or visuospatial skills (n = 8). Patients with a weakness in executive functions (n = 6) were then identified, followed by those with an impaired performance in conceptual knowledge tasks (n = 4). Among the nine remaining patients, six could be classified as having a visual spatial/visual constructional dyspraxia. Gestural production deficits were variable between and within profiles. Discussion: This study confirmed the heterogeneity of gestural production deficit among children with a diagnosis of DCD, at both intra- and inter-individual levels. The contribution of other cognitive deficits in most of the profiles allows discussing the specificity of gestural difficulties. This argues in favor of the necessity to distinguish gestural problems with other deficits made apparent through gesture...|$|R

Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess suicidal ideation in school going tribal and nontribal adolescents and to study its relationships with psychological well-being, depression, and anxiety. Materials and Methods: A total of 259 students of Classes X, XI, and XII of three Schools of Ranchi, who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria, were screened for suicidal <b>ideation</b> <b>by</b> Suicidal <b>Ideation</b> Questionnaire (SIQ) and psychological well-being by General Health Questionnaire- 12 (GHQ- 12). The level of anxiety and depression was assessed by Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Overall 33. 2 % of the adolescents had suicidal ideation out of which 34. 2 % were tribal-students and 32. 8 % nontribal-students with no significant intergroup difference. Psychological discomfort (GHQ- 12 Score ≥ 3) was noticed in 59. 1 % of adolescents, but no racial difference was found. However, the mean HADS depression score was significantly higher in tribal adolescents, more so in tribal boys than nontribal adolescents or boys, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation of SIQ total score in all the adolescents with GHQ- 12 total score, HADS total score, HADS anxiety score, and HADS depression score.
