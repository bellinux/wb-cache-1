5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the lesion.

40|$|Lymphatic {{metastasis}} is {{the main}} metastatic route for lung cancer, and {{is also one of}} the most important prognostic factors. Therefore, lymph node dissection has been an important procedure in standard lung cancer surgery. But so far, the mode <b>and</b> the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> lymph node dissection during surgery are controversial for lung cancer in different pathological types, stages, or in different lobes.

5|$|Later {{analysis}} of naval support during the pre-landing phase {{concluded that the}} navy had provided inadequate bombardment, given the size <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the planned assault. Kenneth P.

5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} the exact cause <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the {{massacre}} in Maribor. All agree that on 27 January 1919, the Coolidge Mission's delegation, led by Sherman Miles, visited Maribor and found thousands of citizens of German ethnic origin gathered in the main city square and waving flags of German Austria, many of which also decorated nearby buildings. German Austrian sources indicate that there were 10,000 protesters singing songs and wearing patriotic dress. Twenty soldiers under Maister's command were stationed {{in front of the}} city hall, armed with rifles mounted with bayonets.|$|E

5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|The Alamanni, {{who were}} {{originally}} from the Main valley of central Germany, had colonised the Agri Decumates (roughly {{the modern state}} of Baden-Württemberg in SW Germany) when the region was evacuated by the Romans in the mid-3rd century after belonging to the Roman province of Germania Superior for over 150 years. The Alamanni established {{a series of small}} pagi ("cantons"), mostly strung along the East bank of the Rhine (although a few were in the hinterland). The exact number <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> these pagi is unclear and probably changed over time. Pagi, usually pairs of pagi combined, formed kingdoms (regna) which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary.|$|E
5|$|The Liao dynasty was {{destroyed}} by the Jurchen people of the Jin dynasty in 1125 with the capture of Emperor Tianzuo of Liao. However, the remnant Khitan, led by Yelü Dashi, established the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty), which ruled over parts of Central Asia for almost a century before being conquered by the Mongols. Although cultural achievements associated with the Liao dynasty are considerable, {{and a number of}} various statuary and other artifacts exist in museums and other collections, major questions remain over the exact nature <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the influence of the Liao Khitan culture upon subsequent developments, such as the musical and theatrical arts.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the microbial degradation of 14 C-labelled hexadecane, octacosane, phenanthrene and pyrene and considered how degradation might be optimised in three genuinely hydrocarbon contaminated soils from former petroleum refinery sites. Hydrocarbon mineralisation by the indigenous microbial community was monitored over 23 d. Hydrocarbon mineralisation enhancement by nutrient amendment (biostimulation), hydrocarbon degrader addition (bioaugmentation) and combined nutrient and degrader amendment, was also explored. The ability of indigenous soil microflora to mineralise 14 C-target hydrocarbons was appreciable; ≥ 16 % mineralised in all soils. Generally, addition of nutrients or degraders increased the rates <b>and</b> <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> mineralisation of 14 C-hydrocarbons. However, the addition of nutrients and degraders in combination had a negative effect upon 14 C-octacosane mineralisation and resulted in lower <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> mineralisation in the three soils. In general, the rates <b>and</b> <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> mineralisation will be dependent upon treatment type, nature of the contamination and adaptation of the ingenious microbial communi...|$|R

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, the type <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> surgery necessary varies based on patient age, {{severity of the}} lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a growing public {{awareness}} in the U.S. of military activities in Laos. During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. The testimony of subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos. Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, the nature <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> that commitment was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E
5|$|During the 1790s, {{politicians}} and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales {{in an area}} that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, and the Georgia legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in a number of cases, land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission to resolve conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation to resolve the issue. Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia's claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved to resolve other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on the nature <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the fraud, activities in which Lincoln was heavily involved.|$|E

5|$|East Lansing is {{very much}} a college town, with 60.2% of the {{population}} between the ages of 15 and 24. President John A. Hannah's push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States. Around 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the Residence Halls Association. Yet despite the size <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a co-op.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe weather event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in the timing <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the tornado outbreak still existed. These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} Ghazis fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's {{official}} historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed {{the position of}} the rudder <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the damage suffered. The first was that Ghazi had come up to periscope depth to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to crash dive, which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: {{on the night of the}} explosion, Rajput was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two depth charges on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage. The third possibility is that there was a mishap when Ghazi was laying mines on the day before hostilities broke out.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{variation}} in the rate <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> recovery. The prognosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea before the onset of disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve conduction study, the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is treated differently.|$|E
5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking his accent. Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge <b>and</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E
