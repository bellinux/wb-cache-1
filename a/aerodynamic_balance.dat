500|$|McLaren {{deliberately}} introduced two brand-new engines {{for both}} Alonso and Button at the , effectively moving {{them to the}} back of the grid, but allowing them to contest the Italian and Singapore Grands Prix—deemed to be crucial races in assessing the engine's development—without the risk of a penalty. Despite this plan, the team were forced to take another penalty in Italy when further engine changes were needed, bringing their total use up to nine engines from the original allocation of four. Belgium also saw the team's second major aerodynamic update: the team added extra fins to the front of the floor to improve air flow under the car, lowered the height of the sidepods and revised the engine cover. The position of the radiator used to cool the energy recovery system was also changed. Both cars completed the Belgian Grand Prix, but once again finished outside the points, one lap down in thirteenth and fourteenth place. Button described the result as [...] "embarrassing" [...] after both cars were classified as finishing behind Sebastian Vettel despite Vettel retiring from the race on the final lap. The team reverted to the longer-specification snub nose for the Italian Grand Prix in order to provide better <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and lower drag on the high-speed Autodromo Nazionale Monza circuit. The change proved to be of little benefit, as both drivers were eliminated in the first qualifying period and struggled throughout the race. Button finished in fourteenth, while Alonso retired with an electrical problem but was classified in eighteenth position as he had completed 90% of race winner Lewis Hamilton's race distance. The race marked a milestone of fifty races since McLaren's last Grand Prix win at the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} changes were made to {{aircraft}} before Pe-3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat-use revealed several additional problems {{that had to be}} addressed in a second Pe-3bis prototype, which began its State acceptance tests in May 1942. Reloading the nose guns proved to be time-consuming, taking up to 45minutes, and the night-firing of the port-side UBK continued to blind the pilot. These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition. The starboard gun was given 230rounds and the port gun had 265rounds. This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7fuel tank by , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns. The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected, making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable. These were reinforced with steel sheets to minimize the damage inflicted by the large-caliber cases. The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire, but lack of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance</b> prevented the gunner/navigator to use its full range. Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40–50° from the centerline. A twin-petal compensator proved mostly ineffective. The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space. The ammunition box of the UBT was too small, only 30rounds, and took about a minute to reload. The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200-round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems. An anti-icing system was added for the propellers and the pilot's windscreen. The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew's armor was increased to a total weight of [...] These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened, moving the wheels [...] forward, which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over.|$|E

50|$|The C.V was a {{conventional}} two-bay biplane design of its day, with unstaggered wings of equal span and tandem, open cockpits {{for the pilot}} and observer. The ailerons, fitted only to the upper wing, featured <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balances</b> that extended past the wingtips. The fuselage was a semi-monocoque construction skinned in wood.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was furnished with an elliptical wing, the internal structure of which comprised a multi-cell configuration using {{a total of}} five spars, stress-skin covering, and integral fuel tanks within the center section. The wing made use of a modified N.38 airfoil section and was outfitted with Frise-type ailerons complete with static and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance,</b> along with a split-continuous flap. The cockpit of the Re.2000 featured a large backwards-sliding canopy; it is claimed that this canopy provided [...] "almost unrestricted all-round visability".|$|E
2500|$|The all-wood Handasyde was a high-wing {{semi-cantilever}} monoplane, with parallel-chord wings {{that had}} slightly tapered tips. [...] The wings were built up around two spars {{and covered with}} 1mm plywood from the rear spar at mid-chord forward; on each side a lift strut linked the wing at about 1/3 span to the fuselage lower longeron. [...] The wing was then fabric covered, with a wire-supported scalloped trailing edge. It carried narrow ailerons outboard. [...] The fuselage was rectangular in cross section, tapering more in elevation than in plan. [...] There were no fixed stabilisers at the rear, only an all moving rudder and undivided elevator. [...] Both these surfaces were hinged to provide <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance.</b> [...] The single cockpit was over the wing and towards the trailing edge, with some instruments built into the wing surface. Ahead of the wing the fuselage was short, with the air-cooled 750 cc Douglas flat-twin driving a two-bladed propeller. [...] The diminutive undercarriage had thin and small diameter wheels (12 in or 305mm) on a single axle mounted on short vertical extensions from the lower longerons.|$|E
2500|$|The Handcross [...] was {{constructed}} from wood and fabric throughout. It was a three-bay biplane with equal-span wings without stagger or sweep. [...] The wings had parallel chord but the lower planes were significantly narrower than the upper; only the lower planes carried dihedral. [...] Ailerons, with back-set hinges to provide <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance,</b> were {{mounted on the}} upper planes alone. The wide-track divided main undercarriage had legs mounted on the wing front spar below the innermost interplane struts, braced to the fuselage. [...] The fuselage was flat-sided with a pronounced dorsal fairing or decking and a similar ventral fairing below. [...] The pilot sat in an open cockpit below the upper wing, with the gunner in a dorsal position behind him. [...] The gunner could also access two spaces in the belly: a prone position below the pilot for bomb aiming, or a rearward-firing gun position behind this. [...] The tail surfaces were conventional, rudder and elevators being horn-balanced; the rudder reached down below the fuselage bottom, protected by a small tailskid. [...] The V-12 watercooled Condor engine was cooled by a radiator in the nose below the boss of the two bladed metal Leitner-Watts propeller.|$|E

50|$|Its {{fuselage}} was wood framed, flat sided and plywood skinned. Its cockpit, {{open but}} with a small windscreen, was immediately ahead of the wing leading edge; there were no instruments. The Balilla's tail surfaces were all straight edged: the tailplane, single strut braced from below, had a sharply swept leading edge and carried elevators with angled tips and a cut-out for rudder movement. The vertical tail was tapered with a squared tip; the rudder reached to the keel, where it was protected by a wire loop tail bumper. Elevators and the rudder lacked <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balances.</b> A conventional skid, running from the nose to below the wing trailing edge formed the undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} had an hexagonal cross-section with deep, almost upright sides, {{its upper}} surfaces curving {{down over the}} nose. It was entirely plywood covered.

A wooden skid with a rubber shock absorbers ran along the underside to form an undercarriage, assisted by a small, faired tail skid. Under the trailing edge the fuselage dropped down from the pedestal then tapered to the rear. The tail surfaces were all straight tapered and square tipped, with almost all of the surfaces moving. Enough fixed fin and tailplane was retained to allow <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> via an inset hinge.|$|R

5000|$|The Potez XVIII airliner, {{displayed}} at the 1922 Paris Salon, was a development of the Potez X colonial transport. It was an unequal span biplane largely built of wood, though with metal engines mountings and other fittings, engine nacelles and tail surfaces. The rectangular plan wings were fabric covered. On each side, towards the wing tips a parallel pair of interplane struts leaned outwards. Closer to the fuselage a parallel pair of V-form interplane struts formed a cradle for the outboard engines, mounted between the wings. These, and the third in the nose, were Lorraine 8Bds, water-cooled V-8 engines, each producing cooled by cylindrical radiators hung beneath each engine nacelle. Ailerons with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balances</b> extending past the wing-tips were fitted on the lower wing only.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the D.XII was, {{like the}} D.XI, a single bay {{sesquiplane}} but its wings were different in plan and construction. The upper wing was straight edged with some sweep {{on the leading}} edge, it had a thinner aerofoil section than that of its predecessor and was fabric rather than plywood covered. Overhung ailerons were used, their ends projecting outboard of the squared wing tips proper, acting as <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balances.</b> The lower wing, which lacked ailerons, was both much shorter in span and smaller in chord. The early D.XII had a V-form interplane strut on each side; another strut leant out from each wing root to the upper rear spar, assisted ahead of it on each side by a short V-form pair linking the two spars to the upper fuselage longeron, acting as N-form cabane struts.|$|R
5000|$|The Avionette was {{powered by}} an air-cooled, , four-cylinder, upright inline Sergant A engine, which was geared down to produce [...] at 3,200 rpm. [...] It was {{enclosed}} in a duralumin cowling. Behind the engine the fuselage had a rectangular section, formed by four longerons connected with frames, and was plywood covered. [...] Its open cockpit {{was over the}} wing at mid-chord; a photo shows a streamlined headrest. At the rear the fin was triangular and {{an integral part of}} the fuselage. It carried a roughly trapezoidal rudder working in a cut-out in the one-piece elevator, which was similar in plan to the wing and hinged behind its leading edge to provide <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balancing.</b> The control surfaces were deliberately large, to allow the Avionette to be flown as a glider.|$|R

5000|$|When first used, {{overtaking}} was frequent as cars {{could follow}} closely {{through the last}} two corners and slipstream down the long straight.

5000|$|Little {{information}} on the specifications of the Saeqeh has been released. The Commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, Brigadier-General Ahmad Mighani, said that the Saeqeh is up-to-date in terms of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and in possessing missile and radar systems. The Managing Director of the Aviation Organization of the Ministry of Defense and Logistics of the Armed Forces, Majid Hedayat, described the Saeqeh as a logistic and combat plane with high manoeuvring capability {{and an ability to}} bomb close targets.

50|$|The sole J 15 was {{complete}} by {{the autumn of}} 1920, but {{was moved to the}} Netherlands for its first flight in early 1921 to avoid the restrictions on German aircraft production imposed by the Allies after their victory in World War I. After flying as a low-wing monoplane the wing was moved to the high position and the low fuselage wing roots skinned over with corrugated Duralumin, leaving the profile visible. The high wing configuration was judged superior and adopted for the larger and heavier J 16 production two passenger machine. The J 16 was also influenced by the J 15 trials in having a cockpit immediately ahead of the wings, as the take off view from the mid fuselage cockpit of the latter was poor with high set wings, and by the addition of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balances</b> to elevators and rudder.|$|R
2500|$|The {{hull of the}} Latécoère 340 had a {{planing bottom}} with two steps. [...] It was built around a keel and four {{longerons}} and provided a mooring position in the nose, an enclosed cabin for pilot and radio operator and a passenger cabin with four windows on each side. Aft of the cabin there was a space for mail. The sponsons, symmetric [...] in cross section and with a thickness/chord ratio of 12.5%, were entirely metal. [...] The fuselage was aluminium covered, tapering towards the tail with decreasing skin thickness. [...] Like the wings, the rear surfaces were metal structures with fabric covering. The tailplane was mounted a little way up the fin, the latter carrying a generous and rounded rudder, its lower edge blending elegantly into {{the lines of the}} lower fuselage. [...] The rudder had a trim tab, but neither it nor the elevators had <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balances.</b>|$|R
500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the manufacturer's trials in April 1947, one aircraft was returned to the factory for extensive modifications as the 150M. The wing tips were angled downward 35° to reduce the lateral stability, the wing was redesigned to detach from the fuselage, and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> of the elevators was reduced from 24% to 20%. The fuel capacity was increased to , the cockpit was widened by [...] and fitted with an ejection seat. Fore and aft armor plates were fitted to protect the pilot and a new radio aerial mast was installed.

50|$|The fin flash {{evolved from}} the rudder stripes painted on the rudders of early RFC and RAF {{aircraft}} during the First World War, the markings comprising blue, white and red vertical stripes doped on the rudder. However, {{with the performance of}} aircraft increasing considerably during the 1930s, the practice of applying painted markings onto the (then manually powered) control surfaces was discontinued because of the need to rebalance the controls - failure to do this could have adverse effects on the surface's <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance,</b> possibly leading to flutter of the control surface at high airspeeds. It was for this same reason that the positioning of the wing roundels was revised so that they no longer overlapped the ailerons.|$|E
50|$|The much revised Rs.II {{had four}} more {{reliable}} Maybach Mb.IVa engines fitted in push pull nacelles mounted on struts above the hull at approx. mid gap. Initially the biplane tail cellule was retained with large fins and rudders {{attached to the}} tail boom side members; the tail unit was later made more conventional with a large tailplane and twin fins with rudders. Take-off performance was improved by moving the step further aft but the take-off run was still excessive. The upper wing was also lowered by shortening the centre section struts and moving the mounts for the side struts to halfway {{down the sides of}} the fuselage. Other changes included <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance</b> surfaces for the ailerons, lower wings with reduced chord and rounded tips.|$|E
50|$|The Ar 77 had a thick {{cantilevered}} wooden wing, {{which was}} skinned with plywood on the undersurfaces {{and covered with}} fabric on the upper surfaces. The fuselage was built up from welded steel tubing covered with fabric. Tail surfaces were built up from steel tubing and were also fabric-covered, not following Arado's trademark layout of a fin and rudder forward of the tailplane. Instead the tailplane was high-mounted on the fin and supported by steel tube 'N' struts. Elevators and rudder were covered with fabric, aerodynamically balanced in the Ar 77A and without <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balance</b> horns in the Ar 77B. The fixed tailwheel undercarriage consisted of cantilevered oleo-pneumatic main leg struts fitted with brakes and a tailwheel under the rear fuselage. The four crew members, being pilot, navigator or instructor, and two students, were accommodated in a cabin with full-length windows along the fuselage sides.|$|E
50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the manufacturer's trials in April 1947, one aircraft was returned to the factory for extensive modifications as the 150M. The wing tips were angled downward 35° to reduce the lateral stability, the wing was redesigned to detach from the fuselage, and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> of the elevators was reduced from 24% to 20%. The fuel capacity was increased to 660 kg, the cockpit was widened by 80 cm and fitted with an ejection seat. Fore and aft armor plates were fitted to protect the pilot and a new radio aerial mast was installed. All these changes added 365 kg of weight and increased drag which reduced the aircraft's top speed by 73 to 805 km/h, and slowed its time to 5000 m from 4.8 to 7.2 minutes in comparison to the unmodified aircraft. Given that a higher-performance design, the Aircraft 156, had already been submitted for state acceptance trials, Semyon Lavochkin decided not to continue the development of the 150M.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Balestruccio was hexagonal, with deep, near vertical sides. [...] Its comfortable cockpit {{was immediately}} {{in front of}} the wing leading edge and was originally provided with a wooden canopy with small side openings, similar to that used on the German DFS Fafnir, but this was later replaced with a more conventional open arrangement which provided better all-round visibility. A single, sprung skid and a tail bumper provided an undercarriage. The fuselage tapered aft to a mid mounted horizontal tail consisting almost entirely of the elevator; although this had straight leading edges, a combination of their slight sweep and the full, rounded trailing edges gave the planform an almost elliptical appearance. There were <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>balances</b> and a large cut-out for rudder movement. As first constructed, the vertical tail was rather similar, with a small fin and a full, deep, curved, balanced rudder which extended slightly below the keel. Later, with the fuselage shortened by one frame or about 700 mm, the Balestruccio was given a new, angular fin and rudder with straight taper and square tip. Like the old rudder, this was also balanced and deep, though extending only to the keel. The original horizontal tail was retained.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} is noticeably shallow, {{with a long}} cabin glazed {{ahead and}} behind the wing, both above and to the sides. A [...] Rotax 912 ULS flat four engine in the nose drives a three-blade propeller. The rectangular tailplane is set well back; the ViS-3 had mass balanced elevators, developed on the ViS-5 to include <b>aerodynamic</b> (horn) <b>balances</b> and slightly increased in span. There is a tall fin and rudder, also straight-edged but swept; the rudder has a prominent trim tab. A fixed tricycle undercarriage has spring cantilever main legs and cantilever-mounted, castoring nosewheel.|$|R
