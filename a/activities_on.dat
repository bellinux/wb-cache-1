He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E

In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E

Approval of the act, which was amended in 1980 and 1992, represented the first time the United States had a broad-based historic preservation policy.

40|$|Background: Poor {{health costs}} the Swedish society billions {{a year and}} affects every {{individual}} who lives with poor health. By a close collaboration between medical doctors, nurses and other health professions there are good opportunities to work with health promotion and for the individual patient’s health.   One way to work with health promotion in health care {{is to work with}} Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral, FaR®.  Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral was created to improve the health among the Swedish population and has been effective against diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Research has been done on which professional groups that makes the most prescriptions of Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral and why patients don’t follow them. Objective: The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the frequency of and the attitude toward prescribing Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral, among medical doctors and medical students and to investigate if there were any differences between genders. Method: A web survey was designed and sent to 45 medical doctors at Akademiska Sjukhuset in Uppsala and to 286 medical students in semester 7 - 9 at Uppsala University. Results: The majority of the participants thought that physical activity had an important role in health promotion and knew about Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral. Even though few of the participants had made a prescription of Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral, the majority thought that it was an important part in the work with health promotion. The participants thought that more education in Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral was needed. The participants prioritized to prescribe Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral to patients at risk to get cardiovascular diseases, while patients who were less physical active than the recommendations of Livsmedelsverket got the lowest priority. Conclusion: Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral was created to increase physical activity among the Swedish population and to reduce the risk to get diseases that can be related to low physical activity. It is therefore alarming that the participants were less prioritizing patients who were less physical active than the recommendations of Livsmedelsverket when it comes to prescribing Physical <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> referral, than other patients. By medical doctors and nurses working as a team, preventive actions can be taken early and therefore the risk for the individuals to develop secondary diseases can be reduced. ...|$|R

Indoor and outdoor leisure and recreational facilities are provided by some farmers including paint-balling, laser-combat games, pony trekking, mountain biking and many other activities.
