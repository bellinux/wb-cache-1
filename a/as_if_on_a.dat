5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires {{the knowledge of the}} telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} by George Kamitani as first a sequel {{and then a}} spiritual successor to the 1997 Sega Saturn title Princess Crown. Development began in 2004 after the official formation of Vanillaware. The story was based around {{the concept of a}} Valkyrie princess. The scenario and world design incorporated Norse mythology, the works of William Shakespeare, fairy tales and early video games. 2D graphics were chosen over 3D graphics as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating, which necessitated presenting cutscenes <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stage rather than using traditional cinematography. Leifthrasir began development in 2013 as a means of addressing the issues both players and staff had with the original game while keeping the story intact. The music for both versions was composed by a team from Basiscape, led by company founder Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E

25|$|The Jack Cade {{episode was}} dramatised in William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 2 (Act 4, Scene 6), first {{performed}} in 1591 or 1592. In Shakespeare's elaborated {{version of the}} event, Cade strikes London Stone with a staff rather than a sword, then seats himself upon the Stone <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> throne, to issue decrees and dispense rough justice to a follower who displeases him.|$|E
25|$|In that spirit, Nearing {{moved through}} a series of secessions—from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the {{wilderness}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing's perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{there were}} only open living areas {{at the back of}} the {{farmhouse}} on both sides of the fireplace. Here there were tables, chairs and wall beds and, of course, open contact with the animals. Not until after the Thirty Years War when the demand for living comfort grew, were separate rooms built {{at the back of the}} farmhouse, each the length of a bay (ca. 2.5 m) i.e. the space between the interior posts. This living space was called a Kammerfach from Kammer (room or chamber) and Fach (bay). One subsequent change was the addition of a cellar under the Kammerfach, but it was not very deep. The separate living quarters were raised above the level of the main hall <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plinth and in the larger four-post farmhouses (Vierständerhäuser) sometimes formed a sort of gallery.|$|E

50|$|The {{economic}} distress of the Great Depression {{was accompanied}} {{by the rise of}} the farm system — pioneered by the St. Louis Cardinals' Branch Rickey. The Cardinals purchased minor league teams at all levels to develop their talent <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> assembly line, and when they needed a second top-level farm club (St. Louis already owned the Rochester Red Wings of the International League), they purchased the struggling Senators club and dubbed it the Red Birds, a popular nickname for the big-league club.|$|R

500|$|Doggystyle was {{generally}} praised by critics. Rolling Stone writer Touré mentioned [...] "Doggystyle {{is filled with}} verbal and vocal feats that meet its high expectations. It speeds through 55minutes of constant talk <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> suicide hot line". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly noted [...] "It is the most limber, low-rider gangsta album to date" [...] {{and went on to}} say [...] "Doggystyle is a grim, bleak-faced record. It's set in a dead-end, no-tomorrow world of cheap thrills". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated [...] "Doggystyle and The Chronic stand proudly together as the twin pinnacles of West Coast G-funk hip-hop of the early '90s" [...] Stylus magazine presented [...] "The Chronic vs. Doggystyle" [...] article, and stated a strong point of Doggystyle compared to Dre's album was its follow-up singles and that [...] "some of the album tracks are more famous than the singles". Vibe magazine expressed that [...] "Snoop is no ordinary gangsta; that's impossible for an artist this playful. On his debut, with Dre riding shotgun anthems abound as often as gin-soaked debauchery". The Source magazine gave the album a 4/5 mic rating. It said Snoop Doggy Dogg emerged as a rapper who lived up to all the advance hype which came from his work on The Chronic, and discussed songs on the record, stating [...] "If 'Murder Was The Case' is a stroke of near genius, then 'Lodi Dodi' is an example of total genius." [...] NME magazine called the lead single [...] "a pinnacle he conquered effortlessly" [...] and went on to name the record a [...] "benchmark album".|$|E

25|$|Innovation in milking {{focused on}} mechanizing the milking parlor (known in Australia and New Zealand as a milking shed) to {{maximize}} the number of cows per operator which streamlined the milking process to permit cows to be milked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> assembly line, and to reduce physical stresses on the farmer by putting the cows <b>on</b> <b>a</b> platform slightly above the person milking the cows to eliminate having to constantly bend over. Many older and smaller farms still have tie-stall or stanchion barns, but worldwide a majority of commercial farms have parlors.|$|R
60|$|We {{became more}} and more insular even about our {{continental}} conquests; we stood upon our island <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> anchored ship. We never thought of Nelson at Naples, but only eternally at Trafalgar; and even that Spanish name we managed to pronounce wrong. But even if we regard the first attack upon Napoleon as a national necessity, the general trend remains true. It only changes the tale from a tragedy of choice to a tragedy of chance. And the tragedy was that, for a second time, we were at one with the Germans.|$|R

Although the orle's diminutive is the tressure, there are examples of [...] "fillet orles" [...] (orles narrower than usual). It is often said that an orle may not have other charges charged on it, but the Scots Public Register. When a number of charges are arranged <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bordure, they are said to be in orle or to form an orle of such charges.|$|E

5000|$|The Goodridge {{house had}} a hand-dug hideaway under the kitchen that was {{discovered}} during renovations in the 1900s. Goodridge {{is believed to}} have hidden freedom seekers there, and also in a hideaway under the stairs in Centre Hall, before transporting them East across the Susquehanna River to Columbia or on to Philadelphia. His Reliance Line rail cars may have had secret compartments that were used to transport people to freedom; the rail depot was just a short distance North of the house.

You have heard of whirlpools in water; well, this {{was just like a}} whirlpool of air. Even the Giant himself could hardly keep his legs against it; then he tossed Jaqueline up, and the airy whirlpool seized her and carried her, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tide of water, always round and round in narrowing circles, till she was sucked down into the hollow hill. Even as she went, she seemed to remember the hill, as if she had dreamed about it, and the shape and colour of the country. But presently she sank softly on to a couch, in a beautifully-lighted rocky hall. All around her the floor was of white and red marble, but on one side it seemed to end in black nothing.|$|E
