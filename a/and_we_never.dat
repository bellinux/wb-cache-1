He had a minor {{role as the}} Vampire Bass Player in Michael Rymer's film Queen of the Damned (February 2002). In 2007 he joined Chris Brokaw (ex-Codeine) and Chris Eckman to issue the album, Dirtmusic. In 2010 he formed Hugo Race Fatalists with Antonio Gramentieri and Diego Sapignoli from the Italian instrumental band, Sacri Cuori. They released two albums: Fatalists (Interbang/Gusstaff, 2010) <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Never</b> Had Control (Interbang/Gusstaff, 2012). In 2011 he returned to live in Australia. As from October 2013 Race was simultaneously a member of Hugo Race and the True Spirit, Hugo Race Fatalists, and Dirtmusic.|$|E

Kirk Wise and Russ Edmonds, Vinny's supervising animator, noted Novello's unique {{ability to}} improvise dialogue.

500|$|After {{the match}} City manager Joe Mercer said [...] "the heavy {{rain in the}} second half ruined the game" [...] and that he was [...] "quite happy with the {{performance}} of our team, although the technical level was rather low {{in the second half}}". Górnik manager Michał Matyas blamed his side's poor start, saying the [...] "first goal came too early for us <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> recovered from this shock." [...] The trophy was Manchester City's fourth major honour in three seasons. It made them the third English club to win the Cup Winners' Cup, after Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United.|$|E

500|$|By then, revolutionary {{examples}} also {{inspired the}} prisoners of Darnytsia to proclaim {{their own political}} goals, and openly demand the union of Transylvania with Romania. Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that {{once and for all}} that we [...] cannot carry on with our lives within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state. [...] For the sake of this ideal, we throw in the balance all of what we have, our lives and fortunes, our women and children, our descendants' life and happiness. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> will stop, lest we vanquish or perish." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out that}} the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just see how it works for the song.' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> second-guessed it. We were like, 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As a child, Gilberto {{lived in}} the city of Lagoa da Prata with his father (a blacksmith), his mother (a housewife) and three sisters. His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the {{district}} of Usina Luciânia. Despite financial hardship, causing his sisters and him to share a single room, he had a relatively carefree childhood: he describes it as [...] " [...] I had no responsibility in my life, I played football on the street with cousins and friends, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> had any contact with drugs or violence". In 1988 (aged 12), he got the chance to break out of poverty by playing football, joining América Mineiro as a youth player. It was during these years at América Mineiro that Gilberto was taught defensive discipline by playing as a central defender. When not playing football, Gilberto was taught furniture-making skills by his father, which he would come to use in the following years. In 1991, Gilberto's father retired leaving the 15-year-old to provide financially for his whole family, a task made more difficult by his mother's ill-health.|$|E

500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Brown's acrimonious {{departure}} from Cleveland was {{another source of}} criticism. His teams' winning ways had helped obscure his harsh methods and need for control, but Modell's active involvement in the team exposed them. Despite that Modell owned the team, Brown refused to cede any authority or be diplomatic in his relationship with Modell. Modell felt Brown was unwilling {{to adapt to the}} way football was played in the early 1960s. Many players from that time agreed. [...] "Paul didn't adjust to the changes in the game", former Browns cornerback Bernie Parrish said in 1997. [...] "By 1962, he was more worried about protecting his reputation as the Greatest Coach Who Ever Lived than he was about winning a title. ... By the end of the 1962 season, a lot of us wanted to be traded because we were convinced that we'd never win a title with Paul Brown – <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> believed Paul Brown was going anywhere." [...] After his firing, Brown held a grudge against Modell {{for the rest of his}} life. He never forgave Collier for taking over as coach when he left, even though Collier had asked for and received his blessing.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Arwadi in {{particular}} has expressed his belief in Christianity {{that is not a}} religion, but more about faith, as in his opinion most religions are about laws, organizations, rites, and dogmas. In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, {{does not have to be}} associated with religion whatsoever. When asked to clear up the [...] "confusion" [...] surrounding the band's stance regarding God, Christianity, and religions in general, Jeff responded that his views about religion are [...] "very different than the view in western countries," [...] and further said that [...] "in Indonesia, religion is not an issue of faith nor tradition. It's more the constitutional issue, that means the legal and political ones. I am not anti-religion person, but I do against religion in a political and legal context" [...] and then Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: [...] "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. We hate being trendy <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> try to be the same with the rest of the scene. People can love us or hate us, I don't care." ...|$|E

500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... {{is one of}} the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone’s in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they’re having a conversation, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting." [...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E

[...] Still, Dennis Cass of Slate magazine has criticized the duo for resorting to the same sensationalism as their targets, stating in a review of the series, [...] "One of the unwritten rules for winning an argument against an inflammatory, irrational opponent is to calmly adhere to a loftier set of rhetorical standards. Penn and Teller showily throw this notion into the trash." ...|$|E
