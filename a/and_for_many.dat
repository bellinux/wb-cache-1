5|$|Abd al-Rahman's son Sayyid al-Siddiq al-Mahdi was Imam of the Ansar for {{the next}} two years. After al-Siddiq's death in 1961 he was succeeded as imam by his brother Sayyid al-Hadi al-Mahdi, while al-Siddiq's son Sadiq al-Mahdi took over the {{leadership}} of the Umma party. Sadiq Al-Mahdi was arrested in 1970, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years alternated between spells in prison in Sudan and periods of exile. In 1985 Sadiq al-Mahdi was again elected president of the Umma party. In the 1986 elections he became Prime Minister of Sudan, holding office until the government was overthrown in 1989. After further imprisonment and exile, Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to Sudan in 2000 and in 2002 was elected Imam of the Ansar. In 2003 Sadiq Al-Mahdi was re-elected President of Umma.|$|E

5|$|After the Iberian king Pharasmanes I had his son Rhadamistus (r.51–55AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, Vologeses I of Parthia (r. c.51–77AD) {{planned to}} invade and place his brother, the later Tiridates I of Armenia, on the throne. Rhadamistus was {{eventually}} driven from power, and, {{beginning with the}} reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia—with brief interruptions—through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. Even {{after the fall of}} the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings. However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the Georgian kings with the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> centuries afterwards in Caucasian Albania through the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many,</b> the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E

5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. <b>And</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|Images of Sophiatown were {{initially}} {{built up in}} literature by a generation of South African writers: Can Themba, Bloke Modisane, Es'kia Mphahlele, Arthur Maimane, Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Casey Motsisi and Lewis Nkosi who all lived in Sophiatown at various stages during the 1950s. They all shared certain elements of a common experience: education at St Peter's School and Fort Hare University, living in Sophiatown, working for Drum magazine, exile, banning under the Suppression of Communism Act <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> the writing of an autobiography.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} well known <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years {{respected}} books about Wyatt Earp was the book I Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp.

It was completed in 1978 {{at a cost of}} $1.5 million as the final stage of the same plan that expanded Manual's campus and built Noe. Noe had been built without an auditorium in anticipation of a theater-oriented school being built on site. The YPAS building includes production facilities, a costume shop and an 886-seat proscenium-style theater. The YPAS building did not contain extensive classroom space, however, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years teachers conducted YPAS classes in hallways and on loading docks if other space wasn't available. Since 1993, YPAS has used an adjacent facility, built in 1899 and formerly home to Cochran Elementary, as an annex.|$|E
5|$|Though sound-on-film would {{eventually}} become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, {{which came to}} an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process {{to an audience of}} scientists in Berlin. Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later. Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate for big-league commercial purposes, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years the heads of the major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures.|$|E

5|$|A western rock lobster fishery {{developed}} {{on the island}} in the early 20th century. There are records of the island {{being used as a}} base for crayfishers as early as 1902, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years it was used as an anchorage by anglers. It was not until 1947, however, that a seasonally inhabited permanent camp was established there. According to former crayfisher Ron Bertelsen, the first camp was established by skippers George Barker and George Nelson and deckhand John Long, who relocated there when lobsters around Pigeon Island grew scarce. They camped {{at the southern end of}} North Island in a camp initially built from packing case timbers. A local carrier boat, the Betty Margaret, serviced the camp. From about 40 seasonal inhabitants in 1940, the population grew to about 130 by 2003. An airstrip was built in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Herring was {{president}} of the Boy Scouts' Association of Victoria for 23 years, and was later the first president of the Australian Boy Scouts' Association from 1959 to 1977. He was chairman of trustees of the Shrine of Remembrance from 1945 to 1978 (and remained a trustee until his death) and chairman of trustees of the Australian War Memorial from 1959 to 1974. He was made a fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1949, received an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1953, became an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple in 1963 and received an honorary LLD from Monash University in 1973. He was also active in the Anglican Church, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years was chancellor of the diocese of Melbourne, the highest church office that could be held by a layman.

5|$|In 1754, {{a stretch}} of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed {{passengers}} {{for the maintenance of}} the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of market gardening, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, {{the first step in the}} development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.|$|E
