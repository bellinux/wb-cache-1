40|$|An {{aluminium}} polisher developed severe {{lung fibrosis}} complicated by bronchial carcinoma. Although {{he was not}} submitted to the exposure risks usually described in <b>aluminium</b> <b>lung</b> (bauxite smelting, use of aluminium powders, aluminium welding), he worked in {{a high concentration of}} aluminium dust. This was demonstrated by mineralogical analyses which revealed large amounts of small metallic aluminium particles (0. 5 micron - 5 micron) in bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue and lymph nodes 5 {{years after the end of}} exposure. Aluminium polishing seems to be a potential cause of <b>aluminium</b> <b>lung.</b> Case ReportsJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{discrepancy}} in previous {{reports of the}} action of <b>aluminium</b> on the <b>lung</b> {{may be explained by}} differences between stamped and granular aluminium powders. A stamped powder of the variety causing pulmonary fibrosis showed a brisk reaction with water, but a granular powder was unreactive. This difference is primarily due to the granular particles being covered by inert aluminium oxide, the formation of which is partially prevented in the stamping process by stearine and mineral oil. The reactivity of the flake-like stamped particles is also dependent on their large surface area per unit volume...|$|R
40|$|The {{aqueous extract}} {{was found to}} be more {{effective}} on the surfactant system of lung against ova albumin and <b>aluminium</b> hydroxide induced <b>lung</b> damage in albino wistar rats. The rats were divided into 3 groups of four animals each, namely group I, II and III which served as control, toxic and post treatment groups respectively. Our results showed increased Lung Body-Weight Index (LBI) and decreased lung lipid content in the toxic group of animals. But the levels of lipid content and Lung Body-Weight Index were restored in post-treated group of animals, which might be due to the protective activity of “Pentapala- 04 ”...|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} techniques routinely {{used for}} the mineralogical analysis of small particles, ranging from light microscopy (LM) to electron microscopy (EM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), {{can be applied to}} evaluate the content of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in various inorganic particles. The evaluation of the concentration of asbestos bodies (AB's) in BAL samples allows in some cases to assess an asbestos exposure not revealed through a detailed occupational inquiry, and consequently can have important medico-legal implications. However it must be kept in mind that even a very positive BAL is an indicator of exposure, but can never be considered as a proof of disease. The interest of these studies is not limited to asbestos related pathologies, but they have also contributed to a better diagnosis and understanding of the pathogenesis of unusual pneumoconiosis like <b>aluminium</b> induced interstitial <b>lung</b> disease and dental technicians pneumoconiosis. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although quartz {{is known}} to induce {{inflammation}} in rat lungs, the mechanisms by which it does so are not yet fully understood. The importance of particle surface characteristics was investi-gated in vivo after intratracheal instillation of different preparations of quartz in rat lungs. Three days after instillation of 2 mg of DQ 12 quartz, or DQ 12 -coated with polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide or <b>aluminium</b> lactate (AL), <b>lungs</b> of female Wistar rats were lavaged in situ to deter-mine markers of inflammation. Control rats received saline or the coating substances alone. DQ 12 induced a marked inflammatory response, as indicated by {{a significant increase in}} the number of neutrophils and macrophages, as well as in the levels of β-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase. None of these inflammatory markers was increased for both coated quartz preparations, with the exception of neutrophil influx, which was increased after treatment with AL quartz. Our results indicate that surface characteristics are important in the onset of quartz-induced lung inflammation and, by implication, the development of persistent inflam-mation. This will be investigated in later follow-up time points of the same animal study...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium (Al) is silvery, light, {{malleable}} and ductile, and {{the most}} abundant metal in the earth’s crust. Al is used primarily for metallurgical purposes, especially to produce Al-based alloy castings and wrought Al. Al compounds are found in consumer products such as antacids, astringents, buffered aspirin, food additives and antiperspirants. Powdered Al metal is often used in explosives and fireworks. No human data were available on respiratory tract and eye irritation following acute/single exposure to Al or Al compounds. Despite the wide use of Al, {{the small number of}} reports on effects indicates that Al is not harmful to the skin. Occupational high-level inhalatory exposure to Al can cause lung disorders such as impaired lung function and pulmonary fibrosis. In the most relevant repeated animal inhalation study, rats and guinea pigs were exposed to 0. 25, 2. 5 or 25 mg/m 3 Al chlorohydrate for 6 months. All animals in the two higher dose groups had multifocal granulomatomous pneumonia and microgranulomas in the peribronchial lymph nodes. At the lowest dose, these effects were regarded as minimal. Thus, 0. 25 mg/m 3 (0. 061 mg Al/m 3) is probably close to the no-effect level. Some field studies suggest that Al induce subclinical neurotoxic effects, but no exposure-response relationships could be established and co-exposure to other compounds may have played a role. Al compounds are neurotoxic in orally exposed animals at high doses. There are no animal inhalation neurotoxicity studies. Available data indicate that Al is not mutagenic, but that especially the watersoluble sulphate may cause chromosomal damage. Human and experimental animal data do not allow firm conclusions on the potential carcinogenicity of Al or its compounds. Increased cancer mortality rates in workers in the Al production industry especially for lung and urinary bladder is generally considered to be caused by co-exposure to carcinogenic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. No studies were found on the effects of occupational exposure to Al or Al compounds on reproductive capacity, pregnancy outcome or postnatal development. In animals, there are studies in which Al compounds were administered in the diet or drinking water. Water-soluble Al compounds have induced postnatal development effects. No effects on prenatal development were reported. Overall, the data are insufficient to identify a critical effect level except for Al chlorohydrate for which minimal pulmonary effects were seen in an animal study at 0. 061 mg Al/m 3.
