5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. <b>A</b> <b>captive</b> great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious.

5|$|In 2004, <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} and two free-living tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) suffering neurological {{symptoms were}} shown to be hosting the rat nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis. They were the first non-mammalian hosts discovered for the organism. A species of feather mite, Psittophagus calyptorhynchi, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, the {{gestation}} period for Campbell's dwarf hamster is between 18 and 20 days, and the shortest {{gestation period}} recorded for <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> female was 13 days. The male hamster {{is likely to}} assist the female during birth. The male may pull the offspring from the birth canal, clean them, or collect food for the mother and offspring.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales in}} many areas may prey on {{cormorants}} and gulls. <b>A</b> <b>captive</b> killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Play {{behaviour}} in calves differs {{between the}} sexes; females run or chase {{each other while}} males play-fight. The former are sexually mature {{by the age of}} nine years while the latter become mature around 14–15 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age. Lin Wang, <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} never {{fared well}} in captivity. The oldest {{lived to be}} 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. No records are known of <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> rhino giving birth.

5|$|The longest living eastern {{green mamba}} was <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> {{specimen}} which lived for 18.8 years. Another captive specimen lived for 14 years. However, {{while it may}} be possible for wild specimens to live that long, they are thought to have shorter lifespans in general due to the threats of predation, habitat loss, disease, and other biological and environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.|$|E
5|$|American {{automakers}} {{had first}} countered imports {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle with compact cars including the Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant, although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese imports from Toyota and Datsun increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded by introducing the Ford Cortina from its European arm Ford of Europe as <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> import. American automakers would soon introduce their own subcompacts.|$|E

5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} many Christians {{performed}} daring feats to rescue captives from Seringapatnam {{and take them}} to places of safety. <b>A</b> <b>captive</b> named Domingo Pinto (brother of Salvador Pinto, who rose to high rank in the services of Tipu), was particularly proficient in this. He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those anxious to regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money. He fixed the rescue price per captive at 8 hoons (Rs. 32) for a male, and 4 hoons (Rs. 16) for a female.|$|E
5|$|Bosman and Kolben's {{descriptions}} went largely unnoticed until 1771, {{when the}} Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, {{as well as}} his personal experience with <b>a</b> <b>captive</b> specimen, as a basis for consistently differentiating the spotted hyena from the striped. The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828.|$|E
