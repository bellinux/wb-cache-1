5|$|Sympathetic towards Chabaneau's {{state of}} poverty, the {{director}} of a Jesuit college in Passy offered him a position as a mathematics professor, despite Chabaneau having only <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> arithmetic. In studying the material for the next day's lessons, Chabaneau taught himself algebra and geometry. His academic interest soon spread to physics, natural history, and chemistry. At the age of twenty, Chabaneau was convinced to join the newly established Real Seminario Patriotico at Vergara to teach French and physics by brothers Fausto and Juan José Elhuyar. The two brothers, who later made a name for themselves by isolating metallic tungsten, had been hired by the Count of Peñaflorida, who had sent them to France to find professors for the Vergara Seminary.|$|E
5|$|The content {{ranges from}} {{extremely}} difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered {{at school and}} often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that anyone with <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E

25|$|Identifying {{mushrooms}} requires <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> their macroscopic structure. Most are Basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, {{are produced}} on the gills {{and fall in}} a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting {{the shape of the}} gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is used to help classify mushrooms and can help to identify them. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.|$|E

25|$|Frequency {{analysis}} {{requires only}} <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II (WWII), both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers {{used by the}} Axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's SIS. Today, {{the hard work of}} letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010 and December 2010, {{soldiers}} of the 560th worked specifically with the Ugandan army {{to set up a}} military decision making process (MDMP) training event. The idea was to familiarize the Ugandans with U.S. Army Light Infantry MDMP at the tactical battalion level. Uganda’s military is highly interested in understanding how the American Army conducts the MDMP based on their operational lessons learned in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. The seminar assisted the process by establishing <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> roles and responsibilities of a light infantry battalion staff in the MDMP process, MDMP timelines and sequence of events, products or deliverables, and an understanding of how this product aids the field commander. This, in turn, set the foundation for a follow-on MDMP, which will familiarize the Ugandan army with the light infantry decision making process at the brigade level. Such training events also help the U.S. by enhancing awareness in the U.S. military of Ugandan infantry battalion practices, thereby improving interoperability. They also elicit lessons learned from the audience’s peacekeeping operations.|$|E
25|$|Despite the College's liberal {{acceptance}} of various {{religious and ethnic}} groups, {{during the period from}} 1785–1849 the life of the college was a continuous struggle for existence, owing to inadequate means and lack of financial support. The curriculum of the college during the beginning of the 19th century was mostly focused studying the Classics. As a result, the major prerequisite for admission into the College was familiarity with Greek and Latin and <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> mathematics. Because the school had no athletic program, student life during this period was mainly focused around literary groups such as the Philolexian Society, which was founded in 1802. The average graduating class of the university during {{the first decade of the}} 19th century was seventeen. The main building which housed the College was decayed and unsightly in appearance; however, the funds of the College were augmented somewhat by the growing importance of its investments in real-estate, although the true wealth of these acquisitions wouldn't come to light till later in the century. In 1810, following the advice of a committee put together by members of the school, the College greatly increased its admission standards; nonetheless, admission of qualified students increased, with 135 students matriculating in 1810.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, {{even though}} volcanoes pose {{significant}} threats to local communities and any sizable eruption would affect Canada's economy, {{the work of}} understanding the frequency and eruption characteristics at volcanoes in Canada is a slow process. This is because most of Canada's dormant and potentially active volcanoes are located in isolated jagged regions, very few scientists study Canadian volcanoes {{and the provision of}} money in the Canadian government is limited. Because of these issues, scientists studying Canada's volcanoes have <b>a</b> <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> Canada's volcanic heritage and how it might impact people in the future. Volcanologists are aware that certain areas in Canada have higher levels of volcanic activity than others and how eruptions in these areas might affect people and the environment they live in. When a volcano is showing evidence of volcanic activity, quick action will be required to better understand the process. The lowest possibility for an eruption in Canada per year is approximately 1/200; for a passive lava eruption the possibility is about 1/220, and for a major explosive eruption it is about 1/3333. Even though volcanoes {{do not seem to be}} part of the everyday reality of Canadians, recurrent earthquakes and the formation of large mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest indicate this part of Canada is still geologically active. The possibility of an eruption, even a large explosive one, cannot be ruled out. Quiet as they currently seem, volcanoes in Northern and Western Canada are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Along with volcanoes associated with recent earthquake activity, a scenario of an eruption at Mount Cayley in southwestern British Columbia illustrates how Western Canada is in danger to a volcanic eruption, which has not erupted for at least 310,000years. This impact is becoming even more likely as population in the Pacific Northwest increases and development spreads. The scenario is based on former eruptions in the north-south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and includes both explosive and passive eruptions. Its effect is mostly due to the attention of defenseless public services in canyons. However, the threat from volcanoes outside of Canada seems much greater than the threat from volcanoes within Canada because of the lack of monitoring data at Canadian volcanoes and the age of most volcanoes in Canada is poorly known. But for some, their minimal degree of erosion indicates they formed much less than 10,000years ago, including the Milbanke Sound Group on Price Island, Dufferin Island, Swindle Island, Lake Island, and Lady Douglas Island in the Milbanke Sound area of coastal British Columbia. However, it is known volcanoes in the U.S. states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California have been more active in historic times than those within Canada. Therefore, volcanoes in the United States are monitored with caution and attention by the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
