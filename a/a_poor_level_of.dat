40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{order to}} build a ceramic {{component}} by inkjet printing, the object must be fabricated through the interaction and solidification of drops, typically {{in the range of}} 10 − 100 pL. In order to achieve this goal, stable ceramic inks must be developed. These inks should satisfy specific rheological conditions that can be illustrated within a parameter space defined by the Reynolds and Weber numbers. Printed drops initially deform on impact with a surface by dynamic dissipative processes, but then spread to an equilibrium shape defined by capillarity. We can identify the processes by which these drops interact to form linear features during printing, but there is <b>a</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> understanding as to how 2 D and 3 D structures form. The stability of 2 D sheets of ink appears to be possible over a more limited range of process conditions that is seen with the formation of lines. In most cases, the ink solidifies through evaporation and {{there is a need to}} control the drying process to eliminate the: “coffee ring” defect. Despite these uncertainties, there have been a large number of reports on the successful use of inkjet printing for the manufacture of small ceramic components from a number of different ceramics. This technique offers good prospects as a future manufacturing technique. This review identifies potential areas for future research to improve our understanding of this manufacturing method...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} if infection of Vibrio harveyi with the V. harveyi myovirus-like (VHML) bacteriophage {{causes a change}} to the phenotypic profile of this species. Methods and Results: Using 46 biochemical and metabolic tests, phenotypic profiles for noninfected V. harveyi and VHML infected V. harveyi were developed. Comparison of the infected and bacteriophage-infected strains of V. harveyi 645, 20 and 45 {{were found to have}} different test results ford-gluconate utilization, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and sulfatase activity, respectively. Using probabilistic identification, VHML infected and noninfected strains were identified as V. harveyi and had similar Willcox probability scores though the modal likelihood scores were reduced for VHML infected strains. One VHML infected strain, 642 b, was misidentified as V. campbellii by phenotyping but not by PCR. It would appear that the phenotype of V. harveyi strains infected with VHML, are sufficiently altered that they occur at the margins of the known range of strain variation for V. harveyi. Conclusion: Infection of V. harveyi with VHML causes the phenotypic profile of the bacterium to change. This change reduces the modal likelihood score resulting in <b>a</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> assurance for <b>an</b> identification of V. harveyi, especially in the natural host, strain 642.

50|$|The {{government}} {{budget has}} generally kept within projections. The budget deficit {{at the end}} of August 2011 reached about 2% of GDP, and fiscal authorities seemed committed to keeping it under the projected target of 2.5% of GDP {{by the end of the}} year. In addition to 220 million euros (approx. $298 million) drawn from an IMF Precautionary Credit Line (PCL) in March, financing mostly came from domestic borrowing. However, by the end of the year a financing gap remained of about 50 million to 60 million euros (approx. $67 million to $81 million), which the government plans to cover by borrowing from international capital markets, supported by a policy-based guarantee by the World Bank. The central government's public debt remained low at 26% of GDP, but represents a gradual increase from previous years. Despite lowering the Central Bank bills rate, the Central Bank has not changed liquidity indicators for banks or the reserve requirement since 2009, curbing credit growth to 7.5% in the first three-quarters of 2011. Nikola Gruevski says the government will pay off its entire debt to the private sector by February 2013 in order to improve the economy's overall liquidity.Macedonia's external trade struggled in 2010 due to the slow recovery from the economic crisis of its main trading partners, particularly EU members. Starting from a very low base, export growth in the first 8 months of 2011 reached 41.7%, topping import growth of 36.8%. The trade deficit has widened to 18.3% of GDP, approaching the end-year target of 21.9% of GDP. At the same time, the current account balance deficit significantly improved and the end-year projection was revised upward to 5.5% of GDP.

The authors used the Tetrafigap survey on the long-term outcome of Tetraplegic Spinal-cord-injured (TSCI) persons, in France, to study the sense of belonging to the community of disabled persons among 1356 TSCI persons in relation to factors of social participation (both sociological and disability-related) and subjective factors (subjective well-being, social perception of disability, perceived disability). The results show that 44 % of TSCI persons felt that disabled persons do not constitute a community (the "no-community" group). Of those who recognised the existence of such a community, 34 % said they belonged to it (the "in-community" group) and 22 % declared they did not (the "out-community" group). People in the "no-community" group tended to be more socially integrated, whilst those in the "in-community" group tended to have greater social and clinical difficulties. The "out-community" group was more diverse, being made up of both autonomous persons and dependent persons suffering from complications. Factors related to the sense of community belonging were identified using bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression. Subjective well-being appeared to be independent of any sense of community belonging.

40|$|The UK Government has set {{an ambitious}} {{target of a}} 20 % {{reduction}} in CO 2 emissions by 2010 based on a 1990 baseline. Since buildings account for over 40 % of current CO 2 emissions, the revision of building and building services insulation standards has been a high priority. The previous UK pipe insulation standard (BS 5422 - 1990) {{was based on an}} economic thickness methodology that resulted in thickness requirements for different materials of unequal energy saving value. The 2001 revision (BS 5422 - 2001) not only addresses this imbalance by defining environmental thicknesses that deliver equivalent energy savings but also increases the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 5 million tonnes per annum. To stimulate this potential, the UK Government has introduced a tax incentive under the existing Capital Allowances scheme to promote the widespread adoption of the new standard in both new build and, more importantly, in renovation projects. Just as importantly, the new standard highlights the true cost-effectiveness of highly efficient insulation materials such as phenolic foam. Phenolic foam had already gained more than a 15 % market share in the UK pipe insulation market prior to the recent changes to the standard {{on the basis of its}} excellent thermal resistance and fire properties.
