50|$|The {{choice was}} criticised by left-wing {{political}} organiser Matt McCarten, arguing that McKay's previous tenure in the liquor industry {{was marked by}} <b>anti-union</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{that he did not}} object to, and by strong advertising of alcohol to the youth market. Compared to this, the editorial argued, the fact that McKay was to be paid three times the salary of the Prime Minister, had no local government or non-profit experience and was selected by an unelected transition authority, were all to be expected, seeing the lead-up to the new Council.|$|E

Six senior KCTU leaders {{were arrested for}} supporting a national railway strike which the government declared [...] "illegal". According to the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Transport Workers’ Federation: [...] "The government of South Korea and its <b>anti-union</b> <b>behaviour</b> is again in the spotlight of the international community. Its actions run contrary to its obligations to the ILO and also the labour standards in trade agreements with the US and the EU. Further, the government is failing to fulfill its original commitment to the OECD, upon accession, to respect international labour standards." ...|$|E
40|$|Douglas Renwick (2003) {{said that}} the {{personnel}} function {{plays the role of}} guardian of employeesʼ wellbeing, but on the other hand, he said that personnel managers also tamper with the wellbeing of employees. Looking at Renwickʼs theory through Ulrichʼs model of personnel managers as guardians of employeesʼ wellbeing, they play the role of strategic partners, managers of the changes {{and the role of the}} employees representatives. Gantz and Hayes (inPayne and Wayland, 1999) explicated a few fields where we can talk of ethical conflict while performing these roles: discrimination, psychological tests, <b>anti-union</b> <b>behaviour,</b> design of work flow, job insecurity, discipline, confidentiality, privacy, and firing because of technological redundancy. In this paper we explore the field of potential and real ethical conflicts of human resource managers. What are the most important values of human resources managers? In which areas do ethical conflicts occur? And how do they solve these conflicts on an everyday basis? We used questionnaires to gather data onthese issues. We found out that managers who are in leading positions sufferthe most, next are those who have had long tenure. In this situation ethical codes donʼt help much...|$|E
40|$|The way {{it really}} works Rio Tinto {{is one of the}} world’s biggest mining and metals companies. It faces controversies around the globe for: • <b>anti-union</b> <b>behaviour</b> • {{failures}} in worker health and safety • increased use of precarious workers • poor relationships with communities • irresponsible political activity • failure to respect indigenous peoples’ rights • lack of transparency These controversies point to systematic failures in Rio Tinto’s approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Rio Tinto’s practices not only bring risks to its major stakeholders, such as workers, local communities and investors. They also expose the company to financial, reputational, legal and operational risks. The company’s poor practices constitute a governance gap preventing it from adequately managing the risks in its sector. Investors and others must assess these risks and try to engage Rio Tinto on its unsustainable behaviour. One way is by entering into dialogue and raising questions with the company to seek clarification for the issues discussed here, and urging changes in corporate practices where needed (model questions provided at the end). Why Rio Tinto? Rio Tinto is an industry leader and portrays itself as socially responsible – Rio Tinto’s own claims call for it to be held to a higher standard. But its behaviour is not that of a leader in social responsibility. Rio Tinto needs {{to live up to the}} reputation it paints for itself, and for its actions to match its words. Workers ’ rights Rio Tinto calls its employees the “foundation of our success”, claiming that “their safety is always our first concern. ”i However the company’s treatment of workers and trade unions, its health and safety record, as well as increasing use of precarious labour, tell a different story. Freedom of association and collective bargaining Freedom of association and the effective recognition of collective bargaining are universal and fundamental human rights enshrined in International Labour Organization (ILO) Core Conventions No. 87 and No. 98. ii Freedom of association is also a right proclaimed in th...|$|E
