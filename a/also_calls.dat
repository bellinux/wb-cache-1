Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He <b>also</b> <b>calls</b> Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
