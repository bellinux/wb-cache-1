5|$|Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark's Pond, {{where she}} {{suggests}} using the machine lodged inside Cartman {{to contact the}} visitors. To lure them back, the children tie Cartman to a tree <b>and,</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> he farts, a massive satellite dish emerges from his anus. The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with the cows in the area, having {{found them to be}} the most intelligent species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye.|$|E
25|$|The seven Pennsylvanian white traders with John Findley/Finley's crew {{consisted}} of James Lowry, David Hendricks, Alexander McGinty, Jabez Evans, Jacob Evans, William Powell, Thomas Hyde, and their Cherokee slave.

Findley fled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> a white person went to Eskippathiki, the whole town was burnt down to the ground.|$|E
500|$|His family {{released}} a statement describing Armstrong as a [...] "reluctant American hero [...] served his nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut... While we mourn {{the loss of a}} very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves. For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink." [...] This prompted many responses, including the Twitter hashtag [...] "#WinkAtTheMoon".|$|E

500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> you see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E
2500|$|Konoe {{justified}} his demission to {{his secretary}} Kenji Tomita. [...] "Of course His Imperial Majesty is a pacifist and {{he wished to}} avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday {{but you do not}} have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E
