5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence <b>and</b> <b>wit</b> and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her, while others suggest that Diotima {{was in fact a}} historical figure. According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
5|$|Stewart {{spent the}} next two years working in Russia as a tutor, {{teaching}} English. He learned the Russian language and wrote a book describing his experiences and the country, Provincial Russia. Returning to England, he took up an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Liverpool. In 1912, he accepted a professorship teaching classics at Canterbury College, in Christchurch, New Zealand. At the college, later to become the University of Canterbury, he acquired a reputation for his energy <b>and</b> <b>wit.</b> In his leisure time, he often went climbing in the Southern Alps.|$|E
5|$|An often {{overlooked}} influence upon Benchley's early professional career was the admiration and friendship of the Canadian economist, academic, and humorist Dr. Stephen Leacock. From Toronto Leacock closely followed the increasing body of Benchley's published humor <b>and</b> <b>wit,</b> and opened correspondence between them. He admitted to occasional borrowing of a Benchley topic {{for his own}} reflection and writings. Eventually, he began lobbying gently for Benchley to compile his columns into book form, and in 1922 was delighted with {{the result of his}} nagging. For his part – in a tribute to Leacock – Benchley later said he wrote everything Leacock ever wrote. They had a marvelous friendship.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance <b>and</b> <b>wit</b> {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an outlet for her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. Martin {{has stated that}} Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning <b>and</b> <b>wit</b> making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E
5|$|In a long {{article in}} Le Figaro in July 1856, Offenbach traced {{the history of}} comic opera. He {{declared}} that the first work worthy to be called opéra-comique was Philidor's 1759 Blaise le savetier, and he described the gradual divergence of Italian and French notions of comic opera, with verve, imagination and gaiety from Italian composers, and cleverness, common sense, good taste <b>and</b> <b>wit</b> from the French composers. He concluded that comic opera had become too grand and inflated. His disquisition was a preliminary to the announcement of an open competition for aspiring composers. A jury of French composers and playwrights including Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, Charles Gounod and Eugène Scribe considered 78 entries; the five short-listed entrants were all asked to set a libretto, Le docteur miracle, written by Ludovic Halévy and Léon Battu. The joint winners were Georges Bizet and Charles Lecocq. Bizet became, and remained, a devoted friend of Offenbach. Lecocq and Offenbach took a dislike to one another, and their subsequent rivalry was not altogether friendly.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To analyse the ANB <b>and</b> <b>Wits</b> values <b>and</b> {{to study}} {{correlations}} {{between those two}} measurements and other measurements in diagnosing the anteroposterior maxilo-mandibular relationship with CBCT. Study Design: Ninety patients who had previously a CBCT (i-CAT ®) as a diagnostic register were selected. A 3 D cephalometry was designed using one software package, InVivo 5 ®. This cephalometry included 3 planes of reference, 3 angle measurements and 1 linear measurement. The {{means and standard deviations}} of the mean of each measurement were assessed. After that, a Pearson's correlation coefficient has been performed to analyse the significance of each relationship. Results: When classifying the sample according to the anteroposterior relationship, the values obtained of ANB (Class I: 53 %; Class II: 37 %; Class III: 10 %) <b>and</b> <b>Wits</b> (Class I: 35 %; Class II: 56 %; Class III: 9 %) did not coincide, except for the Class III group. However, of the patients classified differently (Class I and Class II patients) by ANB <b>and</b> <b>Wits,</b> a high percentage of individuals (n= 22; 49 %), had a mesofacial pattern with a mandibular plane angle within normal values. A correlation has been found between ANB <b>and</b> <b>Wits</b> (r= 0, 262), occlusal plane angle and ANB (r= 0, 426), and mandibular plane angle <b>and</b> <b>Wits</b> (r= 0, 242). No correlation was found between either Wits or ANB in relation with the age of the individuals. Conclusions: ANB <b>and</b> <b>Wits</b> must be included in 3 D cephalometric analyses as both are necessary to undertake a more accurate diagnosis of the maxillo-mandibular relationship of the patients...|$|R

5|$|Wilde's life {{continues}} to fascinate, {{and he has}} been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up (1939) and his Autobiography he was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde: His Life <b>and</b> <b>Wit</b> (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.|$|E
