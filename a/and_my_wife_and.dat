Priestley wrote in his Memoirs that [...] "the settlement was given up, but being here, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> myself liking the place, I have determined to take up my residence here, though subject to many disadvantages. Philadelphia was excessively expensive, and this a comparatively cheap place; and my sons, settling in the neighborhood, will be less exposed to temptation, {{and more likely to}} form habits of sobriety and industry." ...|$|E

There was a great celebration. “In different places they started to sing songs of praise for me. [...] Frank Goings, {{the chief of the}} Indian Police and interpreter for the agency, had brought the Boys’ Band from the boarding school, with all their instruments. In between the Indian songs, the band would play. I then started giving away things I had brought along. I kept this up until I had given away everything I owned, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> I walked away with practically nothing. [...] We figured that we gave away that day about a thousand dollars’ worth of goods ourselves, not counting all the presents that had been donated to be distributed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1995, the McCombs {{sold the}} house to a local real estate agent, Christopher Shellabear: [...] "“Our family all left home <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> I were {{rattling}} around in this huge house”, Harold McComb explained. On 30 June 1995, following receipt of petition from local residents worried about the potential redevelopment of the site, the Heritage Council of Western Australia issued a Stop Work (or Conservation) order under Section 59 of the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990. On 17 July 1995, Chris Shellabear sold the now-encumbered property to Sharon Creasy, wife of prospector Mark Creasy, for $2.7 million. On 10 October 1995, the Heritage Council of Western Australia added the property to the State Register of Heritage Places on an [...] "interim" [...] basis. The Creasys contested the interim listing for nine years, and in 2004 the Heritage Council removed the dwelling from the interim listing {{and placed it on}} the permanent register. [...] There was a legal dispute as to whether the listing was done correctly, resulting in the Heritage Council re-registering it on the permanent list in May 2005. The Creasys estimate that the dispute has cost them $225,000 in legal fees and claim that the house is now uninhabitable, estimating it would cost at least $2.8 million to make it liveable and much more to renovate it completely.|$|E
