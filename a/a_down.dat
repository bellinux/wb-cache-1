5|$|The Cacchios {{expressed}} a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers, because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre. To make the transfer of ownership easier, the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a deal could be reached, and to assist in the operation of the Theatre after its sale to the RTC. By late February 2010 the RTC had raised $45,000, and needed to reach a total of $600,000. After <b>a</b> <b>down</b> payment of $160,000, and paying the full cost of the property, the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building. Over $8,000 was raised in a silent auction on February28. More than 100 people attended the auction, including Congressman Maurice Hinchey.|$|E

5|$|The Theatre outpaced 362 other Pepsi Refresh entrants, and was {{in first}} place {{by the middle of}} April.

By late May, the group had won the April competition and was waiting for the Pepsi funds, before tendering <b>a</b> <b>down</b> payment on the Theatre, initially planned for June10. The closing date of the sale was pushed back to allow time to finalize the deal.
