40|$|The Southern Apennine fold {{and thrust}} belt differs {{from other parts}} of the peri-Tyrrhenian orogen. In most of the peri-Tyrrhenian belt, {{hinterland}} extension is oriented at a high-angle to the orogen axis and appears to be related to rifting and formation of oceanic crust within the Tyrrhenian basin. The Southern Apennines share the late-stage development of normal faults related to the opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea, but also experienced an episode of extension parallel to the strike of the tectonic belt. The orogen-parallel extension was apparently formed in response to the increase in length of the deformed belt during <b>arcuation.</b> <b>Arcuation</b> ostensibly was related to asymmetrical rifting in the hinterland, which was greater in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea than in areas to the north, and proportionately greater shortening in the frontal parts of the southern belt as compared to regions in the north. During <b>arcuation,</b> extension was spatially concentrated within structural domains and was accomplished by displacement on low-angle detachment faults cutting through a previously imbricated thrust stack. During the Miocene-Pliocene, NNW-SSE extension in the interior of the Southern Apennine belt formed coevally with ENE-WSW shortening in the foreland. Longitudinal extension ceased in the Pleistocene, when younger high-angle normal faults formed in response to the easterly migration of Tyrrhenian Sea rifting and NE-SW extension associated with lithospheric stretching...|$|E
40|$|During late Cenozoic thrusting, the {{interior}} of the peri-Tyrrhenian orogenic belt in the southern Apennines underwent two episodes of nearly orthogonal extension. Early extension was oriented subparallel to the axis of the tectonic belt and formed in response to progressive thrust-belt <b>arcuation.</b> The length of the tectonic belt increased by approximately 50 %, and the longitudinal strain was accommodated by low-angle normal faults concentrated in tectonic domains recording up to 150 %- 200 % extension. Younger extension, oriented at a high angle to the orogen, was accompanied by Pliocene-Pleistocene uplift and by southeasterly migration of Tyrrhenian Sea rifting...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of environment pollution by metallurgical industry emissions on woody plants bearing parameters was examined. The results obtained show the decrease of bearing rate, diminution of seeds, fruits and seed cells sizes in woody plants affected by technogenic emissions. Attenuation of the 1000 seeds’ weight was established. Incresing {{the amount of}} fruits with development deviations was ascertained. It was found aplasia and abnormal form of the samara fruit of ash and ailanthus trees, <b>arcuation</b> and narrowing of {{some parts of the}} catalpa fruitcases. Practical recommendations on using seeds’ sensitive parameters in biomonitoring of woody phytocenoses under technogenic stressful conditions are proposed...|$|E
40|$|The Cape Fold Belt syntaxis {{displays}} antitaxial bends {{on either}} side of a well-developed intermediate fold trend. Folds of the NW-trending and E-trending branches merge relatively smoothly with the NE-trending syntaxial folds. The general pattern of fold coalescence, <b>arcuations</b> and the presence of many smaller folds of divergent trends show strong similarities with patterns generated in experimental models simulating the shortening of a multilayer simultaneously in two perpendicular directions and at unlike magnitudes. Interference between structures formed in response to different shortening directions led to a distinct regional variation of fold trends in the Witteberg Group of the Ceres arc. The special fold overprinting relationships at fold intersections in this area are interpreted in terms of bulk constrictional deformation. The structure of the syntaxis is probably the combined effect of the superpositioning of two roughly coeval, non-coaxial fold belts upon a much larger nonrotational arc, initially formed by the molding of the orogen around the irregular shape of the craton. © 1995.

40|$|Sumithion {{is widely}} used to control brittle in paddy fields and tiger bug in fish larval rearing ponds. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to elucidate the toxic effects of sumithion on larval stages of stinging catfish Heteropneustes fossilis. Larvae were exposed to two concentrations (150 and 250 μg/L) of sumithion with one control in three replicates of each. Larvae samples were collected at 20 - and 24 -h intervals followed by observation under a digital microscope. Exposures of stinging catfish larvae to sumithion produced deformities including irregular head shape, lordosis, yolk sac edema, body <b>arcuation,</b> tissue ulceration, etc. The mortality rates of larvae were significantly increased in response to increase in sumithion concentrations. Furthermore, around 30 % of the total adult stinging catfish reared in sumithiontreated aquaculture ponds were found to be deformed permanently. These findings highlight that exposure of stinging catfish to sumithion at the critical and sensitive stages in their life cycle may significantly reduce the number of returning adults. Therefore, the use of sumithion for crop protection needs to be considered carefully and alternatives to sumithion should to be developed for controlling aquatic insects in aqua-ponds during larval rearing. </p...|$|E
40|$|While {{studying}} {{the small but}} interesting collection of Blattidae, submitted to me for study by Mr. C. Willemse of Eygelshoven (L.), I found a new Blattid for which I propose the name Hormetica luteomarginata nov. spec. The new species is represented in the Willemse collection by two male specimens. It belongs to the forms having the tegmina marked with black and the tegmina and wings extending beyond {{the apex of the}} abdomen. The most striking features are the fully developed tegmina and wings, the black band extending along the anal sulcus and the yellowly bordered black abdomen. Type ♂; Esperito Santo, Brazil (Willemse collection). Size medium for the genus, form moderately depressed, elliptical (fig. 1). Head in dorsal aspect not visible cephalad of pronotum, in cephalic aspect broad cordiform, greatest width across eyes nearly equal to greatest depth (as 12 to 13), face flattened, with scattered punctulae; the area between the eyes is slightly depressed; occipital interspace between eyes broad, half the entire width of head and equal to eleven-twelfth of that between the internal margins of antennal scrobes; ocellar spots mesad of eyes, with a faint transverse impression between them; maxillary palpi with ultimate article longer than penultimate and shorter than antepenultimate, the proportions Fig. i. Hormetica luteomarginata nov. spec, dorsal view of male. X 3. being as 20, 17 and 23 respectively; the penultimate being infundibuliform.

40|$|The Vanrhynsdorp {{foreland}} thrust-fold belt forms {{part of the}} polycychc Pan-African orogeny (∼ 650 - 450 Ma), which affected mobile {{belts and}} their foreland deposits on the African continent. The Vanrhynsdorp Group was deposited in a peripheral foreland basin cratonward of the Neoproterozoic Gariep belt. This belt is a transpressive collision orogen that developed when the southern African plate collided with the South American plate during {{the construction of the}} Gondwana supercontinent. The foreland basin was deformed by the same southeasterly transpression late during the orogeny leading to a NE-vergent, thin-skinned foreland thrust-fold belt. The thrust-fold belt shows progressive fold, thrust and cleavage development from northeast to southwest accompanied by an increase in metamorphic grade from diagenetic to biotite-grade greenwhist facies. The clockwise cleavage transection in the belt is ascribed to sinistral transpression, probably accompanied by reverse-slip reactivation of a basement fault that may have been the original rift-margin of the older Gariep trough. Shortening across this oblique basement ramp led to <b>arcuation</b> and the formation of a high strain zone and sirristral offset in the foreland deposits above. Lateral ramp style, thin-skinned step-thrusting and transected folding occur northeast of this zone. To the southwest, the imbricate thrust duplex contains wedges of the older Gariep belt that were thrust over the foreland margin and backfolded during progressive forward propagation of the thrust belt. Far to the southwest, along the coast, Kibaran basement slices overrode the Gariep metasediments. The minimum finite shortening across the belt is estimated to be ∼ 35 %. Prograde metamorphism associated with the transpressive thrust-fold event in the foreland belt culminated at ∼ 496 Ma and was dated by 40 Ar 39 Ar step-heating of cleavage micas. © 1995.
