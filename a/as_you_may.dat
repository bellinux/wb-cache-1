5|$|As Punakha Dzong {{is located}} at only 1,200 meters, you will not suffer from oxygen {{shortages}} as you would in higher places such as Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest), {{so it is a}} good place for beginner hiker to start from, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> struggle with altitude sickness in the first few days. Punakha is also the center of Bhutan’s longest suspension bridge (Punakha Suspension Bridge) and is about 7.5km (4.5 miles) by car to Chimi Lhakhang, the Divine Madman’s fertility temple.|$|E

25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> conclude when I mention that I still {{am able to}} skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E

500|$|Controversy arose for the {{commercial}} {{when it was}} reported that Lopez did not return to The Bronx to shoot {{the commercial}}. Instead, Lopez filmed her close-up shots in Los Angeles, while a body double was used for the car scenes through The Bronx. Fiat and Lopez were slammed for false advertising Lopez's return to The Bronx. Fiat released a statement stating: [...] "Both commercials featuring Jennifer Lopez were indeed filmed in the Bronx as well as outside locations. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> know, in today's world, people are increasingly mobile and their work takes them to a variety of locations. As a result, we took the opportunity to film wherever Ms. Lopez was working at the time to accommodate her schedule. The commercial tells the story of how the simple elements of our upbringing can help explain who we are, where we're going and serve as a source of inspiration to achieve our goals in life. One {{does not need to be}} in a specific location to be inspired or continue to be inspired." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, set {{photos of}} Robert Downey Jr. driving {{a new model}} Acura were {{published}} online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, [...] "As you may know, Acura {{has been in the}} Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for The Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying {{the development of a new}} sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time." [...] In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.|$|E
500|$|Once in China, Butler was {{initially}} deployed at Tientsin. He {{took part in}} the Battle of Tientsin on July 13, 1900 and in the subsequent Gaselee Expedition, during which he saw the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers. When he saw another Marine officer fall wounded, he climbed out of a trench to rescue him. Butler was then himself shot in the thigh. Another Marine helped him get to safety, but also was shot. Despite his leg wound, Butler assisted the wounded officer to the rear. Four enlisted men would receive the Medal of Honor in the battle. Butler's commanding officer, Major Littleton W. T. Waller, personally commended him and wrote that [...] "for such reward <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> deem proper the following officers: Lieutenant Smedley D. Butler, for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week, for saving a wounded man at the risk of his own life, and under a very severe fire." [...] Commissioned officers were not then eligible to receive the Medal of Honor, and Butler instead received a promotion to captain by brevet while he recovered in the hospital, two weeks before his nineteenth birthday.|$|E

Farhad Manjoo, the site's technology columnist, went to considerable lengths to acquire a Zune HD. [...] " [...] wasn't as complete a failure <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> believe," [...] he wrote.

2500|$|Like many Victorian scholars, Mandell Creighton {{assumed that}} his wife would be an {{accessory}} in his academic pursuits, {{and that he would}} have the upper hand in their intellectual relationship.

2500|$|In 1907, Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr., {{suggested}} that Heywood {{might have been}} influenced by Lucian’s Icaro-Menippus when representing Jupiter on earth, notably the passage: “…close to every one was placed a golden chair. [...] Jupiter sat down in the first he came to, and lifting up the lid, listened to the prayers, which, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> suppose, were of various kinds…One sailor asked for a north-wind, another for a south; the husbandmen prayed for rain, and the fuller for sun-shine…One petition, indeed, puzzled him a little; two men asking favors of him, directly contrary to each other, at the same time, and promising the same sacrifice; he was at a loss which to oblige.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As the {{deadline}} of January 31 passed, the new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Q. Smith, wrote that [...] "without {{the receipt of}} any news of Sitting Bull's submission, I see no reason why, in {{the discretion of the}} Hon. the Secretary of War, military operations against him should not commence at once." [...] His superior, Secretary of the Interior Zachariah Chandler agreed, adding that [...] "the said Indians are hereby turned over to the War Department for such action {{on the part of the}} Army <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> deem proper under the circumstances." [...] On February 8, 1876, General Sheridan telegraphed Generals Crook and Terry, ordering them to commence their winter campaigns against the [...] "hostiles". The Great Sioux War of 1876–77 had begun.|$|E
2500|$|Walton did not {{profess to}} be an expert with a fishing fly; the fly fishing in his first edition was contributed by Thomas Barker, a retired cook and humorist, who {{produced}} a treatise of his own in 1659; but {{in the use of the}} live worm, the grasshopper and the frog [...] "Piscator" [...] himself could speak as a master. The famous passage about the frog, often misquoted as being about the worm—"use him as though you loved him, that is, harm him as little <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> possibly, that he may live the longer"—appears in the original edition. Cotton's additions completed the instruction in fly fishing and advised on the making of artificial flies where he listed sixty five varieties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{treatment}} of the Mamluk captives by the Portuguese however, was brutal. The Viceroy ordered most {{of them to be}} hanged, burned alive or torn to pieces, tied to the mouths of cannon, in retaliation for his son's death. Commenting {{in the aftermath of the}} battle Almeida reported to King Manuel: [...] "As long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be powerful at sea, you will hold India as yours; and if you do not possess this power, little will avail you a fortress on the shore." [...] Interestingly, after handing over the Viceroy's post to Afonso de Albuquerque and leaving for Portugal in November 1509, Almeida was himself killed in December in a skirmish against the Khoikhoi tribe near the Cape of Good Hope, along with 70 other Portuguese - more than in the Battle of Diu. His body was buried on the beach, but subsequently never found.|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1890s, he {{had many}} songs in his repertory, {{and he was in}} demand from audiences. The Entr'Acte wrote, [...] "Champion is a comic singer who is endowed with genuine humour, which is {{revealed}} in his several songs, of which the audience never seems to get enough". His earliest known recording success was in 1896 with [...] "In the World Turned Upside Down", followed by [...] "Down Fell the Pony in a Fit" [...] in 1897. In 1898 Champion ceased his style of alternating songs and patter and instead adopted a quick fire delivery in order for him to perform as many songs as he could during his act. He retained this style of delivery for the remainder of his career, remarking, [...] "At one time I used to sing songs with plenty of patter but I changed the style for a new idea of my own, and started [...] "quick singing". I think I am the only comedian who sings songs all in a lump, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> say".|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt is a {{longtime}} opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q at Richmond International Raceway the previous year. [...] "I think it means something different to me {{than it does to}} y'all..." [...] he responded. He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: [...] "We live in a country where you can speak freely and do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may.</b> I don't know (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not going to agree with everything everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it." [...] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: [...] "I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Run This Town" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Following the leak of the song, Tom Breihan, Pitchfork gave a positive review. [...] "The new Jay-Z/Kanye West/Rihanna track from 'The Blueprint 3', leaked this morning, and it bangs. Jay's 'D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)' left {{the impression that}} The Blueprint 3 might be a cantankerous grumpy-old-man rap album, but 'Run This Town' totally obliterates that. Thanks to a molten motivational Rihanna chorus, it's pop-friendly as hell, without compromising Jay's fundamental hardness. And Jay is actually rapping like he cares, something he's only done intermittently {{over the last few}} years. Still, Kanye gets the hottest line on the song: 'What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' RAV 4?'" [...] Following the album's release, Pitchfork made another review of the song, again praising the track. [...] "There's something for everybody: Jay [...] sounds engaged in a way he rarely has since unretiring, Rihanna coos those [...] "ay ay"s the radio loves, and Kanye West, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> have read, once again upstages the guy he's producing.
