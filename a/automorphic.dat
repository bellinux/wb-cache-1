5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also <b>automorphic.</b> Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|These {{operations}} {{define a}} symmetry relation between equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and {{with respect to}} the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a subgroup of the symmetric group S81, of order 3!8×2=3,359,232. Applying the above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!8×2×9! essentially equivalent grids. Exceptions are <b>Automorphic</b> Sudokus which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.|$|E

25|$|<b>Automorphic</b> {{forms are}} a {{generalization}} of modular forms to more general analytic functions, perhaps of several complex variables, with similar transformation properties. The generalization involves replacing the modular group PSL2 (R) and a chosen congruence subgroup by a semisimple Lie group G and a discrete subgroup Γ. Just as modular forms {{can be viewed}} as differential forms on a quotient of the upper half space H = PSL2 (R)/SO(2), <b>automorphic</b> forms {{can be viewed as}} differential forms (or similar objects) on Γ\G/K, where K is (typically) a maximal compact subgroup of G. Some care is required, however, as the quotient typically has singularities. The quotient of a semisimple Lie group by a compact subgroup is a symmetric space and so the theory of <b>automorphic</b> forms is intimately related to harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces.|$|E

25|$|Klein {{summarized}} {{his work}} on <b>automorphic</b> and elliptic modular functions in a four volume treatise, written with Robert Fricke {{over a period of}} about 20 years.|$|E
25|$|In his 1884 {{book on the}} icosahedron, Klein set out {{a theory}} of <b>automorphic</b> functions, {{connecting}} algebra and geometry. However Poincaré published an outline of his theory of <b>automorphic</b> functions in 1881, {{which led to a}} friendly rivalry between the two men. Both sought to state and prove a grand uniformization theorem that would serve as a capstone to the emerging theory. Klein succeeded in formulating such a theorem and in sketching a strategy for proving it. But while doing this work his health collapsed, as mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} question is the existence of automorphisms in recursion-theoretic structures. One of these structures {{is that one of}} recursively enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite difference; in this structure, A is below B if and only if the set difference B'A is finite. Maximal sets (as defined in the previous paragraph) have the property that they cannot be <b>automorphic</b> to non-maximal sets, that is, if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned, then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set. Soare (1974) showed that also the converse holds, that is, every two maximal sets are <b>automorphic.</b> So the maximal sets form an orbit, that is, every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other by some automorphism. Harrington gave a further example of an <b>automorphic</b> property: that of the creative sets, the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem.|$|E
25|$|Modular form {{theory is}} a special case of the more general theory of <b>automorphic</b> forms, and {{therefore}} can now be seen as just the most concrete part of a rich theory of discrete groups.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} his degree, Poincaré {{began teaching}} as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At {{the same time}} he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of <b>automorphic</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|Harmonic {{analysis}} {{has also been}} extended from the analysis of functions on a group G to functions on homogeneous spaces for G. The theory is particularly well developed for symmetric spaces and provides a theory of <b>automorphic</b> forms (discussed below).|$|E
25|$|Representation {{theory is}} used {{in many parts of}} mathematics, as well as in quantum {{chemistry}} and physics. Among other things it {{is used in}} algebra to examine the structure of groups. There are also applications in harmonic analysis and number theory.

25|$|The {{following}} {{are examples of}} problems in analytic number theory: the prime number theorem, the Goldbach conjecture (or the twin prime conjecture, or the Hardy–Littlewood conjectures), the Waring problem and the Riemann hypothesis. Some {{of the most important}} tools of analytic number theory are the circle method, sieve methods and L-functions (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of modular forms (and, more generally, <b>automorphic</b> forms) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.|$|E
25|$|Poisson {{summation}} {{is generally}} {{associated with the}} physics of periodic media, such as heat conduction on a circle. The fundamental solution of the heat equation on a circle is called a theta function. It is used in number theory to prove the transformation properties of theta functions, which {{turn out to be}} a type of modular form, and it is connected more generally to the theory of <b>automorphic</b> forms where it appears on one side of the Selberg trace formula.|$|E
25|$|Definitions of orbifold {{have been}} given several times: by Satake {{in the context of}} <b>automorphic</b> forms in the 1950s under the name V-manifold; by Thurston {{in the context of the}} {{geometry}} of 3-manifolds in the 1970s when he coined the name orbifold, after a vote by his students; and by Haefliger in the 1980s in the context of Gromov's programme on CAT(k) spaces under the name orbihedron. The definition of Thurston will be described here: it is the most widely used and is applicable in all cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} modular forms was {{developed}} in four periods: first {{in connection with the}} theory of elliptic functions, {{in the first part of}} the nineteenth century; then by Felix Klein and others towards the end of the nineteenth century as the <b>automorphic</b> form concept became understood (for one variable); then by Erich Hecke from about 1925; and then in the 1960s, as the needs of number theory and the formulation of the modularity theorem in particular made it clear that modular forms are deeply implicated.|$|E
25|$|An {{isomorphism}} of the Möbius {{group with}} the Lorentz group was noted by several authors: Based on previous work of Felix Klein (1893, 1897) on <b>automorphic</b> functions related to hyperbolic geometry and Möbius geometry, Gustav Herglotz (1909) showed that hyperbolic motions (i.e. isometric automorphisms of a hyperbolic space) transforming the unit sphere into itself correspond to Lorentz transformations, by which Herglotz was able to classify the one-parameter Lorentz transformations into loxodromic, elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic groups. Other authors include Emil Artin (1957), H. S. M. Coxeter (1965) and by Roger Penrose and Wolfgang Rindler (1984).|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s1950s, Ellis Kolchin, Armand Borel, and Claude Chevalley {{realised}} {{that many}} foundational results concerning Lie groups {{can be developed}} completely algebraically, giving rise {{to the theory of}} algebraic groups defined over an arbitrary field. This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most finite simple groups, as well as in algebraic geometry. The theory of <b>automorphic</b> forms, an important branch of modern number theory, deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over adele rings; p-adic Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.|$|E
25|$|Number {{theory is}} {{the theory of}} the {{positive}} integers. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and congruence. Its fundamental theorem states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In some ways it is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding <b>automorphic</b> forms, which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.|$|E
25|$|The fewest {{number of}} clues {{possible}} for a proper Sudoku is 17 (proven January 2012, and confirmed September 2013). Over 49,000 Sudokus with 17 clues have been found, many by Japanese enthusiasts. Sudokus with 18 clues and rotational symmetry have been found, {{and at least one}} Sudoku is known with 18 clues and exhibits two-way diagonal symmetry, and is <b>automorphic.</b> The maximum number of clues that can be provided while still not rendering a unique solution is four short of a full grid (77); if two instances of two numbers each are missing from cells that occupy the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, the numbers can be assigned two ways. Since this applies to Latin squares in general, most variants of Sudoku have the same maximum.|$|E
25|$|Weil {{introduced}} the adele {{ring in the}} late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley's lead with the ideles, and gave a proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his Basic Number Theory in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' (vector bundle avant la lettre) Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in <b>automorphic</b> representation theory. He picked up another credited Weil conjecture, around 1967, which later under pressure from Serge Lang (resp. of Serre) {{became known as the}} Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (resp. Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.|$|E
500|$|A Sudoku grid is <b>automorphic</b> {{if it can}} be {{transformed}} in a way that leads back to the original grid, when that same transformation would not otherwise lead back to the original grid.

2500|$|Before the {{development}} of the general theory, many important special cases were worked out in detail, including the Hilbert modular forms and Siegel modular forms. Important results in the theory include the Selberg trace formula and the realization by Robert Langlands that the Riemann-Roch theorem could be applied to calculate the dimension of the space of <b>automorphic</b> forms. The subsequent notion of [...] "automorphic representation" [...] has proved of great technical value for dealing with the case that G is an algebraic group, treated as an adelic algebraic group.

The proof of the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields by [...] is possibly the single strongest theoretical reason {{in favor of the}} Riemann hypothesis. This provides some evidence for the more general conjecture that all zeta functions associated with <b>automorphic</b> forms satisfy a Riemann hypothesis, which includes the classical Riemann hypothesis as a special case. Similarly Selberg zeta functions satisfy the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, and are in some ways similar to the Riemann zeta function, having a functional equation and an infinite product expansion analogous to the Euler product expansion.

The Riemann hypothesis for the Goss zeta function was proved by [...] In contrast to these positive examples, however, some Epstein zeta functions do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis, even though they have an infinite number of zeros on the critical line [...] These functions are quite similar to the Riemann zeta function, and have a Dirichlet series expansion and a functional equation, but the ones known to fail the Riemann hypothesis do not have an Euler product and are not directly related to <b>automorphic</b> representations.|$|E
