5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|Scrolling {{through a}} long list or menu is {{achieved}} by sliding <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves {{as if it is}} pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.|$|E
5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E

5|$|The light {{infantry}} of 1,200 velites {{consisted of}} unarmoured skirmishing troops {{drawn from the}} youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and buckler (90cm (3ft) diameter), {{as well as several}} light javelins, each with a 90cm (3ft) wooden shaft the diameter of <b>a</b> <b>finger,</b> with a c.25cm (10in) narrow metal point. Their numbers were swollen by the addition of allied light infantry and irregular rorarii.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Test. Brown injured <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> while fielding in the first innings, so he was unable to bat in Australia's first innings. In the second innings, Australia's {{makeshift}} openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs for victory to complete a 10-wicket win in less than an hour.|$|E
5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from <b>a</b> <b>finger.</b> An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{faced the}} {{possibility}} of becoming {{a free agent after}} the 2007 season, but he resigned with the Roughriders by February 2008. Adams was challenged by Brent Curvey and Ronald Flemons in training camp, but he won the starting role for the 2008 season. Playing in 14 games, he made 11 tackles and two fumble recoveries. Adams missed a regular season game in July to visit his mother, who was undergoing cancer surgery, and he also spent time on the injured list due to <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> injury and sprained ankle. The Roughriders made the playoffs, but lost to the BC Lions 33–12 in the West Semi-Final.|$|E
5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes {{because they were too}} difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of <b>a</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> forked <b>fingering</b> is <b>a</b> <b>fingering</b> {{in which}} <b>an</b> open hole has covered holes below it: fingerings {{for which the}} {{uncovering}} of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 is not <b>a</b> forked <b>fingering,</b> while 0123 56 is <b>a</b> forked <b>fingering</b> because the open hole 4 has holes covered below it - holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings. Forked fingerings may {{also be used to}} produced microtonal variations in pitch.|$|R
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{he had an}} 11–9 win-loss {{record with}} a career low 3.12 earned run average in 25 games. His 3.12 earned run average was good for eighth in the league. However, Bickford broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> in 1951 after {{being hit by a}} line drive, missed most of the final three months of the season and never regained his prior form. In 1952, he was 7–12 with a 3.74 earned run average in 26 games, 22 of them starts. He played for the Braves when the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season; however, he {{suffered}} from bone spurs in his pitching arm. During the 1953 season, Bickford had a 2–5 win-loss record with a 5.28 earned run average.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Trescothick {{impressed}} Glamorgan coach Duncan Fletcher in {{a county}} match at Taunton, by scoring 167 in a low-scoring match where the next-highest innings was 50. When England opening batsman Nick Knight sustained <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> injury in 2000, Fletcher, who had been appointed England coach, called on Trescothick to make his England debut in the NatWest Series against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. Trescothick's regular selection for England meant that he was rarely available for domestic selection between 2000 and 2006, often playing only a few matches for Somerset {{at the start of}} the season.|$|E

5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball {{video game}} themed after the Metroid series. The game uses the {{graphical}} style and various story elements from Metroid Prime. It {{was developed by}} Fuse Games for the Nintendo DS handheld game console, and released by Nintendo in North America and Australia in 2005, in Japan in 2006, and in Europe in 2007. Metroid Prime Pinball uses the basic mechanics of pinball, along with typical pinball items. New mechanics are introduced, such as wall jumping {{and the ability to}} fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be nudged with <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> to alter the pinball's trajectory while in motion.|$|E

5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of {{his fingers on the}} typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> as this story line comes to a close.|$|E
5|$|Some players {{remained}} {{resentful of}} Craig's dubious elevation ahead of Harvey during the 1957–58 tour of South Africa but appreciated {{that he had}} not promoted himself and that he was fair and open to input from teammates. On the tour, Harvey broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> at catching practice and missed the early tour matches. After it healed, Harvey returned for a match against a South African XI, in a virtual dress rehearsal for the Tests. He scored 173 as the tourists crushed their hosts by an innings.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Test {{was played}} at Headingley, {{starting}} on 22 July, and Australia made two changes. Harvey replaced the injured Sid Barnes, while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallon, who had <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> injury, as wicket-keeper. Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test to open; instead, Hassett {{was promoted to}} open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. As Australia were leading 20 after three Tests, England needed to win the last two Tests to square the series. England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Playing an open string {{simultaneously}} with a stopped note on an adjacent string produces a bagpipe-like drone, often used by composers {{in imitation of}} folk music. Sometimes the two notes are identical (for instance, playing <b>a</b> <b>fingered</b> <b>A</b> on the D string against the open A string), giving a ringing sort of [...] "fiddling" [...] sound.|$|R
