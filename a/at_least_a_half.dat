At the same time, many slaves in the region were also imported from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Many slaves were taken in the wars with the Christian nations of medieval Europe.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new {{propeller}} steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled {{to try and get}} the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E

Directors of new productions have included John Gielgud, Howard Davies and Richard Eyre. The play was made into a 1931 film and has been adapted several times for television and radio.|$|E
500|$|... "I Shall Be Free" [...] is a rewrite of Lead Belly's [...] "We Shall Be Free", {{which was}} {{performed}} by Lead Belly, Sonny Terry, Cisco Houston, and Woody Guthrie. According to Todd Harvey, Dylan's version draws its melody from the Guthrie recording but omits its signature chorus ("We'll soon be free/When the Lord will call us home"). Critics have been divided about the worth of this final song. Robert Shelton dismissed the song as [...] "a decided anticlimax. Although the album has <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dozen blockbusters, two of the weakest songs are tucked in at the end, like shirttails." [...] Todd Harvey has argued that by placing the song {{at the close of}} the Freewheelin LP, Dylan ends on a note of levity which is a relief after the weighty sentiments expressed in several songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|Non-avian dinosaur remains are {{occasionally}} found {{above the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. In 2001, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported {{the discovery of}} a single hadrosaur leg-bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, and described it as evidence of Paleocene dinosaurs. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early Paleocene epoch, approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that stratum by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> million years into the Cenozoic Era. Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the Hell Creek Formation up to [...] above the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, representing years of elapsed time. Similar reports have come {{from other parts of the}} world, including China. Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments. Direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with U–Pb dating methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 ± 0.9 million years ago. If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.|$|E

2500|$|The case of Kitty Genovese {{is often}} cited and {{occasionally}} criticized {{as an example of}} the [...] "bystander effect". It is also the case that originally stimulated social psychological research in this area. On March 13, 1964 Genovese, 28 years old, was on her way back to her apartment in Queens, New York, from work at 3am when she was stabbed, sexually assaulted, and murdered in front of multiple witnesses. According to newspaper accounts, the attack lasted for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> an hour during which time Genovese screamed and pleaded for help. The murderer attacked Genovese and stabbed her, then fled the scene after attracting the attention of a neighbor. The killer then returned ten minutes later and finished the assault. Newspaper reports after Genovese's death claimed that 38 witnesses watched the stabbings and failed to intervene or even contact the police until after the attacker fled and Genovese had died. This led to widespread public attention, and many editorials. Psychology researchers Latané and Darley attributed the lack of help by witnesses to diffusion of responsibility. Because each witness saw others witnessing the same event, they assumed that the others would be taking responsibility and calling the police, and therefore did nothing to stop the situation themselves.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{northern}} extremes of their range, Eurasian eagle-owls {{tend to have}} a less varied diet than those to the south and the need to catch significant numbers of rodents rises as they are often the only regularly accessible prey in sparse sub-Arctic environments. In northern Sweden, more than 60% of the food was made up of microtine rodents, i.e. the [...] Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus), the field vole, the European water vole and the [...] grey red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus). In one study from western Russia, rodents comprised more than 90% of the diet of the eagle-owls, led by the [...] steppe lemming (Lagurus lagurus) at 24% by number, the [...] narrow-headed vole (Microtus gregalis) at 21% and the European water vole at 17.9%. Similarly in high altitude tundra of the East Austrian Alps, nearly 90% of the food was found to be comprised by microtine rodents, the [...] European snow vole (Chionomys nivalis) being the most frequently identified species in the diet. In Spain, the [...] Algerian mouse (Mus spretus), at up to 41.8% of the prey by number, and [...] wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), at up to 10.5% by number, are often regularly taken, especially in regions where rabbit numbers have declined.

The Romanian hamster is also dominated the prey list per a study in Bulgaria, only the European water vole follows distantly in number.

In Slovenia, the edible dormouse was the most regularly-recorded prey species, making up 20.2% of the food but it comprised 9.4% of the biomass. The edible dormouse was also the most regular prey species in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Italy, making up 22.5% of the diet.

60|$|The sum of such {{involuntary}} reflection with me {{has been}} the perception that London was and is and shall be, and New York is and shall be, but has hardly yet been. New York is therefore one-third less morally, as she is one-third less numerically, than London. In her future she has no past, but only a present to retrieve; though perhaps a present like hers is enough. She is also one less architecturally than London; she is two- thirds as splendid, as grand, as impressive. In fact, if I more closely examine my pocket vision, I am afraid that I must hedge from this modest claim, for we have as yet nothing to compare with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of London magnificence, whatever we may have in the seventeen or eighteen hundred years that shall bring us of her actual age. As we go fast in all things, we may then surpass her; {{but this is not}} certain, for in her more deliberate way she goes fast, too. In the mean time the materials of comparison, as they lie dispersed in the pocket vision, seem few. The sky-scrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, Madison Square Garden, and some vast rocketing hotels offer themselves rather shrinkingly for the contrast with those miles of imperial and municipal architecture which in London make you forget the leagues of mean little houses, and remember the palaces, the law-courts, the great private mansions, the dignified and shapely flats, the large department stores, the immense hotels, the bridges, the monuments of every kind.|$|E
