Sustainable reuse options for CCR in civil infrastructures, such as road embankments, have been recently evaluated in the laboratory. However, to date there are limited studies on the actual field performance of CCR in stabilizing clayey soils in highway subgrades. In this study, a field trial was conducted to ascertain the viability of using CCR stabilized clayey soil as a highway subgrade course material. Quicklime was selected as a control binder in the field trial for comparison purposes. The construction procedures of the CCR and quicklime stabilizations in two field sections are presented. A series of field tests, including California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test, plate loading test, Benkelman beam deflection test, and dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) test were undertaken after the embankment construction. The results indicated that in the top zone of the filled soil layers with 94 % degree of compaction, the CCR stabilized subgrade soil exhibited higher values of CBR and resilient modulus, and lower values of resilient deflection and DCP Index relative to the quicklime stabilized soil. The field trial results indicated that CCR had negligible environmental effects and furthermore resulted in low construction costs.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates strength {{development and}} the carbon footprint of Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) and Fly Ash (FA) based geopolymer stabilized marine clay. Coode Island Silt (CIS), a soft and highly compressible marine clay present in Melbourne, Australia was investigated for stabilization with the CCR and FA geopolymers. CCR is an industrial by-product obtained from <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>production,</b> high in Ca(OH) 2 and {{was used as a}} green additive to improve strength of the FA based geopolymer binder. The liquid alkaline activator used was a mixture of sodium silicate solution (Na 2 SiO 3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The influential factors studied for the geopolymerization process were Na 2 SiO 3 /NaOH ratio, NaOH concentration, L/FA ratio, initial water content, FA content, CCR content, curing temperature and curing time. The strength of stabilized CIS was found to be strongly dependent upon FA content and NaOH concentration. The optimal ingredient providing the highest strength was found to be dependent on water content. Higher water contents were found to dilute the NaOH concentration, hence the optimal L/FA increases and the optimal Na 2 SiO 3 /NaOH decreases as the water content present in the clay increases. The maximum strength of the FA geopolymer (without CCR) stabilized CIS was found at Na 2 SiO 3 /NaOH = 70 : 30 ratio and L/FA = 1. 0 for clay water content at liquid limit (LL). The role of CCR on the strength of FA geopolymer stabilized CIS can be classified into three zones: inactive, active and quasi-inert. The active zone where CCR content is between 7 % and 12 % is recommended in practice. The 12 % CCR addition can improve up to 1. 5 times the strength of the FA geopolymer. The carbon footprints of the geopolymer stabilized soils were approximately 22 %, 23 % and 43 % lower than those of cement stabilized soil at the same strengths of 400 kPa, 600 kPa and 800 kPa. The reduction in carbon footprints at high strength indicates the effectiveness of FA geopolymer as an alternative and effective green soil stabilizer to traditional Portland cement...|$|R

The kinetics of the reactions of the first excited state of methylene, 1 CH 2, with He, N 2, O 2, H 2 and CH 4 have been measured over the temperature range 43 – 160 K by pulsed laser photolysis, monitoring 1 CH 2 removal by laser induced fluorescence. Low temperatures were obtained with either a pulsed Laval expansion (43 – 134 K) or a, slow flow reaction cell (160 K). The rate coefficients for the reactions with N 2, O 2, H 2 and CH 4 all showed a strong negative temperature dependence. In combination with other literature data, the rate coefficients can be parameterised as: k He (43 < T/K < 800) = (1. 90 ± 0. 23) × 10 − 12 × (T/ 298) 1. 74 ± 0. 16 × exp ((88 ± 23) / T) k N 2 (43 < T/K < 800) = (2. 29 ± 1. 12) × 10 − 12 × (T/ 298) − 2. 15 ± 1. 38 × exp ((- 74 ± 96) / T) + (3. 91 ± 0. 78) × 10 − 11 × exp ((- 469 ± 114) / T) k O 2 (43 < T/K < 300) = (6. 16 ± 1. 09) × 10 − 11 × (T/ 298) − 0. 65 ± 0. 14 k H 2 (43 < T/K < 800) = (1. 10 ± 0. 04) × 10 − 10 × (T/ 298) − 0. 40 ± 0. 06 × exp ((11. 1 ± 6. 9) / T) k CH 4 (43 < T/K < 475) = (8. 20 ± 0. 46) × 10 − 11 × (T/ 298) − 0. 93 ± 0. 10 × exp ((- 20. 5 ± 12. 8) / T) For the reactions of 1 CH 2 with H 2 and CH 4, the branching ratio for quenching to ground state, 3 CH 2, vs chemical reaction was also determined at 160 and 73 K. The values measured (H 2 : 0. 39 ± 0. 10 at 160 K, 0. 78 ± 0. 15 at 73 K; CH 4 : 0. 49 ± 0. 09 at 160 K, 0. 64 ± 0. 19 at 73 K) confirm trends of an increased proportion of reactive loss with increasing temperature determined at higher temperatures. The impacts of the new measurements for Titan's atmosphere have been ascertained using a 1 D chemistry and transport model.

40|$|Improving {{selectivity}} in catalytic {{systems is}} of primary interest {{to a number}} of fields. One means of achieving selectivity is through the use of promoters, or deposited materials that improve catalytic properties. Here, we present the modification of palladium surfaces with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed from thiols. SAM coatings are employed in two systems: metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) sensors and supported palladium catalysts. On MIS sensors, modification with alkanethiol SAMs results in enhanced sensitivity to acetylene. Excellent selectivity for acetylene over ethylene is also observed. The functionalized sensors would serve as excellent acetylene detectors in a variety of applications including the detection of fault gases in transformers and detecting trace <b>acetylene</b> in ethylene <b>production</b> plants. Supported palladium catalysts were modified with SAM coatings for the selective reduction of 1 -epoxy- 3 -butene (EpB) to 1 -epoxybutane. Aside from having significant relevance for the production of value added chemicals, this reaction serves as an excellent probe for the conversion of unsaturated oxygenates derived from biomass {{and it is difficult to}} achieve high selectivity over conventional catalysts. Experiments probing the mechanism for the enhancement observed in sensors and catalysts showed increasing order of the SAM coating results in increasing sensor response or catalyst activity. By varying the chemical composition of the thiols used to create SAMs and by comparing these coatings to surface sulfur, we uncovered that surface sulfur is largely responsible for the enhancement of these devices. However, the hydrocarbon tails of thiols play an important role in controlling surface order. The reaction of EpB on coated and uncoated palladium surfaces was studied in more detail using temperature programmed desorption and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy on model systems in ultra-high vacuum. These experiments showed that on clean palladium, EpB ring opens to form an aldehyde-like intermediate; however, on surfaces coated with SAMs no ring opening is observed. Comparing the desorption energy of EpB to similar molecules suggests it binds through its olefin functionality, and comparing the desorption spectra at different surface coverages on coated surfaces suggests less well-ordered self-assembled monolayers decrease activity by preventing adsorption in active sites...|$|R

Assuming in-situ C- 14 production has contributed insignificantly to the measured C- 14, one can calculate finite ages approaching 70 ka. In practice, defensible finite age determinations involve careful considerations of several critical elements in the procedure. These critical elements are: 1) {{the integrity of the}} sample itself, in terms of younger contaminants and of in situ-produced C- 14; 2) the availability of ''dead'' background material; 3) chemical blank in laboratory preparation of, in this case, benzene; and 4) stability of background and efficiency of the LS counting system. High-sensitivity C- 14 dating reveals a low level of memory effect C- 14 in benzene synthesized in the laboratory from anthracite or marble. This level of C- 14 activity is equivalent to that found in 53 ka old wood, and thus, is not distinguishable from petrochemical benzene used in routine dating.

In this study, we investigate computationally and experimentally the structure of an acousti-cally forced, axisymmetric laminar methane-air diffusion ¯ame in which a cylindrical fuel jet is surrounded by a co¯owing oxidizer jet. The ¯ame is forced by imposing a sinusoidal modulation on the steady fuel ¯ow rate. Rayleigh scattering and spontaneous Raman scattering of the fuel are used to generate the temperature pro®le. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to measure the fuel tube exit velocity over a cycle of the forcing modulation. CH ¯ame emission measurements have been done to predict the excited-state CH (CH*) levels. Computationally, we solve the transient equations for the conservation of total mass, momentum, energy, and species mass with detailed transport and ®nite-rate C 2 chemistry submodels to predict the pressure, velocity, temperature, and species concentrations {{as a function of the}} two inde-pendent spatial coordinates and time. The governing equations are written in primitive variables. Implicit ®nite differences are used to discretize the governing equations and the boundary conditions on a non-staggered, nonuniform grid. Modi®ed damped Newton's method nested with a Bi-CGSTAB iteration is utilized to solve the resulting system of equations. Results of the study include a detailed description of the ¯uid dynamic-thermochemical structure of the ¯ame at a 20 -Hz frequency. A comparison of experi-mentally determined and calculated temperature pro®les and CH * levels agree well. Calculated mole fractions of species indicative of soot production (C 2 H 2, CO) are compared against those levels in the corresponding steady ¯ame and are observed to increase in peak concentration values and spatial extent. Analysis of <b>acetylene</b> <b>production</b> rates reveals additional signi®cant production in the downstream region of the ¯ame at certain times during the ¯ame's cyclic history...|$|E
