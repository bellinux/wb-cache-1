5|$|The 747 was {{conceived}} while air travel was increasing in the 1960s. The era of commercial jet transportation, {{led by the}} enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel. Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by Juan Trippe, president of Pan American World Airways (Pan <b>Am),</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their most important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft {{more than twice the}} size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{company from}} the 2/28th Battalion {{captured}} Victoria shortly after coming ashore, and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff Hill at 10:45 <b>am.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the battalion's companies subsequently captured the hill, while its other companies continued to advance. The 2/28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition {{as the day}} progressed, particularly {{to the west of}} its area of responsibility. During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff Hill (at the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads), with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead {{by the end of the}} day, and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting. After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour, a troop from the 2/11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured it without opposition.|$|E
5|$|About 10 <b>a.m.,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aircraft}} of {{the second}} wave took to the air at 5:25 <b>am.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> 829 Squadron's Barracudas crashed shortly after take-off, resulting {{in the deaths of}} its crew of three, and another aircraft from this squadron was not launched due to engine problems. Only two of the Barracudas in this wave were armed with 1,600-pound bombs. As with the first strike, 40 fighters accompanied the torpedo bombers; these comprised 10 Corsairs from 1834 and 1836 Naval Air Squadrons, all of the 20 Wildcats assigned to 896 and 898 Naval Air Squadrons and 10 Hellcats from 804 Naval Air Squadron. All aircraft were launched by 5:37 am, and the force had an uneventful flight to the Kaafjord area. While the German defences were now alert, the artificial smoke screen being generated around Kaafjord was not yet sufficient to hide Tirpitz from view.|$|E
25|$|It was {{interesting}} to see the crowd's reaction to the English last-wicket partnership. They cheered every scoring shot and went into ecstasy over Tattersall's efforts.

500|$|Following {{the capture}} of Lord, the {{remaining}} prisoners agreed that 25 April would be {{the final day of}} the protest. Prison officers entered the prison early in the morning and gradually began to occupy the upper landings. At 10:20 <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the remaining prisoners, a seventeen-year-old on remand for joyriding, was captured leaving five prisoners remaining on the roof. When prison officers reached the roof they put up a sign similar to the ones used by prisoners throughout the protest, which read [...] "HMP in charge—no visits". At 6:20 pm the remaining five prisoners were removed from the roof in a [...] "cherry picker" [...] hydraulic platform, giving clenched fist salutes to the press and public as they descended. During the course of the 25-day riot, the longest in British penal history, 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners had been injured.|$|E
500|$|Band {{originally}} planned {{to produce a}} sequel called Laserblast II, with production work to begin in August 1986 and a theatrical release expected to follow shortly thereafter. A tagline released for the film read, [...] "The ultimate alien weapon is back." [...] When plans for the sequel were announced, Atlanta-based film critic Scott Journal wrote, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{few people in the}} world who saw the original and, believe me, it did not merit a followup." [...] However, Charles Band Productions fell into financial difficulties shortly after the production of Laserblast, and the project was eventually scrapped. However, the premise and elements of the abandoned sequel were later used in the 1988 Charles Band film, Deadly Weapon, which, like Laserblast, was about a bullied teenager who finds a powerful weapon and uses it to seek revenge against his enemies. Band continued to make films and eventually formed Empire Pictures.|$|E

500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that I <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him."
