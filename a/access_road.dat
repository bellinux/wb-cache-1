5|$|Friendship International Airport was {{constructed}} between 1947 and 1950 {{as the new}} primary airport for Baltimore. To directly connect the airport with Baltimore, an <b>access</b> <b>road</b> was planned to link the new BaltimoreWashington Expressway, later designated MD 295, with the airport terminal. The first portion of the Friendship International Airport <b>Access</b> <b>Road</b> was completed from a full Y interchange at the expressway to an interchange with MD 170 in October 1949 and designated MD 46. The <b>access</b> <b>road</b> was completed from MD 170 to the airport terminal in July 1951, {{about the same time}} the expressway was completed between MD 46 and downtown Baltimore. The remainder of what is now I-195 was planned as early as 1969, when the portion of Metropolitan Boulevard north of US 1 was placed under construction. The freeway opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I-95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern Selford Road overpass in August 1974. The freeway was extended to its present terminus at Rolling Road and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975. Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I-95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46 from when it opened. North of I-95, the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166. That segment of MD 46 was renumbered as an extension of MD 166 by 1981.|$|E

5|$|The federal government, which {{owned and}} {{operated}} Dulles Airport before Congress created the MWAA, built the Dulles <b>Access</b> <b>Road</b> in the 1960s to connect the airport to Washington by way of Interstate 66. As the <b>access</b> <b>road</b> was built, the government opted to reserve the median of the road for some form of rail transit, and the nearby West Falls Church station was designed so that the line could eventually be extended in this direction. The original 1968 Metrorail plan included an eventual extension to Dulles airport. In 1969, Senator William Spong of Virginia tried unsuccessfully to have the extension to Dulles be built {{as part of an}} early stage of the system rather than having it be built at some unspecified time in the future. A 1971 study of the feasibility of Metrorail running to Dulles estimated that 30,000 people would ride the extension each day.|$|E

5|$|When the Orange Line was {{originally}} constructed in 1977, foundations for the bridges {{to carry the}} Silver Line over I-66 to the median of the Dulles <b>Access</b> <b>Road</b> were built up to ground level.
