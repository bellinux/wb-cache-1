We found that large brick substrates had a lower water holding capacity than small brick (− 35 %), which led to decreased shoot growth (− 17 %) and increased root:shoot ratio (+ 16 %). Green waste compost increased shoot and root growth (+ 32 % and + 13 %) shoot nitrogen concentration and chlorophyll content (20 % and 57 %), and decreased root:shoot ratio (− 15 %) compared to bark. The addition of swell gel increased substrate water holding capacity (+ 24 %), which increased shoot growth (+ 8 %). Total evapotranspiration (a proxy for potential cooling) was increased by greater shoot biomass and substrate water holding capacity. Overall, this study provides one of the first quantitative assessments of the relative importance of commonly used green roof substrate components. It is clear that substrate composition should be considered carefully when designing green roofs, and substrate composition can be tailored for green roof service provision...|$|E

O capim-tanzânia (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzânia I) foi colhido aos 60 - 65 dias de crescimento e ensilado em silos experimentais de PVC adaptados com válvula tipo Bunsen, com capacidade {{individual}} de 8, 5 kg. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições, em esquema fatorial 3 × 5, composto de três tipos de silagens (testemunha, com 5 % de polpa cítrica e com capim pré-emurchecido) e cinco graus de compactação (400, 500, 600, 700 ou 900 kg/m³). O aumento da densidade reduziu o pH e o N-amoniacal, de modo que, em maiores densidades, o pH se manteve na faixa ideal. A inclusão de polpa cítrica e o pré-emurchecimento do capim reduziram as perdas por efluente e gás das silagens. Com o aumento da densidade, a quantidade de efluente aumentou na silagem testemunha e diminuiu nas silagens com polpa cítrica. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the effects of different compaction degrees, inclusion of <b>absorbent</b> <b>additive</b> and wilting on the chemical composition of tanzania grass silages. The experiment was conducted using tanzania grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzânia I) harvested at 60 - 65 days of growth. The forage was ensiled in experimental PVC silos fitted with Bunsen type valves, with capacity for about 4 and 8 kg each. The treatments consisted of three types of silages (control, 5 % of citric pulp and pre-wilted) with five compaction degrees (400, 500, 600, 700 and 900 kg/m³). The experimental design was random blocks, with four replicates. Citric pulp and pre-wilting increased the dry matter content of tanzania grass silages. The increased density resulted into decreases in the pH values and amoniacal-N contents; the greatest densities resulted in pH values within the ideal range. The presence of citric pulp and the pre-wilting practice reduce the losses by effluent and gas relative to the control. As the density increased, the amount of effluent increased in the control silage and decreased in silages with citric pulp...|$|E

40|$|Homo- and co-polymers of {{acrylamide}} (AAm) and {{acrylic acid}} (or acrylate salt) (AA) or methacrylic acid (MAA)) are important classes of water-soluble polymers {{due to their}} numerous applications in fields such as super <b>absorbents,</b> <b>additives</b> in cosmetics, membrane technology, waste-water treatment and oil field operations. These polymers are generally made by free radical polymerization. For copolymerization reactions it is extremely important to {{know the details of}} reaction kinetics in order to ascertain the kinetic effects of different reaction parameters, which ultimately dictate final copolymer composition, microstructure and properties. The reactivity ratios for copolymerization of AAm and AA {{have been shown to be}} dependent on pH and they also change with reaction solvent. The present experimental investigation has been performed to study the kinetics of copolymerization of these monomers in aqueous and alcoholic media by considering factors such as type of initiator and solvent, and pH, in order to determine how they affect the reactivity ratios of these monomers. Reactivity ratios were determined by non-linear least squares (NLLS) and the error-in-variables-model (EVM) techniques and full conversion range kinetic investigations were carried out to confirm these values...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} get the maximum desired product in a short {{duration}} of reaction period, the catalyst should be more efficient; with the aim of these requirements, novel “multi-site phase transfer catalysts” (multi-site PTC) have been developed which contain more than one catalytic active site per molecule. The concept of multi-sited phase transfer catalyst was introduced by Idoux et al. in which they have synthesized phosphonium and quaternary onium ions containing more than one active site per molecule [19]. The benefits of multi-site PTC are: enhance the rate of reaction with less time consumption and it transfers more number of active species from aqueous phase to organic phase during the reactions in contrast with single site—PTC. The reports on multi-site phase transfer catalyst aided radical polymerization of different alkyl methacrylates were gradually blooming in recent years [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. The acrylic esters especially methyl methacrylate (MMA) are commercially fascinating and significant functional monomer for the synthesis of acrylic resins and various polymers based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with tunable properties. PMMA has good mechanical strength, acceptable chemical resistance and extremely good weather resistance. Further, it has favorable processing properties, good thermoforming and can be modified with pigments, flame retardant and UV <b>absorbent</b> <b>additives</b> [27, 28]. PMMA has vast profound and diverse applications that influence our lives every day. Radical polymerization {{is one of the best}} processes for the synthesis of polymers and the few important merits of radical polymerization are: it can be applied to all vinyl monomers under mild reaction condition with a wide range of temperature, it is water tolerant and its cost is relatively low. A curiosity on free radical polymerization has been stimulated to a great extent by the impressive progress made in several methods such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), nitroxyl radical-mediated polymerization (NMP), and reversible addition fragmentation transfer polymerization (RAFT). These methods and approaches were successfully introduced into polymerization process by different research groups [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Polymerization of MMA was effectively performed in ATRP [34, 35], NMP [36] and RAFT [37, 38]. The growth of a new kinetic model for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) using novel catalyst and different methods at moderate temperature will be one of the major progresses in an industrial perspective.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBabcock Hitachi {{has been}} {{developing}} a new amine-based scrubbing technology for capturing {{carbon dioxide in the}} flue gas of coal-fired power plants. The development program includes testing of commercial and new combinations of <b>absorbents</b> and <b>additives.</b> More than thirty kinds of amines have been evaluated and characterized by both fundamental tests in the laboratory and slipstream pilot plant tests. The pilot plant tests of the CO 2 scrubbing system were conducted at a coal-fired power plant in co-operation with Tokyo Electric Power Company. Two thousand hours of continuous operation was achieved with more than 90 % CO 2 reduction on average during the entire operation. Energy consumption with the original absorbent blend was much less than that with typical MEA. Since then the CO 2 scrubbing system has been further advanced to reduce the energy consumption as well as absorbent degradation drastically by improving the amine-based absorbent in a bench-scale test facility. Pilot tests at Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), University of North Dakota, were conducted in 2010 and the test results indicated high performance of the improved amine-based absorbent, H 3 - 1. This latest advanced solvent is also scheduled to be demonstrated in a large mobile test facility at several coal-fired power plants in Europe starting 2010. In parallel, conceptual designs of the CO 2 scrubbing system for commercial plants up to 800  MWe in size are being developed...|$|R
