5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and {{for the same reasons}} as anthropoids.|$|E
5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out {{the center of the}} log <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of the}} lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Rake and scrape== Rake <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> {{music is}} played {{traditionally}} with Concertinas, Goombay drums, and a Handsaw. Rake <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> {{is believed to}} have originated on the island of Cat Island but evidence suggest that it was emerging in many places simultaneously. The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.|$|R

25|$|In his 1637 book Dioptrique French philosopher, {{mathematician}} and scientist René Descartes suggested placing an eye of {{a recently}} dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the {{eye of a}}n ox) into an opening in a darkened room <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.|$|E

25|$|One {{of their}} {{trademarks}} {{is the use}} of custom-built instruments, predominantly made out of scrap metal and building tools, and noises, in addition to standard musical instruments. Their early albums were unremittingly harsh, with Bargeld's vocals shouted and screamed above a din of banging <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> metal percussion. Subsequent recordings found the group's sound growing somewhat more conventional, yet still containing many unorthodox elements.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} and not sharing personal items. While treatment {{is not necessary}} some may wish to have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons or to prevent spread. Removal may occur with freezing, opening up the lesion <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> the inside, or laser therapy. Scraping the lesion can however result in scarring. The medication cimetidine by mouth or podophyllotoxin cream applied to the skin may also be used.|$|E
25|$|Excavation of {{this site}} has {{resulted}} in the discovery of four layers of stratigraphy. Level I has produced evidence for eighth to third centuries BC use by Phoenicians. Below that, level II produced evidence for brief Neolithic use. Level III has yielded at least 240 Upper Paleolithic artefacts of Magdalenian and Solutrean origin. Level IV has produced 103 items, including spear-points, knives, <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> devices that are identified as Mousterian, and shows repeated use over thousands of years.|$|E

25|$|Thus, the {{specialised}} cornified {{structures of}} the hoof are the wall, the sole, the frog and periople. The wall does not exfoliate at all; it is constantly growing downward (about 1cm per month), and self-trims by wearing or chipping by ground contact, in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by ground contact and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and typical ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, trimming {{the walls and the}} frog, <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> off the dead sole.|$|E
25|$|By midnight all was quiet, but {{the ship}} was still labouring to rejoin {{the main part of}} the convoy. Steaming on slowly, Saturday turned into Sunday. Sunday 26 October would be a day that the crew of the English Trader would never forget. Between 1 am and 1.30 am, {{the ship was}} {{struggling}} against a strong ebbing tide, which in turn forced her dangerously close to the sandbanks of Hammond Knoll. At around 1.45 am the crew felt a slight jolt followed by a more severe jolt. This flung the ship forward followed by loud grinding, crunching <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> of metal. Then there was silence. The ship had run aground on Hammond Knoll.|$|E
25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.|$|E

5000|$|Quote from Smithsonian Folkways {{recordings}} on {{the origin}} of Rake <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> music in the Bahamas states [...] "The rake <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> band hails back to the 1800s, when the Africans who were brought to the Bahamas looked to make music on whatever was available to them: a carpenter's saw, pork barrels with goat or sheep skin to make a drum, and the accordion which might have been a gift from their colonial master." ...|$|R

25|$|Lead may be {{introduced}} into glass either as an ingredient {{of the primary}} melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained {{from a variety of}} sources. In Europe, galena, lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be calcined to form lead oxide by roasting it <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> off the litharge. In the medieval period lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver cupellation, and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.|$|E
25|$|Osteochondrosis is a {{disturbance}} {{in the normal}} development of cartilage; cartilage becomes abnormally thickened, and small fissures and cracks may develop. Dissecans is when cartilage becomes dissected resulting in cartilage flaps, which may remain attached or become loose and fall into the joint space. In Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs most of these cases occur in the shoulder joints and occasionally in elbows and hocks. Except for very mild cases without flap development, the clinical signs are persistent or intermittent lameness. The dog may be stiff after resting and the lameness is usually aggravated by exercise. It is diagnosed by x-rays, and treatment depends on {{the severity of the}} case. Mild cases without cartilage flaps may be treated and heal with several weeks of rest and treatment with medication and supplements. Many cases require surgery to remove the flaps and loose fragments, <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> and smoothing of the defective surface. Surgical repair of the shoulder usually has excellent results, surgical results involving other sites are not as predictable.|$|E
500|$|Ottavio, {{shown as}} tall and muscular, {{is about to}} kneel to kiss the Pope's feet, a {{contemporary}} manner of greeting a pope: a guest would make three short bows followed by the kissing of the papal feet. Titian indicates this step in the ceremony by showing Paul's shoe decorated with a cross, poking from underneath his gown. Ottavio's head is bowed, but his stern facial expression conveys that he is acting as protocol dictates, rather than with genuine diffidence. [...] Nicholas Penny notes that [...] "... at a Renaissance court bowing <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> were usual. This affects modern attitudes to , making the cordial respect of youth seem like the obsequiousness of a crafty courtier." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{very small}} {{percentage}} of people choose a 'visible' operation where De Faria operates without traditional anesthetic. Instead he says he uses [...] "energized" [...] mineral water and the spiritual energies present, the latter which are provided by groups of volunteers who meditate in a separate room called the 'current room'. These practices such as inserting scissors or forceps deep into a nose <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> an eye without an anesthetic or antiseptics have been scrutinized by medical authorities and skeptical investigators James Randi, who has called for De Faria to come clean and stop lying to the public about the existence of spirit and Joe Nickell have described these procedures at length as old carnival tricks.|$|E

At first, Columbia Records tried to downplay Tucker's age, but soon word leaked out and she became a sensation. A year later, Australian singer Helen Reddy scored a number-one U.S. pop hit with her version of [...] "Delta Dawn".|$|E
2500|$|Instruments {{were also}} created by Seattle musician/instrument {{designer}} Ela Lamblin. These included a Stamenphone ("a sort of {{cross between a}} waterphone and a tambura that can be bowed to create droning tonal melodies or struck for a percussive metallic resonating sound") and Orbacles ("hollow metal pods large enough to fit a person inside. These could be struck to create percussive impacts, bowed with superballs to create moaning ambiences and played like congas to create rhythms"). These were combined with other objects such as hubcaps, railroad spikes, hammers and glass jars. Metal rods [...] "were about 8-10 feet long and were played by rubbing rosin-coated gloves lengthwise along the rods. These created otherworldly drones that were later put into a sampler, pitched {{up and down and}} layered to create ambiences. The rods were also struck to create violent shrieks and metallic percussive sounds." [...] A mounted bicycle wheel [...] "was played by cranking the wheel <b>and</b> <b>scraping</b> different objects across the spokes." ...|$|E
