5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore {{responsibility}}—both in terms of <b>accountability</b> <b>in</b> Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote <b>accountability</b> <b>in</b> the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of American {{intervention in the}} Middle East, Lynch has made twelve trips to Iraq {{and a total of}} ten trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Part of the purpose of these visits was to ensure <b>accountability</b> <b>in</b> reconstruction projects. He voted for the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war. He has since supported Obama's drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011. He also supports Obama's renewal of the War in Afghanistan, and was the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama's Afghanistan initiative. Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, but along with Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, he pushed for strict oversight of the aid's distribution.|$|E

To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing international organisations, e.g. the United Nations, as well as the creation of new institutions such as a World Parliament, which ideally would enhance public control over, and <b>accountability</b> <b>in,</b> international politics.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan {{has been}} run by {{military}} dictatorships for large periods of time, alternating with limited democracy.
