5|$|In 1913, Edison {{introduced}} a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen.

However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after {{little more than a}} year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, The Photo-Drama of Creation, promoting Jehovah's Witnesses' conception of mankind's genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.|$|E

Cotton was grown extensively {{to meet the requirements}} of cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products.

While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, neither does the next down-stream dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility of added fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second large dam down-stream, Rocky Reach Dam, does contains <b>an</b> <b>intricate</b> system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning.
