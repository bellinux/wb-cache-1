5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, an {{extensive}} canal system had been constructed, giving {{greater access to}} natural resources and fuel for industries. During the Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England. Birmingham was granted city status in 1889 by Queen Victoria. Joseph Chamberlain, mayor of Birmingham and later an MP, and his son Neville Chamberlain, who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister, <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most well-known political figures who have lived in Birmingham. The city established its own university in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Canberra {{has many}} venues for live music and theatre: the Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions; and Llewellyn Hall (within the ANU School of Music), a {{world-class}} concert hall <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most notable.

5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is {{the most widely used}} message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E
5|$|Cricket and {{football}} {{are the two}} most popular sports in Dhaka and across the nation. Teams are fielded in intra-city and national competitions by many schools, colleges and private entities. The Mohammedan Sporting Club and Abahani <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most famous football and cricket teams, maintaining a fierce rivalry, especially in the Bangladesh Football Premier League.

East-west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names except between State Street and Michigan Avenue. There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street. Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers. Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered. Cullerton St (20th Street) & Cermak Road (22nd Street) <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few named east-west cross streets. Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile.|$|E
5|$|Like Highway401, {{a portion}} of the route is divided into a collector-express system with twelve to {{fourteen}} continuous lanes. Notable about Highway427 are its several multi-level interchanges; the junctions with QEW and Highway401 <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971, while the interchanges with Highway409 and Highway407 are more recent and were completed in 1992 and 1995, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool and Newcastle United <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest {{clubs in}} English football. Despite not having won a major honour since 1969, the Tyneside club is {{recognised}} for its passionate and loyal fanbase—over the course of 53 out of 63 seasons between 1946–47 and 2009–10, more people attended Newcastle home matches, on average, than home games played by the league champions. During the 1970s and 1980s, Liverpool became the most successful club in England, amassing 11 league championships in a 17-year period.

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{the growth of}} Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has {{transformed}} the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy {{is dominated by the}} service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which the forestry and petroleum industries <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most prominent components.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Grand Forks is not {{dominated}} by any one industry or sector.

The state and federal governments <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The University of North Dakota, in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area. Grand Forks Air Force Base, just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its military personnel. Altru Health System is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E

The barn, a building of high historical significance, was not included as part of the National Register listing for the property until 2002, nearly 30 years after the original nomination was approved.|$|E

A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when time expires, which causes the round to end in sudden death.|$|E
