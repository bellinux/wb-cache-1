However, the paper went out of print in January 1911. It was reestablished as a bi-monthly on November 1, and again ceased publication in December. It was restored <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final time in June 1912, but went out of business soon after.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ever}} LaserDisc title marketed in North America was the MCA DiscoVision release of Jaws in 1978. A second LaserDisc was {{released}} in 1992, before <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final version came out under MCA/Universal Home Video's Signature Collection imprint in 1995. This release was an elaborate boxset that included deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on {{the making of the}} film directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, a copy of the novel Jaws, and a CD of John Williams's soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|After an {{hour and}} a half had gone (and twenty minutes had passed since the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E

While a C major seventh chord would have <b>a</b> major <b>third</b> <b>and</b> major seventh, Csup7 would contain <b>a</b> supermajor <b>third</b> (E) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> supermajor seventh (B).

5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is that {{they appear to have}} been preferentially recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|Another refit {{followed}} on 12 December 1925– 11 July 1927. The {{elevation of}} the main battery guns was again increased, the bow section of the belt armor was removed, and half of her boilers were converted to oil-firing models. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Indret oil-fired boilers, new turbines and main battery guns were installed, along with eight new 75mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, <b>a</b> <b>third,</b> <b>and</b> a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured, enemies would look like a person pretending to be a lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> gorier one.|$|E

His role as a Kodokan competitor was specially notable in the second police tournament against the Yōshin-ryū school, in 1886. He fought Enchi Kotaro, knocking him out with a hard ippon seoi nage. Later, in 1888, he fought in <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> last police tournament, in which he defeated Yōshin-ryū leader Terushima Taro.|$|E

His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby {{as evidence of}} great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E
5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E

5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1951, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in {{the bottom half of}} the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.|$|E

Abby quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm {{only a few hours}} later over land. While Abby approached the border of Guatemala and Mexico, it had weakened further to a tropical depression. Abby dissipated while situated over the Mexican state of Tabasco on July 16. The remnants crossed over Mexico into the Pacific Ocean and regenerated into Hurricane Celeste on July 20. Hurricane Celeste lasted for two days in the Pacific before it dissipated on July 22.|$|E

There was some difficulty in getting permission for Judy to travel, and it was feared that she and Williams would be split up. This issue was promoted in the Evening Standard, and after the involvement of William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme, permission was given for Judy to travel with Williams. She had <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final litter of puppies during her time in Africa. After two years there, Judy was discovered to have a mammary tumour; an operation removed the growth, but a tetanus infection soon set in, and she was euthanized on 17 February 1950 at the age of nearly 14. She was buried in her RAF jacket, with her campaign medals, the Pacific Star, the 1939–1945 Star, and the Defence Medal. Frank spent two months building a granite and marble memorial in her memory, which included a plaque that told of her life story.|$|E
