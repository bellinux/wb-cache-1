5|$|On March 9, 1842, Francisco Lopez, {{the uncle}} of Antonio's second wife, Jacoba Feliz, took a rest under {{an oak tree}} in Placerita Canyon and had <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>that</b> he was {{floating}} on a pool of gold. When he awoke, he pulled a few wild onions from the ground finding flakes of gold in the roots. Contrary to some portraits {{of him as a}} farmer who stumbled upon his discovery by dumb luck, Lopez had studied mineralogy at the University of Mexico and had been actively searching for gold. Evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area about thirty years prior, but the Lopez gold find was the first popularly documented incident in the area. This sparked a gold rush on a much smaller scale than the 1849 California Gold Rush. About 2,000 people, mostly from the Mexican state of Sonora, came to Rancho San Francisco to mine the gold.|$|E

25|$|According to the texts, a {{merchant}} 500 yearsa ago named Manga Oswal from Nagarparkar {{had gone to}} Pattan to purchase some items. He was informed in <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>that</b> an image was buried under {{the house of a}} local Muslim that Oswal was instructed to acquire. Oswal bought the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka), and was instructed in another dream to place the image on a cart and to move forward without looking back. The cart is said to have broken down near Nagarparkar, where Oswal then fell asleep. In his next dream, he was informed that underneath him lay marble and treasure, and instructed him to recruit craftsmen to build a fine temple in which to worship the idol, which was bestowed with the name Gori. The temple's construction was supervised by an architect from Sirohi, while the shikhar of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The image was formally reconsecrated by Acharya Merutunga Suri of Anchala Gachchha, thus establishing the Gori Parshvanth Tirth, and the temple as a place of pilgrimage for Jains from afar.|$|E
