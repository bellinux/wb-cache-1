25|$|In {{addition}} to combustion, many polymerization reactions involve free radicals. As a result, many plastics, enamels, and other polymers are formed through radical polymerization. For instance, drying oils and <b>alkyd</b> paints harden due to radical crosslinking by oxygen from the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Thermal {{decomposition}} kinetics {{of three}} palm oleic acid-based <b>alkyds</b> with different oil lengths and having different molecular weights were studied using TGA measurements under non-isothermal conditions. Activation energies {{were obtained from}} Kissinger and Ozawa, Flynn and Wall (OFW) methods and subsequently the pre-exponential factor, A, degradation rate constant, k, for all the <b>alkyds</b> were also determined. From kinetic analysis of the thermal decomposition using the OFW method, {{it was found that}} degradation of all the <b>alkyds</b> has taken place in more than two stages, corresponding to different mechanisms. As shown from Ozawa and Kis-singer methods, the chemical composition of the <b>alkyds</b> influenced the thermal degradation; increasing the phthalic anhydride and glycerol, and decreasing the oleic acid increased the thermal stabilities of the <b>alkyds...</b>|$|R

25|$|Coatings. Clear {{coatings}} {{preserve the}} natural color, warmth and metallic tone of copper alloys. However, particularly on exterior applications, they introduce maintenance {{into what is}} naturally a maintenance-free material. They are organic chemicals that are dry at ambient temperatures or require heat for curing or solvent evaporation.

2500|$|The Getty Conservation Institute also {{provides}} information surrounding their {{case study on}} [...] It addresses the modern paints (e.g. [...] "synthetic binders—most notably acrylic, <b>alkyd,</b> polyvinyl acetate, and nitrocellulose") {{that could be used}} in the contemporary versions of panel paintings compared to 15th Century Oil Paints and the continued studies in the evolution of paints.|$|E
2500|$|Pollock {{started using}} {{synthetic}} resin-based paints called <b>alkyd</b> enamels, which {{at that time}} was a novel medium. Pollock described this use of household paints, instead of artist’s paints, as [...] "a natural growth out of a need". He used hardened brushes, sticks, and even basting syringes as paint applicators. Pollock's technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought {{to be one of the}} origins of the term action painting. With this technique, Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art, the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas. By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{more than}} one third of {{recycled}} PET was used as polyesters for the textile industry. Roughly one quarter of recycled PET was processed to <b>alkyds,</b> that is, synthetic resins which are mostly used as varnish, while packaging accounted for 18% of recycled PET.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the {{stimulus}} of World War II created a shortage of linseed oil in the supply market that artificial resins, or <b>alkyds,</b> were invented. Cheap and easy to make, they also held the color well and lasted for a long time.|$|R
50|$|Low-odor, isoparaffinic solvent, in {{addition}} to being lower in odor than solvents typically used in solvent-based systems, also has a higher margin of safety versus stronger solvents. The following discussion on Air Change Index (ACI) illustrates that less air turnover is needed when using low-odor, isoparaffinic solvent in comparison to other solvent-based systems such as <b>alkyds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|With the {{likelihood}} of the United States entering the war, and after experiments with various paint schemes conducted in association with the 1940 Fleet Problem (exercise), the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) directed in January 1941 that the peacetime color of overall #5 Standard Navy Gray, a light gloss shade with a linseed-oil base, be replaced with matte Dark Gray, #5-D, a new paint formulation with a synthetic <b>alkyd</b> resin base. [...] Rather than waste the large quantities of Standard Gray already in inventory and aboard ships, BuShips directed the issuance of a black tinting paste (5-BP) which when mixed in stated proportions with Standard Gray would yield a close approximation of 5-D, with issue of the new paint in pre-mixed form to follow. BuShips also issued Ship Camouflage Instructions (SHIPS-2), laying out 9 painting schemes to be used throughout the Navy. Rather than issue premixed quantities of the less-used new shades, Light Gray (5-L) and Ocean Gray (5-O), yards and supply depots were directed to issue an untinted base paint (5-U) together with a blue-black tinting material (5-TM) which when mixed according to instructions would turn 5-U into either Light or Ocean Gray.|$|E

40|$|A one-pot, enzyme-catalyzed bulk {{polymerization}} method for direct production of highly branched polyesters {{has been developed}} {{as an alternative to}} currently used industrial procedures. Bio-based feed components in the form of glycerol, pentaerythritol, azelaic acid, and tall oil fatty acid (TOFA) were polymerized using an immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and the potential for an enzymatic synthesis of <b>alkyds</b> was investigated. The developed method enables the use of both glycerol and also pentaerythritol (for the first time) as the alcohol source and was found to be very robust. This allows simple variations in the molar mass and structure of the polyester without premature gelation, thus enabling easy tailoring of the branched polyester structure. The postpolymerization crosslinking of the polyesters illustrates their potential as binders in <b>alkyds.</b> The formed films had good UV stability, very high water contact angles of up to 141 ° and a glass transition temperature that could be controlled through the feed composition...|$|R
50|$|Rust-Oleum is a {{manufacturer}} of protective paints and coatings for home and industrial use. It was founded in 1921 by Robert Fergusson (a sea captain, not the famous poet) after he noticed that raw fish oil spilled on rusty metal decks stopped corrosion from spreading. He soon incorporated whale oil into the formula, although many changes have been made over the years. Rust-Oleum products no longer contain whale oil, instead using resins derived from <b>Alkyds,</b> polyurethanes, epoxys, latex, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike drying {{oils and}} <b>alkyds</b> which cure, after {{evaporation}} of the solvent, upon reaction with oxygen from the air, true polyurethane coatings cure, after evaporation of the solvent, {{by a variety}} of reactions of chemicals within the original mix, or by reaction with moisture from the air. Certain polyurethane products are [...] "hybrids" [...] and combine different aspects of their parent components. [...] "Oil-modified" [...] polyurethanes, whether water-borne or solvent-borne, are currently the most widely used wood floor finishes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alkyd</b> or oil-urethane binders {{are used}} in metalcasting for the {{creation}} of sand-based moulds. The <b>alkyd</b> resin is mixed with a polymeric isocyanate and a metallic drier, which speeds the reaction.

5000|$|An <b>alkyd</b> is a {{polyester}} {{modified by}} the addition of fatty acids and other components. They are derived from polyols and a dicarboxylic acid or carboxylic acid anhydride. The term <b>alkyd</b> is a modification of the original name [...] "alcid", reflecting {{the fact that they are}} derived from alcohol and organic acids. The inclusion of the fatty acid confers a tendency to form flexible coating. Alkyds are used in paints and in moulds for casting. They are the dominant resin or [...] "binder" [...] in most commercial [...] "oil-based" [...] coatings. Approximately 200,000 tons of <b>alkyd</b> resins are produced each year. The original alkyds were compounds of glycerol and phthalic acid sold under the name Glyptal. These were sold as substitutes for the darker colored Copal resins, thus creating <b>alkyd</b> varnishes which were much paler in colour. From these, the alkyds we know today were developed.|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} other sources of {{microplastics}} in the environment have been identified. Abrasion from car tyres has been considered as very relevant [46, 57]. In addition, many ship paints and other protective paints contain synthetic polymers, e.g. <b>alkyds,</b> poly(acrylate/styrene), PU and epoxy resins. Microplastics may be released by spills during application of the paint, by abrasion during use of the painted product and during paint removal [21, 57]. Microplastics are also released {{as a consequence of}} abrasion from other plastic materials such as household plastics [31, 57].|$|R
50|$|Pyrolysis gas {{chromatography}} {{is useful for}} the identification of involatile compounds and synthetic polymeric media, such as acrylics or <b>alkyds,</b> and synthetic varnishes.
