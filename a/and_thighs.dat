5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms <b>and</b> <b>thighs),</b> 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin <b>and</b> <b>thighs.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen <b>and</b> <b>thighs</b> were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back <b>and</b> <b>thighs,</b> giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest <b>and</b> <b>thighs</b> can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the nutritional value and some functional properties of ostrich and camel meat proteins. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) were noted in the proximate composition (except ash) of loin <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> cuts of both means. Loin <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> cuts of camel meat and higher moisture and fat, but lower protein compared to the loin <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> cuts of ostrich meat. Essential amino acids except isoleusine, phenylalanine and tryptophan were significantly higher in loin cuts of camel meat than that in ostrich meat. Similarly, the thigh cuts of camel meat had higher amounts of essential amino acids except tryptophan compared to ostrich meat. The protein nutritional value determined by the calculated protein efficiency ratio (C-PER) for ostrich meat cuts was lower (1. 05 and 1. 23 for loin <b>and</b> <b>thigh,</b> respectively) than that of camel cuts (21. 5 and 2. 13 respectively).

The seven cooked chicken measurements were breast <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> mois-ture <b>and</b> fat content, carcass cooking loss, and breast muscle <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> skin shear test. There were no sex differences in any measurements, and temperature only affected fat content of breast mus-cle causing {{an increase in the}} hot room. Significant phenotype differences were evident in all traits except moisture content. Scaleless birds had less fat in both breast (56. 8 %) <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> muscle (19. 2 %), reduced cooking losses (17. 5 %), and were more tender in both breast muscle (52. 4 %) <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> skin (60. 9 %). A paired comparison preference test was used for organoleptic measurements using a taste panel of 35 tasters. A significant portion of the tasters were able to perceive a difference in both breast (100 %) <b>and</b> <b>thigh</b> (85. 7 %) muscle. No significant differences were noted for moistness, texture or flavorfulness of thigh muscle however, but a significant 74. 3 % felt that breast muscle from scaleless broilers was more moist and 71. 4 % felt it had a smoother texture.
