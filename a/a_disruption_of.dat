The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E

The scars that give the name to the condition are produced by the astrocyte cells healing old lesions.|$|E
25|$|The second Shah king, {{who ruled}} from Kathmandu, Pratap Singh Shah, {{supplied}} alloyed silver coins {{during the period}} 1775 until 1777. Thereafter, when the Nepalese again tried to introduce into Tibet coins of good silver, which should have circulated at a considerable premium compared with the Malla and Pratap Simha coins, the Tibetans refused which resulted in <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> trade between Nepal and Tibet. Tibet again experimented with its own coinage in 1785, in order to mitigate the shortage of silver coins.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the high}} levels of anxiety seen in IBS {{patients}} and the overlap with conditions such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, a potential model of IBS involves <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the stress system. The stress response in the body involves the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, both of which have been shown to operate abnormally in IBS patients. Psychiatric illness or anxiety precedes IBS symptoms in two-thirds of patients, and psychological traits predispose previously healthy people to developing IBS after gastroenteritis.|$|E
25|$|Oceanic {{overturn}} is <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> thermo-haline circulation {{which lets}} surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep {{water to the}} surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a glaciation, although an overturn {{at the start of a}} glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.|$|E
25|$|Many renters {{retained}} {{ties to the}} estates, diversifying their household's {{sources of}} income and level of economic security. In San Luis Potosí, rentals were fewer and estate employment the norm. After {{a number of years}} of drought and bad harvests {{in the first decade of}} the nineteenth century Hidalgo's 1810 grito appealed more in the Bajío than in San Luis Potosí. In the Bajío estate owners were evicting tenants in favor of renters better able to pay more for land, there was <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> previous patterns of mutual benefit between estate owners and renters.|$|E

25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{indicated}} keratoconic corneas show signs of increased activity by proteases, a class of enzymes that break some of the collagen cross-linkages in the stroma, with a simultaneous reduced expression of protease inhibitors. Other studies have suggested that reduced activity by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase may be responsible for a build-up of free radicals and oxidising species in the cornea. Whatever the pathogenetical process, the damage caused by activity within the cornea likely results in a reduction in its thickness and biomechanical strength. At an ultrastructural level the weakening of the corneal tissue is associated with <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the regular arrangement of the collagen layers and collagen fibril orientation. While keratoconus is considered a noninflammatory disorder, one study shows wearing rigid contact lenses by people leads to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in the tear fluid.|$|E
25|$|Bolstered {{by the new}} German arrivals, the Finnish III Corps {{launched}} its final offensive on 30 October. The Soviets had increased their defenses and had moved in additional units from other locations. Nevertheless, Finnish forces took some ground and encircled an entire Soviet regiment. Suddenly on 17 November the Finnish command ordered {{an end to the}} offensive despite positive feedback from the field commanders that further ground could be taken. The reason for this sudden change in Finnish behavior was the result of diplomatic pressure by the United States. Prior to the cancellation of the offensive, US diplomats warned Finland that <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> US deliveries to the Soviet Union would have serious consequences for Finland. Therefore, Finland became no longer interested in spearheading the offensive. With the Finnish refusal {{to be involved in the}} offensive, Arctic Fox came to an end in November and both sides dug in at their current positions.|$|E

25|$|The Kunbi Hindre (or Hendre) are {{synonymous with}} the Hindre Patils, {{as far as their}} {{perceived}} distribution in the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra in the districts of Nanded, Parbhani, Yeotmal and Akola is concerned. There are no further subdivisions of the community. The community is said to have migrated from the Sahyadri ranges to the central Vidharbha region. The community does not have an oral tradition concerning the etymology of the word Hindre or the history of their migration, so their own origin is unknown to them. While the Hindre were grouped with the Kunbis of the Khandesh region in early ethnographical studies, the origin of the community is not known. Their population has not been accurately recorded in any official records; since the community is only found in certain rural districts, the Anthropological Survey of India estimates their population to be in thousands or in lakhs. While the traditional occupation of the Hindre Kunbis is agriculture, better educational opportunities and urbanisation have resulted in <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> their traditional economy, which has caused many Hindre to pursue diversified occupations.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the confounding influence of external factors, patients undergoing infrared thermographic testing must conform to special restrictions {{regarding the use}} of certain vasoconstrictors (namely, nicotine and caffeine), skin lotions, physical therapy, and other diagnostic procedures in the days prior to testing. Patients may also be required to discontinue certain pain medications and sympathetic blockers. After a patient arrives at a thermographic laboratory, he or she is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in a 16–20°C, draft-free, steady-state room wearing a loose fitting cotton hospital gown for approximately twenty minutes. A technician then takes infrared images of both the patient's affected and unaffected limbs, as well as reference images of other parts of the patient's body, including his or her face, upper back, and lower back. After capturing a set of baseline images, some labs further require the patient to undergo cold-water autonomic-functional-stress-testing to evaluate the function of his or her autonomic nervous system's peripheral vasoconstrictor reflex. This is performed by placing a patient's unaffected limb in a cold water bath (approximately 20°C) for five minutes while collecting images. In a normal, intact, functioning autonomic nervous system, a patient's affected extremity will become colder. Conversely, warming of an affected extremity may indicate <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the body's normal thermoregulatory vasoconstrictor function, which may sometimes indicate underlying CRPS.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} {{of blood vessels}} requires the coordination of endothelial and supportive mesenchymal cells through multiple phases to develop the intricate networks required for a fully functional circulatory system. The dynamic nature and expression patterns of the Ephs make them, therefore, ideal for roles in angiogenesis. Mouse embryonic models show expression of EphA1 in mesoderm and pre-endocardial cells, later spreading up into the dorsal aorta then primary head vein, intersomitic vessels, and limb bud vasculature, as {{would be consistent with}} a role in angiogenesis. Different class A Eph receptors have also been detected in the lining of the aorta, brachial arch arteries, umbilical vein, and endocardium. Complementary expression of EphB2/ephrin-B4 was detected in developing arterial endothelial cells and EphB4 in venous endothelial cells. Expression of EphB2 and ephrin-B2 was also detected on supportive mesenchymal cells, suggesting a role in wall development through mediation of endothelial-mesenchymal interactions. Blood vessel formation during embryogenesis consists of vasculogenesis, the formation of a primary capillary network followed by a second remodeling and restructuring into a finer tertiary network - studies utilizing ephrin-B2 deficient mice showed <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the embryonic vasculature {{as a result of a}} deficiency in the restructuring of the primary network. Functional analysis of other mutant mice have led to the development of a hypothesis by which Ephs and ephrins contribute to vascular development by restricting arterial and venous endothelial mixing, thus stimulating the production of capillary sprouts as well as in the differentiation of mesenchyme into perivascular support cells, an ongoing area of research.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{decreased}} calcium influx, [...] <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> active zone vesicle release sites also occurs, which {{may also be}} antibody-dependent, since people with LEMS have antibodies to components of these active zones (including voltage-dependent calcium channels). Together, these abnormalities lead to the decrease in muscle contractility. Repeated stimuli {{over a period of}} about 10 seconds eventually lead to sufficient delivery of calcium, and an increase in muscle contraction to normal levels, which can be demonstrated using an electrodiagnostic medicine study called needle electromyography by increasing amplitude of repeated compound muscle action potentials.|$|E

The most commonly seen in the series is the simple creation of s [...] causing the targeted person(s) to hear, see, smell, taste, or feel sensations that are not actually there in order to manipulate them. Most genjutsu affects the five senses, though other applications of genjutsu exist. Those {{under the influence of}} genjutsu usually freeze in place or lose consciousness, depending on how capable they are in recognizing and defending against it. Depending on the purpose of the genjutsu, one could be running or jumping while under the genjutsu (as seen when Itachi uses genjutsu on Naruto in Part II, when he used the Rasengan on Itachi, only to find out it had been genjutsu and he had used it on air). A genjutsu can be broken in one of three ways. The first is , <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the victim's chakra flow either by themselves or their allies. Pain that is not a result of the genjutsu, such as stabbing oneself, is a second method of countering genjutsu.
