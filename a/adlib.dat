25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. But I {{think the}} {{national}} show will improve {{in the next few}} weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in the national show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just <b>adlib.</b>|$|E
25|$|Valerie Arem of PCB Productions was {{the voice}} {{director}} for dubbing. Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately. Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as a positive experience, reinforced {{by the fact that}} they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting. Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff. In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to <b>adlib</b> parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances. For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.|$|E
500|$|The package {{illustration}} for Fate of Atlantis {{was inspired}} by the Indiana Jones movie posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack for the game, arranging John Williams' main theme [...] "The Raiders March" [...] for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an <b>AdLib</b> or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on Barwood's and Falstein's story, then titled Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team {{trying to come up with}} a better title than Fate of Atlantis, though the staff members could never think of one and always ended up with names such as [...] "Indiana Jones Does Atlantis". The final title was Barwood's idea, who first had to convince the company's management and the marketing team not to simply call the game [...] "Indy's Next Adventure".|$|E
50|$|This song {{is one of}} {{the tracks}} that {{features}} Raven-Symoné on lead. Symoné has two verses, {{one of them is a}} rap verse. Main <b>adlibs</b> by Adrienne Bailon and additional <b>adlibs</b> by Symoné. Both Sabrina Bryan and Kiely Williams sings the title on the chorus. Since Symoné did not participate on the girls' touring activities, Bryan took Symoné's rap verse. Williams then sings the main parts of the song with Bailon. Main <b>adlibs</b> and Symoné's are sung by Bailon.|$|R

2500|$|Catherine was {{developed}} by the same team behind the Persona series, beginning production on the game alongside polishing for [...] in 2008. Multiple staff from the Persona series were involved; Katsura Hashino produced and directed, Shigenori Soejima was art director and character designer, and the music was composed by a team led by Shoji Meguro. The aim was to create something different from the Persona series aimed at an adult audience. The localization was handled by Atlus USA, with the English actors being allowed to <b>adlib</b> some lines. Reception was generally positive, with critics praising its mature subject matter and gameplay, despite criticism being directed towards its high difficulty. Several journalists have also commented on its representation of gender stereotypes. Having sold 500,000 units worldwide by the end of 2011, it exceeded sales expectations.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Domingo starred on the poorly {{acclaimed}} sequel of Kimmy Dora, subtitled as Kimmy Dora and The Temple of Kiyeme shot in Philippines and South Korea. She also starred on {{the first}} ever Filipino musical film entitled, [...] produced by Unitel in partnership with Studio 5. It {{is a tribute to}} APO Hiking Society, and received positive reviews from critics. She also hosted a game show under GMA Network, Celebrity Bluff with comic duo, Jose Manalo and Wally Bayola. Domingo also stars on theater through Bona, produced by the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA). She was a call center agent obsessed with actor-wannabe Edgar Allan Guzman. [...] She was nominated as [...] "Best Actress in a Play award" [...] for her role at the International Theater Award. She was also hailed as [...] "Best Actress" [...] for Bona at the 25th Aliw Awards in 2012. According to Gibz Cadiz of Philippine Daily Inquirer, Domingo is a tremendous actress, her theater background coming to the fore in her command of space, the way she deploys her vocal instrument, her ability to think on her feet (her every <b>adlib</b> is a hit with the audience).|$|E
2500|$|LeChuck's Revenge was {{the first}} title to use Michael Land's and Peter McConnell's iMUSE audio {{sequencing}} MIDI engine that enabled the compositions in the game to change interactively depending on the current environment or situation. Its capabilities are extensively explored in the game, with progressive music arrangements adapting to the story on screen {{for most of the}} game, and with logical transitions from one piece to another. For instance, the first town of Woodtick has its own theme, but every location or character the player visits within the town will produce seamless variations on the town theme, introducing new melodies, instruments, or changing the arrangement of the piece completely. [...] The DOS version uses a variation on the MIDI system, played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an <b>AdLib</b> or Sound Blaster sound card, or any other soundbank of an external, MIDI-compatible source, such as that of a Roland MT-32 sound module popular at the time. It's important to note that all MIDI files used by the game were recordings of hand-played performances over a MIDI controller, adding to the lively feeling of the soundtrack.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, Ad Lib {{filed for}} {{bankruptcy}} while the Sound Blaster family continued to dominate the PC gaming industry. That same year, Binnenalster GmbH purchased the assets of Ad Lib from the Government of Quebec, who had acquired them to prevent Creative Labs from buying them.

5000|$|Three {{different}} soundtracks {{were available}} for the game, depending on the user's sound card. The Sound Blaster soundtrack was composed of a mix of FM synthesis sounds and digital samples. This particular method of music creation and playback was unique to the Renaissance demogroup. The <b>AdLib</b> soundtrack consisted solely of FM synthesis sounds, due to most <b>AdLib</b> sound cards being incapable of playing digital audio. Some songs in the <b>AdLib</b> soundtrack were arrangements {{of those in the}} Sound Blaster soundtrack, while others are completely different songs altogether., ...|$|E
50|$|A third, {{separately}} downloadable soundtrack {{was available}} for owners of the Gravis Ultrasound sound card featuring high quality music.

50|$|Subsequently, Prevel {{engaged the}} {{assistance}} of Top Star Computer Services, Inc. (also known as TSCS), a New Jersey company that provided quality assurance services to game developers. Top Star's President, Rich Heimlich was sufficiently impressed by a product demonstration in Quebec in 1987 to endorse the product to his top customers. Sierra On-Line's King's Quest IV became the first game-title to support the <b>AdLib.</b> The game's high audio-production values, including a hired professional composer, riding on an already popular game-franchise, catapulted the <b>AdLib</b> card into mainstream media coverage. Soon, all game developers embraced the <b>Adlib,</b> hoping to give their software a competitive edge.|$|E
