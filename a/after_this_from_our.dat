But by that time distrust had already taken possession of the English and their soldiery again, and all Rouen was in an angry and threatening mood.

As a consequence of our method, we also show that every right ordered group can be embedded in a right ordered group in which any two non-identity elements are conjugate...|$|R

40|$|One {{consequence}} of globalisation is the demand on academics to better {{prepare students for}} work and life in an interconnected world through curriculum internationalisation. Many academics are hesitant, resistant, or ill-prepared to engage with curriculum internationalisation. This paper explores how this can be addressed by reconfiguring the way academic developers engage with academics within their teaching/program teams at the discipline level. Drawing on Star Trek and nomadic space, we theorise a participatory, situative approach to engaging disciplinary academic teams in the internationalisation of the curriculum process. We illustrate <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> work with teaching/program teams in two Australian universities...|$|R
