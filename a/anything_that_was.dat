5|$|Innes' {{case against}} Marshall {{ended in a}} hung jury in 1814. Rather than retry the case, Marshall and Innes signed an {{agreement}} to end the legal battle in 1815. The agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> disrespectful of the other. Innes upheld {{his part of the}} agreement, but in 1824, eight years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated two-volume version of his History of Kentucky that was even more critical of Innes and others he suspected of participating in the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled {{even if it was}} not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} the {{animation}} from the producers' point-of-view was {{that it did not}} exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time {{there were only a few}} choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E

50|$|Point-of-value is a {{department}} or a specialized {{area of a}} company that involves producing, saving or reinvesting money.

5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her public role. She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china against the wall, and tossed <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting {{with him at the}} balls and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E

25|$|The Protestant Reformation {{resulted}} in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the regulative principle of worship, favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, {{which was to}} be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as exclusive psalmody. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the Presbyterian churches of western Scotland.|$|E
25|$|The term mod {{derives from}} modernist, a term {{used in the}} 1950s to {{describe}} modern jazz musicians and fans. This usage contrasted with the term trad, which described traditional jazz players and fans. The 1959 novel Absolute Beginners describes modernists as young modern jazz fans who dress in sharp modern Italian clothes. The novel {{may be one of}} the earliest examples of the term being written to describe young British style-conscious modern jazz fans. This usage of the word modernist should not be confused with modernism in the context of literature, art, design and architecture. From the mid-to-late 1960s onwards, the mass media often used the term mod in a wider sense to describe <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> believed to be popular, fashionable or modern.|$|E

25|$|The German film industry, {{which was}} {{protected}} {{during the war}} by the ban on foreign films import, became exposed {{at the end of}} the war to the international film industry while having to face an embargo, this time on its own films. Many countries banned the import of German films and audiences themselves were resisting <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> “German”. In addition, the economic situation was unstable and the devaluation of the currency made it difficult for the smaller production companies to function. Film industry financing was a fragile business and expensive productions occasionally led to bankruptcy. In 1925 UFA itself was forced to go into a disadvantageous partnership called Parufamet with the American studios Paramount and MGM, before being taken over by the nationalist industrialist and newspaper owner Alfred Hugenberg in 1927.|$|E
25|$|The Lex Saxonum {{has come}} down to us in two manuscripts and two old editions (those of B. J. Herold and du Tillet), and the text has been edited by Karl von Richthofen in the Mon. Germ. hist, Leges, v. The law {{contains}} ancient customary enactments of Saxony, and, in the form in which it reached us, is later than the conquest of Saxony by Charlemagne. It is preceded by two capitularies of Charlemagne for Saxony, the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae (A. Boretius i. 68), which dates undoubtedly from 782, and is characterized by great severity, death being the penalty for every offence against the Christian religion; and the Capitulare Saxonicum (A. Boretius i. 71), of the 28 October 797, in which Charlemagne shows less brutality and pronounces simple compositions for misdeeds that formerly warranted death. The Lex Saxonum apparently dates from 803, since it contains provisions {{that are in the}} Capitulare legi Ribuariae additum of that year. The law established the ancient customs, at the same time eliminating <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> contrary to the spirit of Christianity; it proclaimed the peace of the churches, whose possessions it guaranteed and whose right of asylum it recognized.|$|E
25|$|This {{language}} revival had {{exposed the}} Tamils to {{the richness of}} their literature and more than two thousand years of history. It was seen by Tamils that Hindi, an undeveloped language, was being imposed on them. This renaissance, coupled with the new-found awareness of its uniqueness {{when compared to the}} Northern Indian languages, led to suspicion of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> Northern. Anti-Brahminism sentiments that had arisen further complicated the antipathy to the North, since it was seen by leaders like Periyar as an import from the North. Periyar and his DK, as did the DK’s predecessor Justice Party, saw the British Raj as the only alternative to Brahmin dominance. The resultant Tamil nationalism had until then not been expressed as violence. Both under the British and in independent India the Tamils have had a somewhat privileged position, since they were much sought after as labour, partly because the standard of education and knowledge of English have been to some extent higher than elsewhere in India; consequently Tamils have secured a large share of appointments in government service and education. Perhaps because of this, Tamil linguistic feelings had never turned against English. As Tamils saw English not as a threat, but a tool for advancement and protection of their interest, replacing English with Hindi, even as a suggestion, provoked violently adverse reactions, in particular, amongst students. Thus the introduction of Hindi as a national language was seen as direct measure of the North to dominate the South culturally, economically, and politically. For them the use of English as an official language meant social equality where a Northerner and a Southerner start at a same point in English.|$|E
