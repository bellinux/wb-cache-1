50|$|Qward {{was ruled}} by their universe's {{version of the}} Monitor (that would {{come to be called}} the Anti-Monitor by Earth's heroes).

5000|$|On 15 June 2015 NASA's Swift {{satellite}} {{detected the}} first signs of renewed activity. A worldwide observing campaign was commenced and on 17 June ESA's INTEGRAL Gamma-ray observatory started monitoring the outburst. INTEGRAL has been detecting [...] "repeated bright flashes of light time scales shorter than an hour, something rarely seen in other black hole systems", and during these flashes V404 Cygni is the brightest object in the X-ray sky - up to fifty times brighter than the Crab Nebula. This outburst is the first since 1989. Other outbursts occurred in 1938 and 1956, and the outbursts are probably caused by material piling up in a disk around the black hole until a tipping point is reached. The outburst was unusual in that physical processes in the inner accretion disk were detectable in optical photometry from small telescopes; previously, these variations were thought to be detectable with space-based X-ray telescopes only. A detailed analysis of the INTEGRAL data revealed the existence of so-called pair plasma near the black hole. This plasma consists of electrons and their <b>antimatter</b> <b>counterparts,</b> positrons.|$|R
40|$|Leptons, e. g. muons, {{are ideal}} tools {{to explore the}} hot and dense matter created at heavy-ion {{collider}} experiments, because they have minimal final state interactions {{and as a result}} are able to preserve information of the hot medium. This thesis focuses on two leptonic physics results of the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Lab – dimuons and muonic atom production. The first measurement of dimuon production at low invariant mass is presented, using data collected from Au + Au collisions at psNN = 200 GeV. An excess of the dimuon yield over known hadronic contributions in the mass region 0. 2 - 0. 55 GeV/c 2 is found. This excess might be sensitive to modified ⇢ meson spectrum function in hot medium, which has been proposed to be related to chiral symmetry restoration. This thesis also presents the first search results of muonic atoms in heavy-ion collisions. Femtoscopic correlations indicate hadrons and muons are produced at the same space-time point, providing a signature of atom ionization at the detector beam pipe. Invariant mass signals are observed for Kμ and pμ atoms and their <b>antimatter</b> <b>counterparts.</b> The measured yields and a calculation from a coalescence model are found not in agreement, suggesting significant other sources in the calculation may be needed...|$|R

40|$|Probing {{the frontiers}} of {{particle}} physics and delving into {{the mysteries of the}} universe and its beginnings require machines that can accelerate beams of fundamental particles to very high energies and then collide those beams together, producing a multitude of exotic subatomic particles. The proposed Next Linear Collider (NLC), being developed by Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), is such a machine. The NLC is expected to produce a variety of subatomic particles by smashing together electrons and their <b>antimatter</b> <b>counterparts</b> (positrons) at nearly the speed of light with energies in the teraelectronvolt (TeV) range. Plans are that the NLC will initially operate at 0. 5 TeV and ultimately be scaled up to 1. 5 TeV. (See S&TR, April 2000, pp. 12 - 16.) Work at the facility will complement the research to be conducted at another high-energy particle accelerator, the 14 -TeV Large Hadron Collider at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (commonly known by the acronym CERN from its former name) in Geneva, which is scheduled for completion in 2007. Achieving beam energy levels in the TeV range requires modulator systems that can convert ac line power [...] the same type of power one gets from the wall plug [...] into dc pulses. Ultimately, these pulses are transformed into radiofrequency (rf) pulses that ''kick'' the particles up to the required energy levels. Livermore scientists and engineers have designed a solid-state modulator to replace oldstyle modulators based on vacuum-tube technology. These new modulators promise to be far more efficient, reliable, and serviceable than the previous components. Livermore's Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program supported the basic research and development on the solid-state modulator technology, and SLAC supported the systems integration...|$|R
40|$|Compelling {{arguments}} {{suggest the}} presence of new physics at energy scales that will be probed by frontier energy colliders over the next decade. Arguments {{for each of the}} many flavors of new physics that have been proposed seem much less compelling. The wide variety of experimental signatures by which new physics may manifest itself suggests the desirability of analyzing all high energy collider data in one systematic framework. These proceedings describe two potentially useful pieces of such a framework: Sleuth enables a model-independent search for new high-pT physics, and Quaero automates tests of particular hypotheses against high energy collider data. A sampling of algorithmic detail is provided {{in the form of a}} procedure for choosing an optimal binning when computing likelihood ratios. 1. CONTEXT The audience for this talk (and these proceedings) comprises astrophysicists, cosmologists, and statisticians, in addition to high energy experimentalists. It is therefore worth beginning by discussing the nature of high energy collider data, particularly those features that make these data amenable to the algorithms described here. These data are collected by large, complex detectors that record on roughly a million channels the debris from the collisions of particles (protons, electrons, and their <b>antimatter</b> <b>counterparts)</b> travelling within a few hundred miles per hour of the speed of light. The information contained in these million channels of electronics is reduced through a series of steps to roughly one dozen numbers, corresponding to the energies and directions (polar and azimuthal angles) of the elementary objects emerging from the collision. This severe reduction in detail facilitates a direct con-Figure 1 : A Feynman diagram, showing the annihilation of a quark (q) and antiquark (¯q), and the subsequent production and decay of a top quark (t) and an antitop quark (¯t).

40|$|In the Standard Model, CP {{violation}} in weak interactions involving quarks is parameterized by an irreducible {{complex phase}} in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing-matrix. The precise determination of the CKM elements is a necessary ingredient for a stringent test of the Standard Model predictions, and is a crucial input for reducing the theoretical error in many New Physics searches with flavor, e. g., in the kaon sector. The unitarity of the CKM matrix is typically expressed as a triangle relationship among its parameters, where {{the area of the}} so-called Unitarity Triangle visually depicts the amount of asymmetry between the decays of B particles and their <b>antimatter</b> <b>counterparts.</b> In the past few years, the BABAR and Belle experiments have been able to measure all three angles of the triangle from CP asymmetry measurements. The first asymmetry measurements in B particle decays, about ten years ago, allowed to determine {beta}, which is now known to better than 5 % precision. The angles {alpha} and {gamma}, measured in much rarer processes, required several years of data taking before analyses could yield reliable answers. A remarkable feature is that the direct measurement of the angles of the Unitarity Triangle generates an area that is consistent with the area predicted by measurement of the sides. In this thesis we have presented the branching fraction measurements of charged and neutral B meson decays to K{sub 1 }(1270) {pi} and K{sub 1 }(1400) {pi}, obtained from a data sample of 454 million {Upsilon}(4 S) {yields} B{bar B} events. This analysis is particularly challenging from the experimental side since the branching fractions involved are very low, at the level of 10 {sup - 6 } - 10 {sup - 7 }, and the signal is characterized by the simultaneous presence of two overlapping resonances, which exhibit sizeable interference effects. The combined K{sub 1 }(1270) {pi} and K{sub 1 }(1400) {pi} signal is therefore modeled with a K-matrix formalism, which accounts for the effects of interference between the K{sub 1 }(1270) and K{sub 1 }(1400) mesons by introducing two effective parameters. The model is derived from the analysis, performed by the ACCMOR Collaboration, of the diffractive production of strange mesons...|$|R
