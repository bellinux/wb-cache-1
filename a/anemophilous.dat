5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in <b>anemophilous</b> pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of pollen grains {{to the female}} reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, {{in which case the}} plant is described as <b>anemophilous</b> (literally wind-loving). <b>Anemophilous</b> plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g. pine trees) are characteristically <b>anemophilous.</b> <b>Anemophilous</b> flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. Entomophilous (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anemophilous</b> spring {{blooming}} {{plants such}} as oak, birch, hickory, pecan, and early summer grasses may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anemophilous,</b> or wind pollinated flowers, {{are usually}} small and inconspicuous, {{and do not}} possess a scent or produce nectar. The anthers may produce {{a large number of}} pollen grains, while the stamens are {{generally}} long and protrude out of flower.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{people often}} mistakenly blame the {{conspicuous}} goldenrod flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen {{does not become}} independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by ragweed, a widespread <b>anemophilous</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|The apex of {{the stem}} ends in the tassel, an {{inflorescence}} of male flowers. When the tassel is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry, anthers on the tassel dehisce and release pollen. Maize pollen is <b>anemophilous</b> (dispersed by wind), and because of its large settling velocity, most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel.|$|E
25|$|Nasal allergy to pollen {{is called}} pollinosis, and allergy {{specifically}} to grass pollen is called hay fever. Generally, pollens that cause allergies {{are those of}} <b>anemophilous</b> plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random {{and the likelihood of}} one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.|$|E
25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. Entomophilous plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms {{to make themselves}} more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of <b>anemophilous</b> (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar.|$|E
25|$|Flowers of Poaceae are {{characteristically}} {{arranged in}} spikelets, each having {{one or more}} florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed {{by one or more}} florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and <b>anemophilous</b> or wind-pollinated. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. This complex structure {{can be seen in the}} image on the right, portraying a wheat (Triticum aestivum) spikelet.|$|E
500|$|A. brownii is {{the only}} endemic species of Hawaiian Amaranthus in the Hawaiian Islands. It is an {{herbaceous}} annual plant that grows to a height of [...] and has narrow, linear leaves, small green flowers, and fruit that holds a single, dark red seed. A. brownii is monoecious; that is, {{the male and female}} flowers are found together on the same plant. It differs from other Hawaiian species of Amaranthus with its spineless leaf axils, linear leaves, and indehiscent fruits (fruit which does not open to release seeds when ripe). The fruits are ovoid and between 0.8–1mm long and 0.6–0.8mm wide. The plant is thought to be <b>anemophilous</b> (pollinated by wind).|$|E
2500|$|Abiotic {{pollination}} {{refers to}} situations where pollination is mediated without {{the involvement of}} other organisms. The {{most common form of}} abiotic pollination, anemophily, is pollination by wind. Wind pollination is very imprecise, with a minute proportion of pollen grains landing by chance on a suitable receptive stigma, the rest being wasted in the environment. This form of pollination is used by grasses, most conifers, and many deciduous trees. Hydrophily is pollination by water, and occurs in aquatic plants which release their pollen directly into the surrounding water. About 80% of all plant pollination is biotic. [...] In gymnosperms, biotic pollination is generally incidental when it occurs, though some gymnosperms and their pollinators are mutually adapted for pollination. The best-known examples probably are members of the order Cycadales and associated species of beetles. Of the abiotically pollinated species of plant, 98% are <b>anemophilous</b> and 2% hydrophilous, their pollen being transported by water.|$|E
2500|$|Pines {{are mostly}} monoecious, having {{the male and}} female cones on the same tree, though a few species are sub-dioecious, with {{individuals}} predominantly, but not wholly, single-sex. The male cones are small, typically 1–5cm long, and only present for a short period (usually in spring, though autumn in a few pines), falling as soon as they have shed their pollen. The female cones take 1.5–3 years (depending on species) to mature after pollination, with actual fertilization delayed one year. At maturity the female cones are 3–60cm long. Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales, with two seeds on each fertile scale; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile, without seeds. The seeds are mostly small and winged, and are <b>anemophilous</b> (wind-dispersed), but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing, and are bird-dispersed (see below). At maturity, the cones usually open to release the seeds, but in some of the bird-dispersed species (e.g. whitebark pine), the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open. In others, the seeds are stored in closed ("serotinous") cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open, releasing the seeds. [...] The most common form of serotiny is pyriscence, in which a resin binds the cones shut until melted by a forest fire.|$|E

6000|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{quantity and}} lightness of the pollen of <b>anemophilous</b> plants {{are no doubt}} both necessary, as their pollen has generally to be carried to the stigmas of other and often distant flowers; for, as we shall soon see, most <b>anemophilous</b> plants have their sexes separated. The fertilisation of these plants is generally aided by the stigmas being of large size or plumose; {{and in the case}} of the Coniferae, by the naked ovules secreting a drop of fluid, as shown by Delpino. Although the number of <b>anemophilous</b> species is small, as the author just quoted remarks, the number of individuals is large in comparison with that of entomophilous species. This holds good especially in cold and temperate regions, where insects are not so numerous as under a warmer climate, and where consequently entomophilous plants are less favourably situated. We see this in our forests of Coniferae and other trees, such as oaks, beeches, birches, ashes, etc.; and in the Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, which clothe our meadows and swamps; all these trees and plants being fertilised by the wind. As a large quantity of pollen is wasted by <b>anemophilous</b> plants, it is surprising that so many vigorous species of this kind abounding with individuals should still exist in any part of the world; for if they had been rendered entomophilous, their pollen would have been transported by the aid of the senses and appetites of insects with incomparably greater safety than by the wind. That such a conversion is possible can hardly be doubted, from the remarks lately made on the existence of intermediate forms; and apparently it has been effected in the group of willows, as we may infer from the nature of their nearest allies.

6000|$|There is {{no great}} {{difficulty}} in understanding how an <b>anemophilous</b> plant {{might have been}} rendered entomophilous. Pollen is a nutritious substance, and would soon have been discovered and devoured by insects; and if any adhered to their bodies {{it would have been}} carried from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower, or from one flower to another. One of the chief characteristics of the pollen of <b>anemophilous</b> plants is its incoherence; but pollen in this state can adhere to the hairy bodies of insects, as we see with some Leguminosae, Ericaceae, and Melastomaceae. We have, however, better evidence of the possibility of a transition of the above kind in certain plants being now fertilised partly by the wind and partly by insects. The common rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum) is so far in an intermediate condition, that I have seen many Diptera sucking the flowers, with much pollen adhering to their bodies; and yet the pollen is so incoherent, that clouds of it are emitted if the plant be gently shaken on a sunny day, some of which could hardly fail to fall on the large stigmas of the neighbouring flowers. According to Delpino and Hermann Muller, some species of Plantago are in a similar intermediate condition. (10/44. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) ...|$|E

60|$|The {{nature and}} {{relations}} of plants which are fertilised {{by the wind}} have been admirably discussed by Delpino and Hermann Muller; and I have already made some remarks {{on the structure of}} their flowers in contrast with those of entomophilous species. (10/42. Delpino 'Ult. Osservazioni sulla Dicogamia' part 2 fasc. 1 1870 and 'Studi sopra un Lignaggio anemofilo' etc. 1871. Hermann Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. pages 412, 442. Both these authors remark that plants must have been <b>anemophilous</b> before they were entomophilous. Hermann Muller further discusses in a very interesting manner the steps by which entomophilous flowers became nectariferous and gradually acquired their present structure through successive beneficial changes.) There is good {{reason to believe that the}} first plants which appeared on this earth were cryptogamic; and judging from what now occurs, the male fertilising element must either have possessed the power of spontaneous movement through the water or over damp surfaces, or have been carried by currents of water to the female organs. That some of the most ancient plants, such as ferns, possessed true sexual organs there can hardly be a doubt; and this shows, as Hildebrand remarks, at how early a period the sexes were separated. (10/43. 'Die Geschlechter-Vertheilung' 1867 pages 84-90.) As soon as plants became phanerogamic and grew on the dry ground, if they were ever to intercross, it would be indispensable that the male fertilising element should be transported by some means through the air; and the wind is the simplest means of transport. There must also have been a period when winged insects did not exist, and plants would not then have been rendered entomophilous. Even at a somewhat later period the more specialised orders of the Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, which are now chiefly concerned with the transport of pollen, did not exist. Therefore the earliest terrestrial plants known to us, namely, the Coniferae and Cycadiae, no doubt were <b>anemophilous,</b> like the existing species of these same groups. A vestige of this early state of things is likewise shown by some other groups of plants which are <b>anemophilous,</b> as these on the whole stand lower in the scale than entomophilous species.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems at}} first sight a still more {{surprising}} fact that plants, after having been once rendered entomophilous, should ever again have become anemophilous; but this has occasionally though rarely occurred, for instance, with the common Poterium sanguisorba, as may be inferred from its belonging to the Rosaceae. Such cases are, however, intelligible, as almost all plants require to be occasionally intercrossed; and if any entomiphilous species ceased to be visited by insects, it would probably perish unless it were rendered <b>anemophilous.</b> A plant would be neglected by insects if nectar failed to be secreted, unless indeed a large supply of attractive pollen was present; and from {{what we have seen}} of the excretion of saccharine fluid from leaves and glands being largely governed in several cases by climatic influences, and from some few flowers which do not now secrete nectar still retaining coloured guiding-marks, the failure of the secretion cannot be considered as a very improbable event. The same result would follow to a certainty, if winged insects ceased to exist in any district, or became very rare. Now there is only a single plant in the great order of the Cruciferae, namely, Pringlea, which is <b>anemophilous,</b> and this plant is an inhabitant of Kerguelen Land, where there are hardly any winged insects, owing probably, as was suggested by me in the case of Madeira, to the risk which they run of being blown out to sea and destroyed.

60|$|Instead of {{the first}} change {{occurring}} in the female organs we may suppose that the male ones first varied, so that some individuals produced a larger supply of pollen. This would be beneficial under certain circumstances, such as {{a change in the}} nature of the insects which visited the flowers, or in their becoming more <b>anemophilous,</b> for such plants require an enormous quantity of pollen. The increased action of the male organs would tend to affect through compensation the female organs of the same flower; and the final result would be that the species would consist of males and hermaphrodites. But it is of no use considering this case and other analogous ones, for, as stated in the Introduction, the coexistence of male and hermaphrodite plants is excessively rare.|$|E
6000|$|In {{a letter}} just {{received}} from Mr. Henslow, {{he gives a}} few additional illustrations of his views, of which the following are the most important: [...] "Passing to Incompletae, the orders known collectively as 'Cyclospermeae' are related to Caryophylleae; and to my mind are degradations from it, of which Orache is <b>anemophilous.</b> Cupuliferae have an inferior ovary and rudimentary calyx-limb on the top. These, as far as I know, cannot be interpreted except as degradations. The whole of Monocotyledons appear to me (from anatomical reasons especially) to be degradations from Dicotyledons, and primarily {{through the agency of}} growth in water. Many subsequently became terrestrial, but retained the effects of their primitive habitat through heredity. The 3-merous [sic] perianth of grasses, the parts of the flower being in whorls, point to a degradation from a sub-liliaceous condition." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{amount of}} pollen {{produced}} by <b>anemophilous</b> plants, {{and the distance}} {{to which it is}} often transported by the wind, are both surprisingly great. Mr. Hassall found that the weight of pollen produced by a single plant of the Bulrush (Typha) was 144 grains. Bucketfuls of pollen, chiefly of Coniferae and Gramineae, have been swept off the decks of vessels near the North American shore; and Mr. Riley has seen the ground near St. Louis, in Missouri, covered with pollen, as if sprinkled with sulphur; and there was good reason to believe that this had been transported from the pine-forests at least 400 miles to the south. Kerner has seen the snow-fields on the higher Alps similarly dusted; and Mr. Blackley found numerous pollen-grains, in one instance 1200, adhering to sticky slides, which were sent up to a height of from 500 to 1000 feet by means of a kite, and then uncovered by a special mechanism. It is remarkable that in these experiments there were on an average nineteen times as many pollen-grains in the atmosphere at the higher than at the lower levels. (10/54. For Mr. Hassall's observations see 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 8 1842 page 108. In the 'North American Journal of Science' January 1842, there is an account of the pollen swept off the decks of a vessel. Riley 'Fifth Report on the Noxious Insects of Missouri' 1873 page 86. Kerner 'Die Schutzmittel des Pollens' 1873 page 6. This author has also seen a lake in the Tyrol so covered with pollen, that the water no longer appeared blue. Mr. Blackley 'Experimental Researches on Hay-fever' 1873 pages 132, 141-152.) Considering these facts, it is not so surprising as it at first appears that all, or nearly all, the stigmas of <b>anemophilous</b> plants should receive pollen brought to them by mere chance by the wind. During the early part of summer every object is thus dusted with pollen; for instance, I examined for another purpose the labella {{of a large number of}} flowers of the Fly Ophrys (which is rarely visited by insects), and found on all very many pollen-grains of other plants, which had been caught by their velvety surfaces.|$|E
60|$|As two {{objects in}} most respects opposed, namely, {{cross-fertilisation}} and self-fertilisation, have {{in many cases}} to be gained, we can understand the co-existence in so many flowers of structures which appear at first sight unnecessarily complex and of an opposed nature. We can thus understand the great contrast in structure between cleistogene flowers, which are adapted exclusively for self-fertilisation, and ordinary flowers on the same plant, which are adapted so as to allow of at least occasional cross-fertilisation. (10/21. Fritz Muller has discovered in the animal kingdom 'Jenaische Zeitschr.' B. 4 page 451, a case curiously analogous {{to that of the}} plants which bear cleistogene and perfect flowers. He finds in the nests of termites in Brazil, males and females with imperfect wings, which do not leave the nests and propagate the species in a cleistogene manner, but only if a fully-developed queen after swarming does not enter the old nest. The fully-developed males and females are winged, and individuals from distinct nests can hardly fail often to intercross. In the act of swarming they are destroyed in almost infinite numbers by a host of enemies, so that a queen may often fail to enter an old nest; and then the imperfectly developed males and females propagate and keep up the stock.) The former are always minute, completely closed, with their petals more or less rudimentary and never brightly coloured; they never secrete nectar, never are odoriferous, have very small anthers which produce only a few grains of pollen, and their stigmas are but little developed. Bearing in mind that some flowers are cross-fertilised by the wind (called <b>anemophilous</b> by Delpino), and others by insects (called entomophilous), we can further understand, as was pointed out by me several years ago, the great contrast in appearance between these two classes of flowers. (10/22. 'Journal of the Linnean Society' volume 7 Botany 1863 page 77.) <b>Anemophilous</b> flowers resemble in many respects cleistogene flowers, but differ widely in not being closed, in producing an extraordinary amount of pollen which is always incoherent, and in the stigma often being largely developed or plumose. We certainly owe the beauty and odour of our flowers and the storage of a large supply of honey to the existence of insects.|$|E
6000|$|... "The genus Plantago, like Thalictrum minus, Poterium, and others, well {{illustrate}} {{the change from}} an entomophilous to the <b>anemophilous</b> state. P. lanceolata has polymorphic flowers, and is visited by pollen-seeking insects, {{so that it can}} be fertilised either by insects or the wind. P. media illustrates transitions in point of structure, as the filaments are pink, the anthers motionless, and the pollen grains aggregated, and it is regularly visited by Bombus terrestris. On the other hand, the slender filaments, versatile anthers, powdery pollen, and elongated protogynous style are features of other species indicating anemophily; while the presence of a degraded corolla shows its ancestors to have been entomophilous. P. media, therefore, illustrates, not a primitive entomophilous condition, but a return to it; just as is the case with Sanguisorba officinalis and Salix Caprea; but these show no capacity of restoring the corolla, the attractive features having to be borne by the calyx, which is purplish in Sanguisorba, by the pink filaments of Plantago, and by the yellow anthers in the Sallow willow" [...] (p. 271).|$|E
60|$|All {{the species}} {{hitherto}} mentioned which produce cleistogamic flowers are entomophilous; but four genera, Juncus, Hordeum, Cryptostachys, and Leersia are <b>anemophilous.</b> Juncus bufonius is remarkable by bearing {{in parts of}} Russia only cleistogamic flowers, which contain three instead of the six anthers found in the perfect flowers. (8/22. See Dr. Ascherson's interesting paper in 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 page 551.) In the genus Hordeum {{it has been shown}} by Delpino {{that the majority of the}} flowers are cleistogamic, some of the others expanding and apparently allowing of cross-fertilisation. (8/23. 'Bollettini del Comizio agrario Parmense.' Marzo e Aprile 1871. An abstract of this valuable paper is given in 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 page 537. See also Hildebrand on Hordeum in 'Monatsbericht d. K. Akad Berlin' October 1872 page 760.) I hear from Fritz Muller that there is a grass in Southern Brazil, in which the sheath of the uppermost leaf, half a metre in length, envelopes the whole panicle; and this sheath never opens until the self-fertilised seeds are ripe. On the roadside some plants had been cut down, whilst the cleistogamic panicles were developing, and these plants afterwards produced free or unenclosed panicles of small size, bearing perfect flowers.|$|E
60|$|Why the {{descendants}} of plants which were originally dioecious, and which therefore profited by always intercrossing with another individual, should have been converted into hermaphrodites, may perhaps {{be explained by the}} risk which they ran, especially {{as long as they were}} <b>anemophilous,</b> of not being always fertilised, and consequently of not leaving offspring. This latter evil, the greatest of all to any organism, would have been much lessened by their becoming hermaphrodites, though with the contingent disadvantage of frequent self-fertilisation. By what graduated steps an hermaphrodite condition was acquired we do not know. But we can see that if a lowly organised form, in which the two sexes were represented by somewhat different individuals, were to increase by budding either before or after conjugation, the two incipient sexes would be capable of appearing by buds on the same stock, as occasionally occurs with various characters at the present day. The organism would then be in a monoecious condition, and this is probably the first step towards hermaphroditism; for if very simple male and female flowers on the same stock, each consisting of a single stamen or pistil, were brought close together and surrounded by a common envelope, in nearly the same manner as with the florets of the Compositae, we should have an hermaphrodite flower.|$|E
60|$|This {{plant is}} monoecious, and was {{selected}} for trial on this account, no other such plant having been experimented on. (6/8. Hildebrand remarks that this species seems at first sight adapted to be fertilised by pollen from the same plant, owing to the male flowers standing above the female flowers; but practically it must generally be fertilised by pollen from another plant, as the male flowers usually shed their pollen before the female flowers are mature: 'Monatsbericht der K. Akad.' Berlin October 1872 page 743.) It is also <b>anemophilous,</b> or is fertilised by the wind; and of such plants only the common beet had been tried. Some plants were raised in the greenhouse, and were crossed with pollen taken from a distinct plant; and a single plant, growing quite separately in {{a different part of}} the house, was allowed to fertilise itself spontaneously. The seeds thus obtained were placed on damp sand, and as they germinated in pairs of equal age were planted on the opposite sides of four very large pots; nevertheless they were considerably crowded. The pots were kept in the hothouse. The plants were first measured to the tips of their leaves when only between 1 and 2 feet in height, as shown in Table 6/97.|$|E
60|$|Dioecious plants, however fertilised, {{have a great}} {{advantage}} over other plants in their cross-fertilisation being assured. But this advantage is gained {{in the case of}} <b>anemophilous</b> species {{at the expense of the}} production of an enormous superfluity of pollen, with some risk to them and to entomophilous species of their fertilisation occasionally failing. Half the individuals, moreover, namely, the males, produce no seed, and this might possibly be a disadvantage. Delpino remarks that dioecious plants cannot spread so easily as monoecious and hermaphrodite species, for a single individual which happened to reach some new site could not propagate its kind; but it may be doubted whether this is a serious evil. Monoecious plants can hardly fail to be to a large extent dioecious in function, owing to the lightness of their pollen and to the wind blowing laterally, with the great additional advantage of occasionally or often producing some self-fertilised seeds. When they are also dichogamous, they are necessarily dioecious in function. Lastly, hermaphrodite plants can generally produce at least some self-fertilised seeds, and they are at the same time capable, through the various means specified in this chapter, of cross-fertilisation. When their structure absolutely prevents self-fertilisation, they are in the same relative position to one another as monoecious and dioecious plants, with what may be an advantage, namely, that every flower is capable of yielding seeds.|$|E
60|$|Finally, we {{have seen}} {{reason to believe that}} the higher plants are descended from {{extremely}} low forms which conjugated, and that the conjugating individuals differed somewhat from one another,--the one representing the male and the other the female--so that plants were aboriginally dioecious. At a very early period such lowly organised dioecious plants probably gave rise by budding to monoecious plants with the two sexes borne by the same individual; and by a still closer union of the sexes to hermaphrodite plants, which are now much the commonest form. (10/63. There is a considerable amount of evidence that all the higher animals are the descendants of hermaphrodites; and it is a curious problem whether such hermaphroditism may not have been the result of the conjugation of two slightly different individuals, which represented the two incipient sexes. On this view, the higher animals may now owe their bilateral structure, with all their organs double at an early embryonic period, to the fusion or conjugation of two primordial individuals.) As soon as plants became affixed to the ground, their pollen must have been carried by some means from flower to flower, at first almost certainly by the wind, then by pollen-devouring, and afterwards by nectar-seeking insects. During subsequent ages some few entomophilous plants have been again rendered <b>anemophilous,</b> and some hermaphrodite plants have had their sexes again separated; and we can vaguely see the advantages of such recurrent changes under certain conditions.|$|E
60|$|Delpino {{states that}} this plant {{presents}} in Italy three forms, which graduate from an <b>anemophilous</b> into an entomophilous condition. According to H. Muller, {{there are only}} two forms in Germany, neither of which show any special adaptation for insect fertilisation, and both appear to be hermaphrodites. (7/19. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) But I have found in two localities in England female and hermaphrodite forms existing together; and the same fact has been noticed by others. (7/20. Mr. C.W. Crocker 'The Gardener's Chronicle' 1864 page 294. Mr. W. Marshall writes to me to the same effect from Ely.) The females are less frequent than the hermaphrodites; their stamens are short, and their anthers, which are of a brighter green whilst young than those of the other form, dehisce properly, yet contain either no pollen, or a small amount of imperfect grains of variable size. All the flower-heads on a plant belong to the same form. It is well known that this species is strongly proterogynous, and I found that the protruding stigmas of both the hermaphrodite and female flowers were penetrated by pollen-tubes, whilst their own anthers were immature and had not escaped out of the bud. Plantago media does not present two forms; but it appears from Asa Gray's description, that such is the case with four of the North American species. (7/21. 'Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States' 2nd edition 1856 page 269. See also 'American Journal of Science' November 1862 page 419 and 'Proceedings of the American Academy of Science' October 14, 1862 page 53.) The corolla does not properly expand in the short- stamened form of these plants.|$|E
60|$|It {{has already}} been shown that in about 32 out of the 55 genera in the list just {{referred}} to, the perfect flowers are irregular; and this implies {{that they have been}} specially adapted for fertilisation by insects. Moreover three of the genera with regular flowers are adapted by other means for the same end. Flowers thus constructed are liable during certain seasons to be imperfectly fertilised, namely, when the proper insects are scarce; {{and it is difficult to}} avoid the belief that the production of cleistogamic flowers, which ensures under all circumstances a full supply of seed, has been in part determined by the perfect flowers being liable to fail in their fertilisation. But if this determining cause be a real one, it must be of subordinate importance, as four of the genera in the list are fertilised by the wind; and there seems no reason why their perfect flowers should fail to be fertilised more frequently than those in any other <b>anemophilous</b> genus. In contrast with what we here see with respect to the large proportion of the perfect flowers being irregular, one genus alone out of the 38 heterostyled genera described in the previous chapters bears such flowers; yet all these genera are absolutely dependent on insects for their legitimate fertilisation. I know not how to account for this difference in the proportion of the plants bearing regular and irregular flowers in the two classes, unless it be that the heterostyled flowers are already so well adapted for cross-fertilisation, through the position of their stamens and pistils and the difference in power of their two or three kinds of pollen, that any additional adaptation, namely, through the flowers being made irregular, has been rendered superfluous.|$|E
60|$|It {{has long}} been known that this plant {{produces}} cleistogamic flowers, but these were first described with care by M. Duval-Jouve. (8/24. 'Bulletin Bot. Soc. de France' tome 10 1863 page 194.) I procured plants from a stream near Reigate, and cultivated them for several years in my greenhouse. The cleistogamic flowers are very small, and usually mature their seeds within the sheaths of the leaves. These flowers are said by Duval-Jouve to be filled by slightly viscid fluid; but {{this was not the case}} with several that I opened; but there was a thin film of fluid between the coats of the glumes, and when these were pressed the fluid moved about, giving a similarly deceptive appearance of the whole inside of the flower being thus filled. The stigma is very small and the filaments extremely short; the anthers are less than 1/50 of an inch in length or about one-third of the length of those in the perfect flowers. One of the three anthers dehisces before the two others. Can this have any relation with the fact that in some other species of Leersia only two stamens are fully developed? (8/25. Asa Gray 'Manual of Botany of the United States' 1856 page 540.) The anthers shed their pollen on the stigma; at least in one instance this was clearly the case, and by tearing open the anthers under water the grains were easily detached. Towards the apex of the anther the grains are arranged in a single row and lower down in two or three rows, so that they could be counted; and there were about 35 in each cell, or 70 in the whole anther; and this is an astonishingly small number for an <b>anemophilous</b> plant. The grains have very delicate coats, are spherical and about 5/7000 of an inch (.0181 millimetres), whilst those of the perfect flowers are about 7/7000 of an inch (.0254 millimetres) in diameter.|$|E
50|$|The {{transfer}} of pollen grains {{to the female}} reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, {{in which case the}} plant is described as <b>anemophilous</b> (literally wind-loving). <b>Anemophilous</b> plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g. pine trees) are characteristically <b>anemophilous.</b> <b>Anemophilous</b> flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. Entomophilous (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.|$|E
