40|$|The central problem {{addressed}} by the discipline of economics is that of resource scarcity, and so the purpose of economic evaluation is, in a very broad sense, to help decision-makers when addressing problems arising due to the scarcity issue. Therefore, such evidence is generated with the direct intention of influencing policy. Over recent years, there have been repeated expressions of concern about the usefulness of health economic analyses, and responses have tended to centre on questions of how research by health economists can be made more useful and accessible to policy makers. How an economic evaluation {{can be used in}} practice, is presented in the case of folic <b>acid</b> food <b>fortification.</b> After the introduction of folate deficiency problem and discussion of strengths and weaknesses of folic <b>acid</b> food <b>fortification,</b> it is demonstrated how an economic evaluation can add value to decision-making process.

25|$|Folic <b>acid</b> food <b>fortification</b> became {{mandatory}} in Canada in 1998, with the fortification of 150µg of folic acid per 100grams of enriched flour and uncooked cereal grains.

25|$|However, the folic <b>acid</b> <b>fortification</b> {{program in}} the United States has {{increased}} folic acid content of commonly eaten foods such as cereals and grains, and as a result, diets of most adults now provide recommended amounts of folate equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Canada's {{fortification}} {{program has}} been successful with a decrease of neural tube defects by 19% since its introduction.

25|$|Folate {{deficiency}} can disrupt neuralation and neurogenesis. Maternal {{folic acid}} intake {{around the time}} of conception prevents neural tube defects. Furthermore, folic acid intake was recently associated with incidence of autism. Enriched white flour is fortified with folic acid in the United States and many other countries. However the European Union does not have mandatory folic <b>acid</b> <b>fortification.</b> Although the protective effects of folic acid are well documented, there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population. For example, elevated levels of folic acid can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeration. Furthermore, folic acid and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Neural tube defects (NTDs) are {{associated}} with deficient maternal folic acid peri-conceptionally. In Ireland, there is no mandatory folic <b>acid</b> food <b>fortification,</b> partly due to declining NTD rates in recent years. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain the incident rate of NTD during the period 2009 – 11 and describe epidemiologically NTD in Ireland. METHODS Cases were ascertained through multiple sources, including three regional congenital anomaly registers, all maternity hospitals nationally and paediatric hospitals providing care for children with spina bifida in the Republic of Ireland during the period 2009 – 11. RESULTS From 225 998 total births, 236 NTDs were identified, giving an incidence of 1. 04 / 1 000 births, increasing from 0. 92 / 1 000 in 2009 to 1. 17 / 1 000 in 2011. Of all cases, 45 % (n 106) had anencephaly, 49 % (n 115) had spina bifida and 6 % (n 15) had an encephalocoele; 78 % (n 184) were liveborn or stillborn and 22 % (n 52) were terminations abroad.

50|$|Fortification {{of foods}} with folic acid has been {{mandated}} {{in many countries}} solely to improve the folate status of pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects—a relatively rare birth defect which affected 0.5% of US births before fortification began. However, when fortification is introduced, several hundred thousand people are exposed to an increased intake of folic acid for each neural tube defect pregnancy that is prevented. In humans, increased folic acid intake leads to elevated blood concentrations of naturally occurring folates and of unmetabolized folic acid. High blood concentrations of folic acid may decrease natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and high folate status may reduce the response to drugs used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer. A combination of high folate levels and low vitamin B-12 status {{may be associated with}} an increased risk of cognitive impairment and anemia in the elderly and, in pregnant women, with an increased risk of insulin resistance and obesity in their children.

More than 82 % reached NTD-protective concentrations of RBC and plasma folate and ~ 30 % reached SP concentrations of plasma folate.

40|$|The {{original}} {{theory of}} the multi-step process of colorectal cancer (CRC), suggesting that the disease resulted from the accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in colonic mucosa cells, has been largely revised following the observation that epigenetic modifications of several genes occur in the average CRC genome. Therefore, the current opinion is that CRCs are the consequence of the accumulation of both mutations and epigenetic modifications of several genes. This mini-review article focuses on DNA methylation biomarkers in CRC. Recent large-scale DNA methylation studies suggest that CRCs {{can be divided into}} at least three-four subtypes according to the frequency of DNA methylation and those of mutations in key CRC genes. Despite hundreds of genes might be epigenetically modified in CRC cells, there is interest in the identification of DNA methylation biomarkers to be used for CRC diagnosis, progression, tendency to tissue invasion and metastasis, prognosis, and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, DNA methylation largely depends on one-carbon metabolism, the metabolic pathway required for the production of S-adenosylmethionine, the major intracellular methylating agent.
