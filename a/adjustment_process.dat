25|$|The {{stock market}} crash in the 1929 not only {{affected}} {{the business community and}} the public’s economic confidence, but also it led to the banking system soon after the turmoil. The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is precisely because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist Kindleberger of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and {{after the collapse of the}} stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic <b>adjustment</b> <b>process,</b> the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked. Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.|$|E

The Gauss-Newton nonlinear regression method is used to estimate the structural parameters of the generalized model. Results show that adjustment to target ratios is not instantaneous.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reappraisal of unemployment {{movements in the}} European Union. Our analysis {{is based on the}} chain reaction theory of unemployment, which focuses on (a) the interaction among labor market <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes,</b> (b) the interplay between these <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> and the dynamic structure of labor market shocks, and (c) the interaction between the <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> and economic growth. We divide the shocks into institutional variables, price variables, and growth drivers. Estimating a system of labor market equations for a panel of EU countries, we derive the dynamic unemployment responses to each shock. Our analysis permits us to distinguish between the short- and long-run effects of the shocks. Different shocks generate different degrees of "unemployment persistence" (responses to temporary shocks) and "unemployment responsiveness" (responses to permanent shocks). We find that the growth drivers play a dominant role in accounting for the main swings in EU unemployment.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze and {{estimate}} salient characteristics of unemployment dynamics. Movements in unemployment are viewed as "chain reactions" of responses to labour market shocks, working their way through systems of interacting lagged <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes.</b> In the context of estimated labour market systems for Germany, the UK, and the US, we construct aggregate measures of unemployment responses to temporary and permanent shocks. These measures are temporal and quantitative. Furthermore, we estimate the contributions of individual lagged adjustments to these aggregate measures. Our empirical results indicate that lagged <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> play an important part in explaining how temporary and permanent shocks affect unemployment, that temporary and permanent shocks can yield quite different inter-country comparisons of unemployment effects, and that the quantitative and temporal measures can also yield markedly different inter-country comparisons. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the theoretical}} and empirical implications of the Chain Reaction Theory of unemployment movements on regional unemploment persistence and regional disparities. This is the first attempt to apply this theory to a regional context. The Chain Reaction Theory focuses on the interaction among labour market <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> and the interplay of such processes and the dynamic structure of labour market shocks. Under this approach we may explain unemployment rate disparities between regions {{as the result of}} different responses to idyosincratic and aggregate shocks working their way through different labour market <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> in each region. We test empirically this theory to the Spanish case with a regional dataset covering the 1980 - 2000 period.

We argue that (a) past UK labour market shocks have prolonged after-effects on unemployment due to interactions among different lagged <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> in the labour market, (b) many of the important shocks that have hit the UK labour market over the past 25 years have been persistent, and (c) {{the persistence of the}} shocks is complementary to the persistence of the lagged <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> in generating movements of UK unemployment...|$|R
