30|$|Osteolytic {{vertebral}} erosion {{is usually}} related to tumours, spondylitis or spondylodiscitis. Few {{reports in the}} literature describe lytic lesions of anterior lumbar vertebral bodies resulting from abdominal aortic aneurysm or false aneurysm. We report a case of <b>abdominal</b> aortic <b>false</b> aneurysm that caused lytic lesions of {{the second and third}} vertebral bodies in an 80 -year-old man who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair. Fluoroscopy guided biopsy excluded infection or tumour. We performed a posterior spinal fusion and decompression because of bone loss of the second and third lumbar vertebral bodies and central stenosis. Postoperatively the patient showed satisfactory relief in low-back and thigh pain but, unfortunately, he died 1 month after surgery because of respiratory complications. This case suggests that when a lytic lesion of a lumbar vertebral body is discovered in a patient who has undergone endovascular aneurysm repair, an <b>abdominal</b> aortic <b>false</b> aneurysm may be the cause of the vertebral erosion even in cases without infective pathogenesis.|$|R

30|$|Osteolytic {{vertebral}} erosion {{is usually}} caused by neoplasms, spondylitis or spondylodiscitis. Some {{reports in the}} literature report that an abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause erosion of the lumbar vertebral body, due to a progressive aneurysmatic sac expansion [1 – 5]. Few authors [6, 7] have reported lumbar vertebral erosion resulting from abdominal aortic contained rupture aneurysm in patients surgically treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm by a conventional open surgical repair. Other authors have reported vertebral lesions resulting from endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair complicated by an infection [8, 9]. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of a case in which an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for an abdominal aortic aneurysm was complicated by an <b>abdominal</b> aortic <b>false</b> aneurysm which caused severe erosion of two lumbar vertebral bodies and disc through an inflammatory mechanism, without signs of infective pathogenesis. It is possible to assume that, despite the endovascular procedure, the pseudo-aneurysmatic sac can cause an inflammatory stimulus that is erosive for the adjacent vertebrae and discs. Pre-existing osteopenia, frequently observed in old patients, can {{contribute to the development of}} the vertebral erosion.|$|R
40|$|TOPOPHOBIA is an {{exhibition}} of contemporary art and a related book and e-publication. Originating at the Danielle Arnaud Gallery, London, January 2012, the exhibition will tour to the Bluecoat, Liverpool, and Spacex, Exeter, during {{the spring and summer}} 2012. The fear of place and the manifestation of this in contemporary art is the territory for TOPOPHOBIA. As an anxiety disorder, this phobia is understood as an irrational dread of certain places or situations yet, considered as a cultural phenomenon, topophobia connects us to the existential human question of how each of us finds our place in the world. The artworks and writing have been gathered together for a common thread; in various ways they regard place and space as somehow threatened or threatening. TOPOPHOBIA is a way of interrogating manifestations of spatial anxiety, so to better understand how they contribute to what has recently been termed the ‘culture of fear’. Freedom is the culture of fear’s first casualty. Art offers a mental space of reflection on these places of fear, and an opportunity to consider ways out of the predicaments that ensue. Although the origin of these fears might be found in places and locations, the technologies of perception that shape our understanding of space and place are also generative of anxiety. Technologies extend the body beyond the usual limits of its senses. Forms of visual representation, simulation and picturing the world, expand the body, as convincingly as any <b>false</b> <b>leg</b> or bionic arm. They supplement the scope of the body, allow it to perceive beyond its natural limits, and transcend the boundaries of vision to see what cannot otherwise be seen, or hear what cannot normally be heard. Yet these techniques of visual and aural representation paradoxically lead to a sensation of lack and disappearance; the hors champ of the camera pan accentuates what is off screen, the night vision of long exposure camera reminds us of the dark, the revealed limbs in a wearable architecture indicate a body otherwise enclosed. These technologies of disappearance paralyse us; as they extend they also curtail, as they propel us into the multiple, contradictory, distant and proximal locations, they also remove the ground from beneath our feet. The fear of place affects the sense of ones body in place. In this regard, like many of our emotions or feelings, fear connects us to our embodiment, as does aesthetic experience. Encounters with real art works in real space are always in relation to the body, the other works, and the architectural spaces. The curatorial project of TOPOPHOBIA has dealt with the expansion and contraction of space as it occurs between the touring venues and includes a series of entirely newly commissioned works that have been made in direct response to the host venues. The spaces themselves function as devices for viewing, articulating varied modes of spectatorship. These spaces, with their social and architectural mores, provoke a dis/locatedness or dis/placement for the collection of works. The public domain of the art gallery provides a circumstance for being with others in a shared experience of communal space, countering the tendency to the privatisation of experience and political implications of fear, which are too often isolating.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} our unique procedure with mild hypothermic circulatory arrest and rapid rewarming during emergency surgery for type A acute aortic dissection. MethodsDuring the last 6 years, 91 patients with acute aortic dissection and {{an average age of}} 66. 2  ±  14. 1 years underwent our newly modified quick hemiarch replacement. Eighteen patients (19. 8 %) had independent predictors for surgical mortality, such as preoperative cardiopulmonary arrest or malperfusion of vital organs. During open distal anastomosis with a rectal temperature of 28 °C without any cerebral perfusion, circulating blood in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was warmed to 40 °C, accompanied by warming of the patient's body using a heating mat. As soon as distal anastomosis was completed, rapid rewarming was initiated by 40 °C blood perfusion. ResultsCirculatory arrest, cardiopulmonary bypass, and overall operation times were 19. 1  ±  5. 1, 86. 2  ±  17. 8, and 150. 1  ±  25. 2 minutes, respectively. Five patients (5. 5 %) required reexploration for bleeding, and 4 patients (4. 4 %) had strokes, but none had acute renal failure. The hospital mortality rate was 3. 3 % (3 patients), and the postoperative hospital stay was 10. 6  ±  4. 7 days. Five patients required replacement of the distal arch or descending aorta at a later stage. Eight patients died during follow-up. A postoperative midterm computed tomography scan revealed a closed distal arch in more than 80 % of patients and partial <b>abdominal</b> open <b>false</b> lumen in 45 % of patients. Echocardiograms showed mild aortic valve regurgitation in 8 patients. The freedom from reoperation rate at 5 years was 90. 0 %. Actuarial survival including operative death was 82. 7 % at 5 years. ConclusionsOur original technique is a safe and less-invasive procedure that enables a quicker surgery. The midterm outcome also was favorable...|$|R
40|$|PHOTOS 1 - 5 : External {{abdominal}} hernias are {{defects in}} the abdominal wall allowing protrusion of the abdominal contents. External abdominal hernias involve {{any part of}} the abdominal wall other than the umbilicus, inguinal ring, femoral canal and scrotum. True hernias are those where the contents are enclosed in a peritoneal sac while false hernias are not surrounded by a peritoneal sac. <b>Abdominal</b> hernias are <b>false</b> hernias. <b>Abdominal</b> hernias occur secondary to trauma such as vehicle accidents or bite wounds but may also be congenital or iatrogenic. Abdominal hernias are defined according to their location as ventral, prepubic, subcostal, hypochondral, paracostal or lateral abdominal hernias. Abdominal hernias are painful and the animal may become anorexic. The swelling should be palpated to determine the contents of the hernia and to locate the abdominal defect. Abdominal radiographs may be made to confirm whether it is a hernia if the abdominal wall defect cannot be palpated due to swelling or pain. The initial treatment for abdominal hernias includes treating shock and internal injuries. The abdominal hernia can then be repaired by apposing the disrupted abdominal wall edge to the pubis, ribs or fascia or by suturing the torn muscle edges.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{evaluated}} {{the risk factors}} of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with extensive acute type B aortic dissection. MethodsThis was a retrospective study at Zhongda Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, China. Between January 2005 and May 2008, patients with acute type B dissection who underwent TEVAR at two centers were reviewed and 124 who met the following criteria were included in this study: (1) dissection involving the aorta {{below the level of}} the celiac artery, (2) completely patent false lumen at the time of intervention, and (3) complete initial diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans and all follow-up CT scans available. Exclusion criteria were (1) aortic dissection secondary to trauma, (2) intramural hematoma, and (3) Marfan patients. The main outcome measures were demographics, comorbidity profiles, technical details of procedures, anatomic characteristics of dissection, and false lumen status of thrombosis during follow-up. Ordinal regression analysis was performed with variables that reached P <. 20 on univariate analysis to investigate independent risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen. ResultsUnivariate analysis showed that the age at TEVAR, hypertension, maximum diameter of the <b>abdominal</b> aorta and <b>false</b> lumen at the abdominal level, re-entry tears, and visceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen had a P <. 20. Further analysis with an ordinal regression model showed that the visceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen (odds ratio [OR], 10. 054; P <. 001), re-entry tears (OR, 30. 661; P <. 001), and maximum diameter of the false lumen on the abdominal aorta (OR, 1. 265; P =. 004) were the significant risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after TEVAR. ConclusionsVisceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen, re-entry tears, and maximum diameter of the false lumen on the abdominal aorta were the risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after TEVAR in extensive acute type B dissection...|$|R
