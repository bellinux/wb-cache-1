According to Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana. the region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of favor with Manuel I, Cabral was able to {{contract}} an advantageous marriage in 1503 to Dona (Lady) Isabel de Castro, a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of King Dom Fernando I of Portugal. Her mother was a sister of Afonso de Albuquerque, {{one of the greatest}} Portuguese military leaders during the Age of Discovery. The couple had at least four children: two boys (Fernão Álvares Cabral and António Cabral) and two girls (Catarina de Castro and Guiomar de Castro). There were two additional daughters named Isabel and Leonor according to other sources, which <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Guiomar, Isabel and Leonor joined religious orders. Afonso de Albuquerque attempted to intercede on Cabral's behalf and on 2 December 1514 asked Manuel I to forgive him and allow his return to court, but to no avail.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between two models is that hierarchical model can explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non-hierarchical model can only predict joint probability of stimuli. However, hierarchical model {{is actually a}} special case of non-hierarchical model by setting joint prior as a weighted average of the prior to common and independent causes, each weighted by their prior probability. Based on the correspondence of these two models, we can <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> hierarchical is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model.|$|E

25|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the novel's {{allegations}} of dealings between John Paul II {{and the order}} concerning the Vatican Bank also have no basis in reality. Allegedly due to these dealings, Opus Dei's founder was declared a Saint just 20 years after his death. In reality, Josemaría Escrivá was canonized 27 years after his death; admittedly faster than some others—but this is attributed to streamlining of the whole process and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of Mandatory Swedish {{argue that}} it brings Finland closer to the Nordic countries, since Swedish is quite similar to, {{and to some extent}} {{mutually}} intelligible with, both Danish and Norwegian, while Finnish belongs to the unrelated Finnic language group.

Lastly, they argue, mandatory Swedish is necessary to ensure that Swedish-speakers can interact with governmental institutions and get service, such as health care, in their own mother tongue.|$|E
