5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> receptors.|$|E

5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{flavor of}} cabbage {{is caused by}} glucosinolates, a class of sulfur-containing glucosides. Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the tissue ages. Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent, unpleasant odor <b>and</b> <b>taste.</b> These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.|$|E

5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of sensory information. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood.

5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for Grant Park's outdoor concert facilities, larger annual events such as the Chicago Blues and Chicago Jazz Festivals <b>and</b> <b>Taste</b> of Chicago are too large for Jay Pritzker Pavilion and continue to be held in and around Petrillo Music Shell. The pavilion has hosted smaller festivals, such as the Chicago Gospel Music Festival, since 2005. Public opinion has been in favor of moving some of the smaller Blues and Jazz festival events to the pavilion, with its better, more modern acoustics. By 2009, as the city grappled with a budget deficit, it considered realigning parts of the larger festivals and made definite plans to move some of the smaller ones to the more modern venue.|$|E

5|$|Chile and Peru both {{claim the}} pisco sour as their {{national}} drink, and each asserts {{ownership of the}} cocktail's base liquor—pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture.

5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|John Carson as the {{replacement}} Captain Foster ("White Ghost"). A British actor {{of television and}} cinema, Carson's small-screen credits of the 1960s and 70s include The Saint, Man in a Suitcase, Department S and The Professionals, while his film roles include Plague of the Zombies (1966) <b>and</b> <b>Taste</b> the Blood of Dracula (1970). His appearances in The Troubleshooters {{attracted the attention of}} the Andersons. Carson's delivery of Foster's lines has led to a mistaken assertion that fellow British actor James Mason was cast for the role.|$|E
40|$|Neurophysiological {{correlates}} of affective experience could potentially provide continuous {{information about a}} person’s experience when cooking <b>and</b> <b>tasting</b> food, without explicitly verbalizing this. Such measures {{would be helpful to}} understand people’s implicit food preferences and choices. This study examined {{for the first time the}} relation between neurophysiological variables and affective experiences under real cooking <b>and</b> <b>tasting</b> circumstances, using ingredients that were a priori expected to evoke different affective reactions. 41 participants cooked <b>and</b> <b>tasted</b> two stir-fry dishes in random order following an identical, strictly timed protocol. Once the main ingredient was chicken and the other time mealworms. EEG, ECG and skin potential were recorded continuously. Participants scored subjective valence and arousal after each cooking <b>and</b> <b>tasting</b> session. Frontal EEG alpha asymmetry showed the expected effect throughout the whole cooking <b>and</b> <b>tasting</b> session, consistent with ‘approach’ motivation for chicken and ‘avoidance’ for mealworms. Skin potential effects differed between cooking intervals but were in the expected direction. ECG variables showed an interaction with order of cooking the different dishes. Based on EEG alpha asymmetry, ECG and skin potential variables, we can estimate with 82 % accuracy whether a single participant is preparing a dish with mealworms or with chicken. Our study provides evidence that it is possible to estimate experienced emotion during real-life cooking <b>and</b> <b>tasting.</b> We argue that it is important to consider that different neurophysiological and subjective measures reflect different underlying affective processes, to map them out more precisely, and to take advantage of these differences...|$|R

5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each {{basidiospore}} develops into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in bioluminescence <b>and</b> <b>taste,</b> {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, {{as well as between}} and within Oceanian collections.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of Tricholoma pardinum is an {{imposing}} mushroom with a pale grey cap up to 15cm (6in) in diameter that {{is covered with}} dark brownish to greyish scales. The gills are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown stalk. The spore print is white. One of the more toxic members of the genus Tricholoma, the species has been implicated {{in a number of}} episodes of mushroom poisoning, probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant smell <b>and</b> <b>taste,</b> and it bears a superficial resemblance to several edible species, like Tricholoma terreum. Ingesting T.pardinum—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent gastroenteritis caused by an unknown mycotoxin.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style <b>and</b> <b>taste.</b> The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American market as a permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe {{is exactly the same}} as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold in many of the company's international markets in several forms.|$|E
