25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{future husband}} Allan McKeown had {{reservations}} about her launching a music career and tried talking {{her out of}} it. “When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{that she had a}} big career in comedy, and she said to me, ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing. Imagine how stupid I felt about four months later, I’m in London driving around and I hear, ‘And now, the Top of the Pops, Tracey Ullman with ‘They Don’t Know About Us.’” ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how {{beautiful}} {{you are in}} your age and how bright your mind is with its old-time brightness, and how she and the children would enjoy you. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how singularly young Pamela is looking, and what a fine large fellow Sam is, and how ill the lingering syllable [...] "my" [...] to his name fits his port and figure.|$|R
60|$|I had {{no reason}} to conceal anything, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the whole affair, from the very {{beginning}} to the end.|$|R

2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how hard {{she worked for}} it ... {{and it was clear}} she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{her fifth}} album, Ciara {{contributed to both}} the writing and {{production}} of the album's songs. She wrote [...] "Sweat" [...] (featuring 2 Chainz), a song that was originally {{supposed to be the}} album's first single when the album was called One Woman Army. Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sorry", the song that was chosen to supersede [...] "Sweat" [...] as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with [...] "Got Me Good", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. [...] "Sorry" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single [...] "Promise" [...] and 2009 single [...] "Never Ever". Together the duo wrote and produced [...] "Super Turnt Up" [...] which did make the final listing for Ciara. [...] "Got Me Good" [...] was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith). When interviewed by Rap-Up TV, Jerkins said [...] "I had a meeting with her about what her future holds <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> I was there if she ever needed my creative juices, so hopefully me and her get in the studio and work." [...] Jerkins previously produced records for [...] and Fantasy Ride.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{told your}} mother," [...] he continued, [...] "all that <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> you, <b>and</b> more. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> dear, that <b>I</b> cared for you, that I {{wanted you to}} be my wife." ...|$|R

2500|$|North Carolina {{finished}} {{the regular season}} at 16–15, dropped to third in all-time wins, and bowed {{out in the first}} round of the ACC tournament. The Tar Heels did not receive a post-season tournament bid by the NCAA—the only time in Williams' coaching career that his team didn't take part in that tournament when eligible to do so. However, they did receive a bid to the NIT. The Tar Heels made it to the NIT championship game versus Dayton, which was played on April 1, 2010, at Madison Square Garden. The Tar Heels lost by a score of 79–68, bringing their overall tally to 20–17 for the 2009–10 season. This 20-win season however kept Williams' streak of 20-win seasons alive. Williams stated that the season was [...] "the biggest frustration and the biggest disappointment of my professional life". In addition to frustrating play, Williams was criticized for comparing the season to the disaster in Haiti by stating, [...] "Our massage therapist told me, she said 'You know, Coach, what happened in Haiti is a catastrophe. What you're having is a disappointment.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that depends on which chair she was sitting in, because it does feel like a catastrophe to me, and that's because it is my life." [...] Williams later apologized for his comments, stating that he misspoke and [...] "neglected to say that it puts basketball in perspective." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. It {{was terrible}} {{she seemed to}} feel so. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was sorry for her. I thought I ought to answer it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was sorry, too. I tried not to blame Richard.

6000|$|... 'I {{hope you}} will change your mind some day, but yon must do {{something}} this afternoon. You had better take a walk with Susan <b>and</b> baby; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to go by the meadows to Horton.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't say {{anything}} about mother: Did she, Christine? Or, yes, she did, too. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she couldn't git mother out. Don't you remember?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was busy}} with the dog," [...] Lady Lydiard answered. [...] "Isabel Miller was of no use in the boudoir, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to seal it for me." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{said she}} would come with me. She felt the change would do her good, and promised not to do {{anything}} when she got there. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all that <b>I</b> had done for Dick.|$|R
60|$|Thereafter when alone, {{my mother}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> often talked {{of the good}} old days in Wisconsin, of David and Deborah and William <b>and</b> Frank. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of Aunt Loretta's {{peaceful}} life, of the green hills and trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know; but {{she said}} that, to triumph over the mysteries she wished to teach me, I must free myself from earthly love <b>and</b> cares. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that, if Arthur is married, I would think of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear,' said Mrs. Woodbourne; 'she {{asked me}} {{yesterday}} {{when you were}} not near, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> you would give her one. I thought the child looked very ragged.' ...|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, {{but looked}} at me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to shut her left eye, {{but to be}} very {{particular}} not to turn around again without lowering her pistol.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{unless you}} wish to draw it out. She told me, some time ago, why she placed it in your name; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{that there would be}} no difficulty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] <b>I</b> said. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of {{the plan}} which I had made. [...] "Will you come with me?" [...] I said, when I had done, [...] "or will you creep back into the hut and bid me farewell?" ...|$|R

60|$|Marian {{preserved}} {{her composure}} while I described {{my interview with}} Mr. Kyrle. But her face became troubled when I spoke next {{of the men who}} had followed me from the lawyer's office, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of the discovery of Sir Percival's return.|$|R
60|$|I couldn't kill her--not {{at least}} until the last moment; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so, and that I loved her, and that until death came, I would live and fight for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then--I always {{expected}} to tell you--I {{did have a}} fancy for that girl, for Miss Vostrand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so. It's like something that never happened. She wouldn't have me. That's all." ...|$|E
