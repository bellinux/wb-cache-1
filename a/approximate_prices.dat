40|$|We study a large {{economy in}} which firms cannot compute exact {{solutions}} to the non-linear equations that characterize the equilibrium price at which they can sell future output. Instead, firms use polynomial expansions to <b>approximate</b> <b>prices.</b> The precision with which they can compute prices is endogenous and depends on the overall level of supply. At the same time, firms' individual supplies, and thus aggregate supply, depend on the precision with which they <b>approximate</b> <b>prices.</b> This interrelation between supply and price forecast induces multiple equilibria, with inefficiently low output, in economies that otherwise have a unique, efficient equilibrium. Moreover, exogenous parameter changes, which would increase output were there no computational frictions, can diminish agents' ability to approximate future prices, and reduce output. Our model therefore accommodates the intuition that interventions, such as unprecedented quantitative easing, can put agents into "uncharted territory"...|$|E
40|$|Using tools from {{spectral}} analysis, singular {{and regular}} perturbation theory, we develop a systematic method for analytically computing the <b>approximate</b> <b>price</b> of a derivative-asset. The payoff of the derivative-asset may be path-dependent. Additionally, the process underlying the derivative may exhibit killing (i. e. jump to default) {{as well as}} combined local/nonlocal stochastic volatility. The nonlocal component of volatility is multiscale, {{in the sense that}} it is driven by one fast-varying and one slow-varying factor. The flexibility of our modeling framework is contrasted by the simplicity of our method. We reduce the derivative pricing problem to that of solving a single eigenvalue equation. Once the eigenvalue equation is solved, the <b>approximate</b> <b>price</b> of a derivative can be calculated formulaically. To illustrate our method, we calculate the <b>approximate</b> <b>price</b> of three derivative-assets: a vanilla option on a defaultable stock, a path-dependent option on a non-defaultable stock, and a bond in a short-rate model. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{classical}} Taylor series techniques, {{we develop}} a unified approach to pricing and implied volatility for European-style options {{in a general}} local-stochastic volatility setting. Our price approximations require only a normal CDF and our implied volatility approximations are fully explicit (ie, they require no special functions, no infinite series and no numerical integration). As such, <b>approximate</b> <b>prices</b> can be computed as efficiently as Black-Scholes prices, and approximate implied volatilities can be computed nearly instantaneously. ...|$|E

Moreover, using the <b>approximate</b> <b>prices</b> {{as a control}} variate, we achieve substantial variance reduction in Monte Carlo simulation. ...|$|E

40|$|We present {{variance}} reduction {{methods for}} Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate European and Asian {{options in the}} context of multiscale stochastic volatility models. European option price approximations, obtained from singular and regular perturbation analysis [Fouque J P, Papanicolaou G, Sircar R and Solna K 2003 Multiscale stochastic volatility asymptotics SIAM J. Multiscale Modeling and Simulation 2], are used in importance sampling techniques, and their efficiencies are compared. Then we investigate the problem of pricing arithmetic average Asian options (AAOs) by Monte Carlo simulations. A two-step strategy is proposed to reduce the variance where geometric average Asian options (GAOs) are used as control variates. Due to the lack of analytical formulas for GAOs under stochastic volatility models, it is then necessary to consider efficient Monte Carlo methods to estimate the unbiased means of GAOs. The second step consists in deriving formulas for <b>approximate</b> <b>prices</b> based on perturbation techniques, and in computing GAOs by using importance sampling. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of our method. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} fast drift <b>approximated</b> <b>pricing</b> in the BGM model (Brace, G¸atarek and Musiela, 1997). It is a significant addition to the predictor-corrector drift approximation method introduced by Hunter, Jäckel and Joshi (HJJ, 2001). HJJ use the drift approximation only to speed up their Monte Carlo by reducing it to single time-step simulation. We show that much more efficient numerical methods (e. g. finite differences) may be used {{at the cost of}} a minor additional assumption, separability. We also present a new drift approximation and propose a method to measure the accuracy of a drift approximation. This measure shows that our drift approximation is more accurate than the one of HJJ.

40|$|Walrasian {{equilibrium}} {{prices can}} be said to coordinate markets: They support a welfare optimal allocation in which each buyer is buying bundle of goods that is individually most preferred. However, this clean story has two caveats. First, the prices alone are not sufficient to coordinate the market, and buyers may need to select among their most preferred bundles in a coordinated way to find a feasible allocation. Second, we don't in practice expect to encounter exact equilibrium prices tailored to the market, but instead only <b>approximate</b> <b>prices,</b> somehow encoding "distributional" information about the market. How well do prices work to coordinate markets when tie-breaking is not coordinated, and they encode only distributional information? We answer this question. First, we provide a genericity condition such that for buyers with Matroid Based Valuations, overdemand with respect to equilibrium prices is at most 1, independent of the supply of goods, even when tie-breaking is done in an uncoordinated fashion. Second, we provide learning-theoretic results that show that such prices are robust to changing the buyers in the market, so long as all buyers are sampled from the same (unknown) distribution...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{application}} of perturbation methods in developing and solving credit and equity derivative pricing models. Chapter II proposes a uniﬁed framework for pricing credit and equity derivatives that incorporates stochastic volatility, default intensity, and interest rates. It is demonstrated that the model can be jointly calibrated to the bond and equity options of a same company. It is observed that the model implied CDS spread matches the market CDS spread. Chapter III studies the pricing of convertible bonds and barrier and lookback options {{in the framework of}} Chapter II. By applying perturbation methods, the author is able to reduce the dimension of the free-boundary problem for pricing convertible bonds and to solve the corresponding Dirichlet and mixed (Dirichlet and Neumann) boundary-value problems for <b>approximate</b> <b>prices</b> of barrier and lookback options. Chapter IV extends Linetsky’s negative-power intensity model [29] by introducing a fast evolving factor. It is shown that the resulting approximation for derivatives prices are Linetsky’s prices with a “Greek” correction term, and the approximations for the double barrier options prices are derived. Chapter V studies stochastic parameter extensions of a top-down model proposed in [14] for multi-name credit derivatives, where the default process is a time-changed birth process. The calibration exercise shows that the introduction of stochastic parameters brings in more ﬂexibility and improves ﬁtting the market data...|$|E

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to …nd an <b>approximate</b> <b>price</b> of a swaption in Affine Term Structure Models. Our approach {{is based on the}} derivation of approximate dynamics in which the volatility of the Forward Swap Rate is itself an affine function of the factors. Hence we remain in the Affine framework and well known results on transforms and transform inversion can be used to obtain swaption prices in ways similar to bond options (i. e. caplets). We demonstrate that we can also obtain a closed form formula for the <b>approximate</b> <b>price</b> which is based on square-root dynamics for the swap rate. The latter approximation is extremely fast while remaining accurate. The method can be easily generalized to price options on coupon bonds. Computational time compares favorably with other approximation methods. Numerical results {{on the quality of the}} approximation are excellent. Our results show that in Affine models, analogously to the LIBOR Market Model, LIBOR and Swap rates are driven by approximately the same type of (in this case affine) dynamics...|$|R
