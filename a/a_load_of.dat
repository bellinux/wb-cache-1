5|$|There is scant {{record of}} the ship's {{movements}} under any of her later names. The Los Angeles Times reports her arrival at West Coast ports as Seisho Maru at least twice. In March 1930, the ship arrived at Tacoma, Washington, from Singapore to pick up <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> logs for export. Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War II, Pan Gulf {{frequently}} sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic, {{as well as}} some in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Between April and September 1942, Pan Gulf {{made two}} roundtrips from the U.S. to Liverpool. In September, the cargo ship sailed from New York to the Caribbean to take on <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> bauxite in early November, and then sailed on to Galveston, Texas, before returning to New York in mid-February 1943.|$|E
5|$|At New York, West Lianga took on <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> 6,882 tons of {{materiel}} for the United States Army and a deck-load of 32 {{trucks and}} departed for France in a convoy.

After voyage repairs, she loaded another 6,685 tons of cargo for the Quartermaster Corps and departed for Europe on 3 November. West Lianga was en route to France when the Armistice that ended fighting was signed on 11 November. West Lianga delivered her cargo to Saint-Nazaire and took on <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> 1,700 tons for delivery to the United States.

50|$|In {{addition}} to limits, test procedure has certain finer points too.

She arrived at Freetown on 25 November and called at Bathurst and Takoradi over the next two months before returning to Trinidad on 31 January 1943.

5|$|Cofresí's sudden {{success was}} an oddity, {{nearly a century}} {{after the end of}} the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint {{governmental}} efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which had turned the Caribbean into a haven for pirates attacking shipments from the region's Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced Cofresí to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often there. This base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola.|$|E

After West Ekonk took on <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> steel and scrap, the ship sailed to Halifax, where she joined convoy HX 99 in sailing for Liverpool on 26 December 1940. On 30 December, the ship's compass went out but West Ekonk was able to remain in her station in the convoy, and safely arrived at Liverpool on 11 January 1941, despite sailing through a gale with sleet storms on 4 January. In his notes for the convoy, P. E. Parker, the convoy's commodore, singled out H. MacKinnon, master of West Ekonk, for praise of his seamanship in keeping West Ekonk in the convoy without a working compass.|$|E

In December 1920, Rivadavia participated in ceremonies that marked the 400th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} the Strait of Magellan.

Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington.
