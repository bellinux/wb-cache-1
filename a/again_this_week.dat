'If it weren't for the jelly, and the natural {{affections}} always engendered by shoemaking, I think I should almost feel inclined to cut you off with a shilling, Artie, my boy--to cut you off with a shilling. Well, Artie, I'm quite convalescent now (don't you call it? I'm afraid of my long shoemaker's words before you, nowadays, you've grown so literary; for I suppose parsons are more literary than even shoemakers). I'm quite convalescent now, and I think, my boy, I must get to work <b>again</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> and have no more of your expensive soups and jellies. If I didn't keep a sharp look-out upon you, Artie, lad, I believe you'd starve yourself outright up there at Oxford to pamper your poor old useless father here with luxuries he's never been accustomed to in his whole life.' ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, on {{that same}} Thursday afternoon, Arthur Berkeley had gone up from Oxford by the fast train to Paddington, as was his weekly wont, and had dived quickly {{down one of the}} small lanes that open out from the {{left-hand}} side of Praed Street. He walked along it for a little way, humming an air to himself as he went, and then stopped at last in front of a small, decent brick house, with a clean muslin blind across the window (clean muslin forms a notable object in most London back streets), and a printed card hanging from the central pane, bearing the inscription, 'G. Berkeley, Working Shoemaker.--The Trade supplied with Ready-closed Uppers.' At the window a beaming face was watching for his appearance, and Arthur said to himself as he saw it through the curtain, 'The dear old Progenitor's looking better <b>again</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> God bless him!' In a moment he had opened the door, and greeted his father in the old boyish fashion, with an honest kiss on either cheek. They had kissed one another so whenever they met from Arthur's childhood upward; and the Oxford curate had never felt himself grown too much of a man to keep up a habit which seemed to him by far the most sacred thing in his whole existence.|$|E

For another job, recording a song for the soundtrack of German comedy Hanni & Nanni, the girls had to perform their favourite song in front of the client again. Sarah and Julia were the ones who got the job and therefore recorded a song. On the following day, the girls had to perform country-songs with backing bands in so-called honky-tonks and had to collect money for their show. Therefore, the girls were split into groups. The group who earned the most consisted of Katrin, Yonca and Diba.

Non-nominees were required to pick the nominated housemates they would want to help by kicking a football into a 'goal' placed for each of the six nominees. Daniel was picked by Maris, Fifth by Fourth, Joshua by Vickie, Loisa by Cheridel, and Nichole by Manolo. Only Jane had no partner. In the Insta Save challenges, under one hour, each pairs had to shoot a table tennis ball to their partners, thread a table of needles, and form the 'SAVE' word using puzzle pieces.

Alison welcomes {{everyone}} to a tailgate party, where each player will have three minutes in a tent filled with typical tailgating foods - the last thing the contestants should be putting in their bodies. Without knowing how the other players choose, the contestants must decide whether or not they will eat, and whoever eats the most calories wins immunity at the next weigh-in. It's the biggest risk and the biggest reward thus far. However, the winning player's weight will still count towards their team's total, and if they gain weight <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> they will lose immunity. Also, the Red Line is once <b>again</b> in play <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> Woody is up first, and despite some initial hesitation, eats 378 calories worth of meatballs. Scott has a few meatballs, for a total of 270 calories, but has a hard time getting them down. JJ is overwhelmed by temptation, but remembers how terrible he felt on Day 1 and never wants to feel that way again. Blake also refuses to eat, as does Rondalee, who actually drops to the ground and does burpees for three minutes instead. Sonya, Lori, Gina, Damien and Jordan also resist temptation, while Rob decides to go for it and eats 602 calories, taking the lead. Toma is the last to enter the tent, and while he manages to eat a whopping 852 calories, his body can barely take it after eating so cleanly for five weeks. In the end, it was worth the stomachache, as Toma wins immunity for the week! ...|$|R

5000|$|On 9 April 2010 Barker {{claimed the}} European title with a {{unanimous}} points victory over Affif Belghecham of France.

[...] The fight against Belghecham, the reigning French and EU champion, {{proved to be the}} toughest of his career so far with the Frenchman pushing Barker all the way. [...] Barker, now the holder of three championship belts, decided to vacate the Commonwealth title and set his sights upon defending the British and European belts against Matthew Macklin, whose world title ambitions did not materialise, later in the year in an eagerly anticipated fight dubbed the 'Battle of Britain'. The fight was {{to be one of the}} showcases of Frank Warrens 'Magnificent Seven' boxing event to be shown live on SKY PPV on 18 September 2010. [...] The fight however had to be called off following the re-occurrence of a hip injury whilst sparring for the contest meaning that Barker had to pull out of the contest and relinquish the title. Barkers trainer Tony Sims said of the decision to pull him out of the fight [...] "Everyone knows he had a hip operation a few months back and the day before yesterday (31 August 2010) he broke down for a second time.

5000|$|At the weigh-in, it's time to {{see whether}} the Blue Team can sweep Week 7, or whether the other teams can prove they can do it on their own. The Red Line is also in play <b>again</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> meaning the player on the losing team with the lowest {{percentage}} of weight loss will automatically be sent home. The Red Team is up first, and it's time to find out how they did without Dolvett. Rob steps on the scale and loses nine pounds. At 396 pounds, he's excited to say goodbye to the 400s and can't believe he weighed 501 when he first looked at the Biggest Loser website. Jordan and Scott both lose seven pounds, followed by Blake who loses five, and also falls into [...] "one"derland. The Red Team's total is 28 pounds, or 2.39% of their combined weight. The Blue Team is up next and needs to lose more than 20 pounds. Lori is up first and loses five pounds, followed by Jackie who loses a mere two. Once again, it's all up to Damien, who must lose more than 13 pounds to keep his team safe. Damien steps on the scale and loses five, meaning the Blue Team lost a total of 12 pounds, 1.42%. Jessie is upset and thinks he needs to reevaluate how he's training his team. The White Team is up last, and must lose more than 20 pounds, despite only having Jen for one day. JJ drops a solid seven, while Toma and Woody only lose four. Rondalee is up next and posts just two pounds, which means Sonya has to lose at least four to save her team. Sonya steps on the scale… and loses six pounds! She is elated {{to have been able to}} pull through for her team. Their grand total is 23 pounds, 1.62%. This means that despite their challenge win, the Blue Team has lost and must face the Red Line. Sadly, it's Jackie's time to leave the ranch, as she only lost 0.79% of her body weight. She is at peace with that, and is so proud to go home to be a role model to her two girls. Now the Blue Team is down to two players... what will happen to them next week?

40|$|My {{plan for}} this talk is to clarify our {{understandings}} of hate crimes as a concept, to outline the FBI data on disability hate crimes, {{and then to}} develop various explanations of this data. But before I do this I want to set the scene. When I think of disability hate crimes I am reminded of the song “Mister Cellophane ” from the musical Chicago. Disability hate crimes could be regarded as ‘cellophane crimes’: people walk right through them, look right through them, and never know they are there. In Somerville, Massachusetts on October 24 th, 2 deaf girls were raped by gang members. One of these girls had cerebral palsy. A few weeks later then on Saturday 9 th of November, another deaf girl was raped, again by gang members. <b>Again,</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> another deaf woman was raped in the Boston area. While I don’t wish to examine any of these cases in particular, I want to raise the question: when the circumstances indicate that such crimes may be neither random nor circumstantial, why has no one suggested these may be hate crimes? I suspect {{it has something to}} do with the absence of disability awareness in critical approaches to society. In the words of Lennard Davis (1995 : 1) disability is “the missing term in the race, class gender triad”. As a result of this absence, disability was not a category which has been automatically included in discussions of hate crime. Even today, many discussions of hate crime completely ignore the issue of disability. For instance, Punishing Hate: Bias Crimes Under American Law by Frederick Lawrence (1999), acknowledges that bias crimes occur on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation and gender but notably omits disability. Before I pursue this argument, however, I want to clarify what I mean by “hate crime”...|$|E
