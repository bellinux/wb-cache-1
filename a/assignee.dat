5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his <b>assignee,</b> authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the Assistant Official <b>Assignee,</b> James Walter Davy Ambrose (who {{was later}} {{appointed}} a High Court Judge), to study law, Choor Singh enrolled as an external {{student at the}} University of London, passing the matriculation examination and intermediate LL.B. examination. In 1948 he was appointed a coroner, and the following year was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. Following law studies at Gray's Inn on a government scholarship, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. He was appointed a district judge in 1960 and a judge of the Supreme Court in 1963. Especially noted for his criminal judgments, Singh was the first Singapore judge to impose the death penalty on a woman.|$|E
5|$|In Elizabethan England, music {{printing}} was {{regulated by}} two royal patents {{issued by the}} queen: one for metrical psalters (psalms set to music) and one for all other types of music and music paper. The patent-holders thus held a monopoly—only they or their assignees could legally print music. After printer John Day's death in 1584, the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees, {{who were members of}} the Stationers' Company. The more general one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575. Despite the monopoly, Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavours; their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur failed to sell and was a financial disaster. After Tallis died in 1585, Byrd continued holding the patent, producing works with his <b>assignee,</b> Thomas East. The monopoly expired in 1596, prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley {{to take advantage of the}} resulting power vacuum.|$|E

The district judges were divided on whether to grant the motion or not, and therefore the question went to the Supreme Court on a certificate of division.|$|R

5|$|The Assistant Official <b>Assignee,</b> James Walter Davy Ambrose (later a High Court Judge), advised Choor Singh {{to study}} law. Singh read law books in his leisure time and began saving money to study law in England. This {{proved to be}} unnecessary; {{following}} {{a change in the}} rules, he was able to enrol as an external student at the University of London and passed the matriculation examination and, in 1948, the intermediate LL.B. examination. However, he could not be called to the Bar as a barrister as he did not have time to keep the required dining terms. On 20 May 1948, he was appointed a coroner. In December 1949, Singh was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. He continued his law studies at Gray's Inn, and in 1953 was granted leave on a government scholarship to dine at Gray's Inn. After making four trips in two years, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. In 1958, he was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the <b>assignee</b> and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E

25|$|In {{situations}} where the liquidation value of the assets exceeds a secured creditor's lien, the <b>assignee</b> is not normally required to obtain the consent of a secured creditor or any other creditor prior to the assignment process. Cooperation of the secured creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset. An <b>assignee</b> in practice may obtain {{the consent of the}} secured creditors in advance of the assignment to ensure that the <b>assignee</b> can liquidate the asset or assets in a timely manner without a secured party stopping or holding up the assignment process. Secured party consent in this case is optional, not necessary.|$|E

25|$|The claims {{process is}} similar to a {{standard}} bankruptcy action in which creditors submit claims to the <b>assignee</b> for review and acceptance. The acceptance and vetting of claims is an important process to ensure that no one creditor has overstated their claim. There are rare occasions in which an <b>assignee</b> may issue a non-cash dividend as part of the overall dividend to creditors on their claims, but a dividend of this type is not common. If all the creditors are made whole, shareholders would then have a claim on the remainder of the dividend. This holds true only if there are no other classes of equity that have priority senior to the shareholders.|$|E

25|$|The {{dividend}} is {{hopefully the}} payout that the <b>assignee</b> issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted {{and all the}} assets have been sold. The <b>assignee</b> hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are {{in the form of}} cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate.|$|E
40|$|International Assignment is at {{the centre}} of this study. Drawing on data from {{interviews}} with 31 Chinese <b>assignees</b> working for multinational companies in different cultural contexts, it explores their perceptions of international experience. Most literature concerning international assignments focuses on <b>assignees</b> from Western countries. By comparison, <b>assignees</b> from emerging economies such as China remain an under-researched group despite a rapid growth of multinational companies from these newly emerging economies. Moreover, {{much of the research}} often takes a unilateral perspective (such as either motivation, experience or career) lacking theoretical integration and failing to investigate the complexity of international assignments. Hence, to address this gap, this study adopts an integrated, multi-dimensional theoretical framework incorporating motivation, experience and career capital. It uses a qualitative research methodology based on in-depth interviews and is located within an interpretive paradigm in which individual meaning, action, social relationships and interactions are paramount. The study begins by focusing on motivation for accepting an international assignment. Motivation is identified as a multi-faceted, complex and interdependent decisionmaking process. Building career capital, which leads to personal growth, is the ultimate individual expectation from a foreign posting. International experience is then explored, focusing on issues associated with adjustment, satisfaction and social integration. While some initial expectations are fulfilled, other factors become more relevant over time and affect individual perceptions of the value of international assignments. This emphasises the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of the overseas experience. Specific attention is also given to the career capital development of international <b>assignees.</b> The findings offer new insights to the international assignment literature showing that while Chinese <b>assignees</b> appreciate the experience of international assignments, in contrast to much of the Western literature, they consider it has little impact on their future careers. This is explained largely in terms of cultural factors (generally the relevance to Chinese career development), as well as the particular nature of Chinese multinational companies. In the last part, the concept of career capital is examined integrating findings on motivation and experience. Taking an overall perspective, the context of assignees’ career capital development is analysed focusing on the relevance of factors within individual, organisational and social domains. Two new themes, knowing-when and knowingwhere, are also added to the existing understanding of three ways of knowing. The contribution of this study is thus both theoretical and empirical. It extends the knowledge of motivation, experience and career capital, utilising an under-researched, yet increasingly important, sample of Chinese <b>assignees</b> working for multinational companies in Western countries. The proposed contextual model provides implications for future research such as comparative studies of international <b>assignees</b> from different cultures or <b>assignees</b> on different types of postings (e. g., long-term, short-term and frequent flyer). Future investigations could also focus on the specifications of contextual factors for international assignments and career development of international <b>assignees...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of the family, and related issues {{associated}} with short-term international assignments from the assignees' perspective. Conceptually our study utilizes discourse analysis set within a social constructionist framework to understand these issues better. Our research is a longitudinal case study which encompasses 22 interviews with short-term <b>assignees</b> employed by a US-based MNC. Despite the physical absence of the family/spouse on short-term assignments, a number of family related concerns emerge in our study. First, ‘single’ <b>assignees,</b> as well as married <b>assignees,</b> have family related concerns. Second, extended, as well as immediate family, are influential in the assignment process. Third, long-distance family support is crucial in the wake of assignment-imposed separation. Finally, there are significant family issues associated with repatriation in the aftermath of a short-term assignment...|$|R
40|$|Using patents on {{environmental}} road transport technologies filed by 355 <b>assignees</b> {{over the period}} 1999 – 2010, the paper investigates under what conditions the European environmental transport policy portfolio and the intrinsic characteristics of assignees' knowledge boost worldwide green patent production. The findings suggest that post-tax fuel prices, environmental vehicle taxes, CO 2 standards and European emission standards, introduced into the empirical model through an innovative methodology based on Self-Organising Maps (SOM) (Kohonen, 1990, 2001), positively influence the creation of environmental inventions. Most importantly, {{the paper highlights that}} <b>assignees</b> anticipate the introduction of regulatory instruments (i. e. European emission standards and CO 2 targets) by filing patents before the effective implementation of regulations when legislation is announced. Furthermore, the paper provides evidence that in a technological space (which measures the applicants' technological proximity), closely located <b>assignees</b> enhance their patent output through the exploitation of technological knowledge produced by others. This means that the greater the proximity between <b>assignees,</b> the higher their likelihood of gaining advantage from this potential spillover pool. Finally, the paper observes that dynamic changes in assignees' patent portfolios spur inventive performances...|$|R
