Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as energy harvesting [...] and understanding snoring. The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or steady response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body’s dynamic (typically vibrational) response.

These disciplines are: the unsteady aerodynamics, the aeroelasticity and the servo-controls applied on an aircraft. An aspect of the <b>aeroservoelasticity</b> is the conversion of unsteady aerodynamic forces from the frequency domain (aeroelasticity) into Laplace domain (<b>aeroservoelasticity).</b> Flexible aircraft structure is modeled by finite elements methods by use of classical finite elements NASTRAN software.

The application of modern control design techniques, simulation and optimization procedures to aeroservoelastic systems require the aeroservoelastic equations of motion to be transformed into a first-order, time-domain (state-space) form.

This paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} Multibody System Dynamics (MSD) coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for the aeroelastic analysis of detailed aircraft models undergoing arbitrary free flight motion. Computational <b>AeroServoElasticity</b> (CASE) requires the concurrent modeling of rather different aspects of aeromechanics, including rigid body dynamics, structural flexibility, fluid flow, servo-mechanisms for actuators.

Another advantage is the great flexibility in setting up the model: the designer can indeed choose the most appropriate tools, trading accuracy for computational costs, demanding for higher-order fidelity methods only when simplified ones cannot be applied, or their validation is required.

40|$|Aeroelasticity is the {{discipline}} of the aeronautical engineering that studies the vibration of the aircraft flexible structure as affected by the surrounding air. The aeroelastic behaviour of an aircraft depends basically of four major inputs: structure, inertia, aerodynamics, and flight control systems (<b>aeroservoelasticity).</b> The classical approach considers linear models for the structure, and {{does not include the}} effect on structural nonlinearities like freeplay/hysteresis on control surfaces, hardening/softening of the structure with high deformations, and so on. These nonlinearities can modify the classical aeroelastic behaviour of the structure by introducing additional vibration-type instabilities like Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) or Chaotic response. These undamped oscillations, although not catastrophic, have an important influence on the fatigue life of the structure. This report supplies a generic overview of the effect of the concentrated structural nonlinearities on the vibration of the aircraft flexible structure, and describes the current theoretical and experimental methodologies that the aeronautical industry performs to take into account these nonlinearities at the aircraft design stage.

40|$|Regarding the {{regulation}} of weakly damped aeroelastic structures {{by means of the}} primary flight controls (PFC), the present contribution focusses on a sophisticated robust controller design method, to achieve the required functio-nality. Generally, the outlined approach is premised on ei-genstructure assignment. Enhancements promise effective integration of miscellaneous potentially competing objec-tive specifications either in time or frequency domain as well as parametric requirements. Due to the infinitive set of flight conditions and fuel configurations the underly-ing aeroservoelastic plant consists of a linear multivariable multi–model system. Technical feasibility, parametric and dynamic uncertainties as well as architectural constraints, e. g. the number of available sensors lead to a robust out-put feedback controller. Principally the proposed method is well known from flight control design and modal de-coupling. But in contrast, the constrained simultaneous ro-bust eigenvalue stabilisation represents the primary objec-tive at the current application. Since the intrinsic controller calculation is implemented as multiobjective optimisation task, proper optimisation criteria are defined, which incor-porate the aeroservoelastic performance specifications into the design procedure.

One {{of the goals of}} ASE research is to provide active gust load alleviation in aircraft to improve ride quality, minimize airframe fatigue, and increase performance. The goal of this research is to develop a robust aeroelastic (AE) predictive model for a wing section that represents a typical flexible wing in flight, and which will be used as a platform for developing ASE controllers. The various components of this research, including an unsteady aerodynamic module, a structural module, and a gust module, have been individually developed and validated with experiments. The experimental facility, comprising of a pitch-plunge free vibration apparatus, a real-time gust sniffing sensor, and an oscillating vane gust generator, are designed and developed at Texas A&M as test beds for current and future ASE research. Both the experiments and predictive model are used to explore nonlinear behavior of the system response. For example, the research has led to experimentally derived bifurcation diagrams depicting possible responses. The limit cycle oscillations (LCO) observed in experiments are captured by the predictive model. The AE model allows for parametric study of wing response on various system features such as nonlinear structural stiffness, nonlinear Coulomb damping, mass imbalance, and other design features.

As part of this effort, a nonlinear quasi 1 -dimensional model of the 2 -dimensional bifurcated mixed compression supersonic inlet is being developed. The model utilizes computational fluid dynamics for both the supersonic and subsonic diffusers. The oblique shocks are modeled utilizing compressible flow equations. This model also implements variable geometry required to control the normal shock position. The model is flexible and {{can also be utilized}} to simulate other mixed compression supersonic inlet designs. The model was validated both in time and in the frequency domain against the legacy LArge Perturbation INlet code, which has been previously verified using test data. This legacy code written in FORTRAN is quite extensive and complex in terms of the amount of software and number of subroutines. Further, the legacy code is not suitable for closed loop feedback controls design, and the simulation environment is not amenable to systems integration. Therefore, a solution is to develop an innovative, more simplified, mixed compression inlet model with the same steady state and dynamic performance as the legacy code that also can be used for controls design. The new nonlinear dynamic model is implemented in MATLAB Simulink. This environment allows easier development of linear models for controls design for shock positioning.

40|$|Complex aeroservoelastic and {{mechatronic}} systems imply {{interaction between}} multidisciplinary or multifield subcomponents, whose dynamics {{are characterized by}} problem- and fieldspecific time scales and frequency ranges. As opposed to what is usually termed monolithic approach to the simulation of coupled problems, where a single formulation (and software solver) directly models the entire problems, the co-simulation approach allows to exploit state-of-art formulations for specific fields by coupling them as appropriate to establish the required interaction between the subcomponents. The interaction problem between the different and even incompatible interfaces of subcomponent domains can be split in spatial and temporal. This work focuses on the latter aspect. In fact, when subdomains require different time scales to achieve the desired trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, multirate methods {{can be used to}} avoid the need of a subdomain solver to comply with excessively stringent requirements resulting from another one. Many multirate methods are designed for monoblock systems and used in single-disciplinary simulations (e. g. electric networks). Their application to co-simulation setups may be not straightforward. A key problem in co-simulation, especially when stability and free response of a system are addressed, as in <b>aeroservoelasticity,</b> is related to the numerical stability of the coupled solution process. This work investigates the linear stability properties of a multirate formulation called 'Double Extrapolation' (DE) consisting in integrating each subproblem using second-order accurate, L-stable Backward Difference Formulas (BDF) while each subdomain extrapolates the behavior of the other one. It has been chosen because it allows to eliminate most of the idle time of each subdomain solver. The resulting performance gains are illustrated by applying the proposed method to the simulation of a complex aeroservoelastic system consisting in the aeroelastic model of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT), developed using the general-purpose multibody formulation implemented in the free solver MBDyn, and a dynamic model of the electric generator, modeled in the free general-purpose block-diagram simulation environment ScicosLab.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} Rotary-Wing <b>Aeroservoelasticity</b> {{approach}} to the modeling, analysis {{and control of the}} blade-sailing phenomenon in the helicopter-ship dynamic interface (DI), based on the identification, response evaluation and control of flow and ship motion induced loads, during the engagement/disengagement flight regimes, in order to establish some principles for the design and safe operation of shipboard rotorcraft systems. The nonlinear aeroelastic analysis revealed that the nonlinearity due to large flapping deflections and to the centrifugal forces is not relevant for normal operating conditions, whereas the nonlinear effects due to the flapping stops in articulated rotors influence significantly the blade-sailing vibrations. These nonlinear effects related to the stops can be tackled with approximate stiffness functions. The nonlinear analysis confirmed that hingeless rotor blade-sailing vibrations are lower than that of the articulated rotor, however, the differences are small for rotors with similar structural/geometric characteristics. The blade-sailing phenomenon in the DI and the flapping response during engagement/disengagement shipboard operations can be analyzed trough an oscillator system with nonlinear stiffness related to the droop and flap stops and time-varying coefficients related to the undisturbed flow velocity and to the parameters of the proposed active proportional-derivative individual blade control (PD-IBC). The aeroelastic analysis also showed that blade sailing is a cooperative phenomenon. Though the mean flow vertical velocity gradient across the rotor be the single most important factor, the combination of horizontal wind velocities, fluctuating flow vertical velocities, gravity and ship motion effects may give rise to excessive flapping vibrations. The proposed active proportional-derivative state feedback individual blade control (PD-IBC) can obtain blade-sailing flapping vibration reduction of 30 % for shipboard articulated rotors at moderate wind-over-deck (WOD) conditions/advance ratios, without monitoring the DI environment, and a reduction greater than 40 % if combined with shipboard rotor plant modifications, involving an increase of the blade flapwise stiffness and an aerodynamic design of the ship flight deck, considering the current blade pitch input limits of the actuators. Therefore, the implementation of active feedback aeroelastic control methods {{may be one of the}} most important measures for blade-sailing mitigation in the DI...|$|E

The interaction between an aircraft's structural dynamics, unsteady aerodynamics and flight control system is known as <b>aeroservoelasticity.</b> The problem can occur because the control system sensors are of sufficient bandwidth to sense the structural vibrations {{as well as the}} rigid-body motion of the aircraft. This sensed structural vibration can result in further excitation of the structure through both aerodynamic and inertial excitation, leading to a potential closed-loop instability. At present, such an unstable interaction is prevented by the inclusion of notch filters within the feedback path which have a detrimental effect on the aircraft's rigid-body performance. The current clearance procedure is restricted by a poor understanding of the array of complex issues involved. The aim of the project was to develop a clearer understanding of the interactions between system components leading to a reduction in the clearance requirements. Work has concentrated on the effects of system nonlinearities and on the digital nature of modem control systems. A major source of nonlinearities within the control system are the servo-hydraulic actuators. Through detailed actuator modelling confirmed by rig testing of actual hardware, these nonlinearities are analysed and a method for predicting the response of the actuators in the presence of two input signals proposed. As a result, it is demonstrated that an unstable structural oscillation would cause a limit-cycle oscillation as opposed to an unbounded response. Through nonlinear system theory the criteria for the existence of such limit-cycles are obtained, enabling them to be predicted and therefore prevented. Consideration of the true nonlinear nature of the aeroservoelastic system has enabled an alternative design and clearance procedure to be proposed which reduces the attenuation requirements of the structural-mode filters whilst ensuring satisfactory aircraft performance even in the presence of modelling errors. This design procedure is demonstrated on both a model of the aircraft system and a simple test system enabling verification of the nonlinear analysis and comparison between the current and proposed alternative procedures. As a result, it is demonstrated that consideration of the true nonlinear nature of the aeroservoelastic interaction has the potential for allowing a significant reduction in structural filter attenuation requirements. Consequently, a reduction in the phase lag due to the filters is possible resulting in an improvement in closed-loop system performance whilst ensuring the safe operation of the aircraft...|$|E
