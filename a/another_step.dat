5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice; it was <b>another</b> <b>step</b> in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which {{had made it}} impossible for one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement in each of the others. He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
5|$|The {{reception}} of The Desert Fox in Britain was enthusiastic: the book went through eight editions in a year. Young's biography was <b>another</b> <b>step</b> {{in the development}} of the Rommel myth, with Rommel emerging as an active, if not a leading, plotter. Speidel contributed as well, starting, from the early 1950s, to bring up Rommel's and his own role in the plot, thus boosting Speidel's suitability for a future role in the new military force of the Federal Republic, the Bundeswehr, and then in NATO.|$|E

5000|$|Substitution. Most leagues allow {{unlimited}} substitutions {{while the}} ball is out of play. Some allow live substitution while the game is in progress, provided that one player leaves the arena before <b>another</b> <b>steps</b> on. A minority of leagues require substitution in shifts.|$|R
60|$|A dispute or {{discussion}} {{seemed to}} arise among them, for {{they all looked}} up from their reading together, {{and one of the}} three, who had been glancing over the shoulder of <b>another,</b> <b>stepped</b> back to explain or illustrate some action by his gestures.|$|R
5|$|This was {{repeated}} the following season, {{and so in}} 1971 Andover took <b>another</b> <b>step</b> up and joined the Southern League. Now competing against teams from an even wider area spanning almost the entire width of the country (ranging from Bideford {{in the west to}} Bury Town in the east) and in some cases with a larger budget and fanbase, competition was always tough with the club generally finishing in {{the bottom half of the}} table. The highest position the club reached at this level was the sixth place reached in 1987–88 and again in 1991–92.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so <b>another</b> <b>step</b> was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was <b>another</b> <b>step</b> in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E

5000|$|Angels & Enemies was {{released}} to positive critical acclaim. FMV Magazine's Dan Jenko described the record as [...] "an excellent return for Sound of Guns: one {{that not only}} gives their die-hard fans the crowd-pleasing anthems they wanted, but also provides <b>another</b> <b>stepping</b> stone {{as they attempt to}} break into the mainstream fold".|$|R
50|$|The {{curriculum}} includes {{guidelines for}} swim teaching, logistics, venue management, instructors’ criteria, training details of skill sets and graduation criteria. Of the 21 {{steps in the}} manual, water familiarisation features in eight; <b>another</b> eight <b>steps</b> relate to acquisition of different components of swim skills; three steps focus on rescue techniques and <b>another</b> two <b>steps</b> are about acquiring competence as a survival swimmer.|$|R
5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took <b>another</b> <b>step</b> towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E

25|$|Through theology, literature, and indulgences, purgatory became {{central to}} late medieval {{religion}} and became associated with indulgences and other penitential practices, such as fasting. This was <b>another</b> <b>step</b> {{in the development}} of this doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} use of {{anesthesia}} became established, surgeries involving healthy tissues involved great pain. Infection from surgery was reduced {{by the introduction of}} sterile techniques and disinfectants.

50|$|The outer sanctum is {{connected}} to the middle sanctum via <b>another</b> <b>steps,</b> a candi bentar gateway marks the entrance into the middle sanctum. The middle sanctum contains several pavilion mainly to support the ritual process in the inner sanctum. The Gedong Sinub Wastra is a storage shed for offering paraphernalia. A piasan pedanda is a small pavilion used by the priest to make their offerings, and an additional storage. A kitchen is also located in the middle sanctum.|$|R
60|$|This {{decided the}} matter, {{and the body}} was laid aside, while <b>another</b> <b>stepped</b> forward and sponged the gun. At that moment Raoul found leisure to walk a yard or two toward the rear, in order to {{ascertain}} if the cover of Ghita were sufficient. The girl was on her knees, lost to all around her; though, could he have read her heart, he would have found it divided between entreaties to the Deity and love for himself.|$|R
25|$|In October 2015, the European Union and Liechtenstein {{signed a}} tax {{agreement}} {{to ensure the}} automatic exchange of financial information in case of tax disputes.

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>step</b> in {{his career}} became a reality after his tenure with Pearson when he was named general manager of Holman-Moody, a {{position}} he held until December 1971 when he and West Coast driver Eddie Pagan formed Hutcherson-Pagan, a business to build and repair race cars. The two were very successful as they built cars for A. J. Foyt, Darrell Waltrip, Rick Wilson, and others.|$|E

For the latter, <b>another</b> <b>step</b> of evidence is needed, which {{may be related to the}} concept of reversibility, as mentioned below.|$|E

25|$|Another Amoco/Dome {{joint venture}} soon followed. At {{the end of}} the ‘60s, Alberta and Southern Gas Company began {{building}} a larger plant at Cochrane, a small town just west of Calgary. In industry parlance, this was a straddle plant. <b>Another</b> <b>step</b> {{in the development of the}} Amoco/Dome liquids system was Dome’s construction — in 1976 — of the Edmonton Ethane Extraction Plant. This straddle plant replaced an earlier facility.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln {{argued in}} his House Divided Speech that Douglas {{was part of}} a {{conspiracy}} to nationalize slavery. Lincoln said that ending the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in Kansas and Nebraska was the first step in this direction, and that the Dred Scott decision was <b>another</b> <b>step</b> in the direction of spreading slavery into Northern territories. Lincoln expressed the fear that the next Dred Scott decision would make Illinois a slave state.|$|E
25|$|From the enslaved Africans, {{plantation}} owners {{learned how}} to dyke the marshes and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in sweetgrass baskets (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the rice mill increased profitability of the crop, {{and the addition of}} water power for the mills in 1787 by millwright Jonathan Lucas was <b>another</b> <b>step</b> forward.|$|E
50|$|The A-Klasse became just <b>another</b> <b>stepping</b> {{stone for}} the team, winning {{the league and}} earning {{promotion}} to the Bezirksliga Oberbayern-Süd. The team came second in this league {{in its first year}} there too, but failed in the promotion round, losing in extra time to Wacker Burghausen II. After an average 1999-2000 season, it won its league the year after and moved up to the Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern. In this league, the club proved to good as well, winning it and making it into the tier-five Landesliga Bayern-Süd.|$|R

It was with much difficulty that Wyeth and his companions extricated themselves from the clutches of these officious Crows before they were entirely plucked.|$|R
