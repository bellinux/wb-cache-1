25|$|In 1998, {{less than}} six months before his first {{positive}} drug test, Christie won a libel action against the journalist John McVicar. McVicar had insinuated in a satirical magazine that Christie's remarkable rise from 156th in the world to triumph <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> he should have been in decline could only have been achieved through performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
25|$|Her {{writing is}} simple and elegant. She {{published}} her first collection of verses Alo Chhaya in 1889, and two more books after that but then took a break from writing for several years following her marriage and motherhood. She was a feminist <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> merely getting educated was a taboo for a woman. She picked up the cue for feminism from a fellow student of Bethune School, Abala Bose. In an address delivered at a girls' school in Calcutta she declared that the aim of women's education was to contribute to their all-round development and fulfillment of their potential.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to Rome, he was elected {{military}} tribune, {{a first step in}} a political career. He was elected quaestor for 69 BC, and during that year he delivered the funeral oration for his aunt Julia, and included images of her husband Marius in the funeral procession, unseen since the days of Sulla. His wife Cornelia also died that year. Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Spain after her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC. While there, he is said to have encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. On his return in 67 BC, he married Pompeia, a granddaughter of Sulla, whom he later divorced in 61 BC after her embroilment in the Bona Dea scandal.|$|E

500|$|The 1950s saw Hepburn take on {{a series}} of {{professional}} challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> most other actresses began to retreat. Berg describes the decade as [...] "the heart of her vast legacy" [...] and [...] "the period in which she truly came into her own." [...] In January 1950, Hepburn ventured into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind in As You Like It. She hoped to prove that she could play already established material, and said, [...] "It's better to try something difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time." [...] It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows. The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading-lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material onstage.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{found the}} song {{intriguing}} {{and came up}} with interpretations of it as well. Andrew McGregor of the BBC questioned if [...] "Confessions Part II", as well as [...] "Truth Hurts", are only [...] "mere theatre" [...] or telling the truth. Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone focuses on how Usher admits in the song about impregnating a mistress. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Usher was <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> [...] "getting his 'chick on the side'" [...] seemed appropriate. Outside of rumors, Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly said that the best songs from the album were [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Burn", which he described as having smooth melodies. Matt Cibula of Popmatters said of the flow of the concept does not work. He pointed out that in the second part, Usher claims he [...] "barely knows the other lady", while in the first part, he already said that she was his ex-girlfriend. He furthered called it the [...] "wimpiest" [...] song on the theme of the album. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it a [...] "tricky infidelity narrative".|$|E

2500|$|Attentuated FAP {{arises when}} APC is {{defective}} but still somewhat functional. As a result, it retains {{part of its}} ability to suppress polyps. [...] Therefore, attenuated FAP manifests as colorectal cancer unusually late (age 40–70, average=55), and typically with few, or at least far fewer polyps (typically 30), than the more usual version of FAP, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> FAP is no longer considered much of a likelihood or risk according to usual FAP epidemiology.|$|E
2500|$|The second form of FAP, {{known as}} {{attenuated}} {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} has the APC gene functional but slightly impaired. It is therefore somewhat able to operate as usual. [...] Attenuated FAP still presents a high 70% lifetime risk of cancer (as estimated), but typically presents with far fewer polyps (typically 30) rather than the hundreds or thousands usually found in FAP, [...] and arises <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> FAP is usually no longer considered likely—typically between 40 and 70 years old (average 55) rather than the more usual 30's upward. Because it has far fewer polyps, options for management may be different.|$|E
2500|$|Early in his childhood, Head's {{family moved}} from Stoke Newington to Stamford Hill where they {{inhabited}} a house decorated {{for them by}} William Morris. Henry had, by this time, attended two day schools and he now enrolled as a weekly boarder at Friends' School, Grove House, Tottenham. It was here that he met his first mentor, Mr. Ashford, a master at the school. Head described Ashford as [...] "one of the best teachers of natural science I have ever encountered." [...] This was the man, he said, to whom he [...] " [...] the fact that [...] was firmly grounded in the elements of natural science <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> boys at an ordinary school in my day were ignorant of its existence." [...] Perhaps it is to Ashford that we owe the direction Head’s later studies took, though {{it is clear that}} Head had a natural propensity for scientific learning, even at this early age.|$|E

2500|$|Mirza Mohammed Siraj, a {{youth of}} {{seventeen}} years, {{had discovered the}} most vicious propensities, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> only follies are expected from princes. But the great affection which Alivardi Khan had borne to the father was transferred to this son, whom he had for some years bred in his own palace; where instead of correcting the evil dispositions of his nature, he suffered them to increase by overweening indulgence: taught by his minions to regard himself as of a superior order of being, his natural cruelty, hardened by habit, in conception he was not slow, but absurd; obstinate, sullen, and impatient of contradiction; but notwithstanding this insolent contempt of mankind, the confusion of his ideas rendered him suspicious {{of all those who}} approached him, excepting his favourites, who were buffoons and profligate men, raised from menial servants to be his companions: with these he lived in every kind of intemperance and debauchery, and more especially in drinking spiritous liquors to an excess, which inflamed his passions and impaired the little understanding with which he was born. He had, however, cunning enough to carry himself with much demureness in the presence of Allaverdy, whom no one ventured to inform of his real character; for in despotic states the sovereign is always the last to hear what it concerns him most to know." ...|$|E
