He continued with the bombardment and ordered his captains to try small-scale assaults against the walls to gather intelligence.

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but {{towards the end of the}} year Sibelius was confidently asserting that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is as if I had come home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough." ...|$|E
500|$|... “I <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> {{this story}} about a detective who turns into a tree” was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what {{he was working on}} during the early 1980s. Kennedy Martin had become {{frustrated}} that “at the BBC there was no political dimension to their drama whatsoever” but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it would ever get made. The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan as President of the United States had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape and Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the Greenham Common protests, the Falklands War, unrest among the miners and, arising out of the escalation of the Cold War, the fear that “born-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States”.|$|E

500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first act}} was {{completed}} by March 1890; {{the rest of the}} opera was not composed in chronological order, as had been Verdi's usual practice. The musicologist Roger Parker comments that this piecemeal approach may have been [...] "an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes". Progress was slow, with composition [...] "carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods" [...] partly caused by the composer's depression. Verdi was weighed down by the fear of being unable to complete the score, and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends, including the conductors Franco Faccio and Emanuele Muzio. There was no pressure on the composer to hurry. As he observed at the time, he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house, as he had in the past, but was composing for his own pleasure: [...] "in writing Falstaff, I haven't thought about either theatres or singers". He reiterated this idea in December 1890, a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio's death that November: [...] "Will I finish it ? Or will I not finish it? Who knows! I <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> without any aim, without a goal, just to pass a few hours of the day". By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year, but in May he expressed some small optimism, which by mid-June, had turned into: ...|$|E
