40|$|MicroRNAs and siRNAs {{interact}} with target sequences in mRNAs, inducing cleavage- and non-cleavage–based gene repression through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) {{that consists of}} one of four mammalian Argonaute proteins, Ago 1 –Ago 4. The process of how Dicer substrate small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are loaded into different mammalian <b>Agos</b> <b>in</b> vivo is not well established. Here we report that shRNAs are loaded into mammalian <b>Agos</b> <b>in</b> two stepwise processes, physical association and activation, with the latter being the rate-limiting step with noncleaving RISC. We establish that, although RNA duplexes processed from shRNAs bind to <b>Agos</b> <b>in</b> cells with similar affinity, the degree by which the complexes are activated (coupled with {{the removal of the}} passenger strand) correlates with the thermodynamic instability of RNA duplexes being loaded rather than the structure of the RNA, as was previously demonstrated <b>in</b> Drosophila. Interestingly, <b>Ago</b> loading of siRNAs is less sensitive to thermostability than that of their shRNA equivalents. These results may have important implications for the future design of RNAi-based therapeutics...|$|R

40|$|ARGONAUTE {{proteins}} (AGOs) {{are generally}} accepted as {{key components of}} the post transcriptional gene silencing mechanism, also involved in plant antiviral defense. Except for reports on the antiviral roles of AGO 1, AGO 2 and <b>AGO</b> 7 <b>in</b> Arabidopsis, the exact roles played by the individual <b>AGOs</b> <b>in</b> other plant species are largely unknown. This research focused on the identification and characterization of <b>AGOs</b> involved <b>in</b> antiviral RNAi response to various viruses in N. benthamiana. Based on the temporal and spatial distribution of <b>AGO</b> transcripts <b>in</b> 3 and 8 -week old plant root, stem and leaf tissues, expressions of NbAGO mRNAs were found to vary with age and tissue specificity. Plant endogenous AGO mRNAs were knocked down through virus induced gene silencing techniques using the Tobacco rattle virus vector system and posteriorly challenged with a GFP-chimeric virus construct deficient of a silencing suppressor. Unlike in control non-silenced plants, the Tomato bushy stunt virus construct deficient of its P 19 silencing suppressor was consistently seen to exhibit a strong fluorescence on N. benthamiana plants silenced for NbAGOs 2 and X. Similar results were also obtained upon silencing of NbAGO 2 using hairpin vector techniques. Comparable observations were also made when Tobacco mosaic virus GFP constructs were agroinfiltrated on NbAGO 2 silenced plants further hinting the antiviral defense roles played by these AGOs. Agroinfiltration of Foxtailmosaic virus, Sunnhemp mosaic virus, and Turnip crinkle virus GFP chimeric constructs on NbAGO 2 silenced N. benthamiana plants, however {{did not result in}} accumulation of GFP indicating the AGO antiviral defense specificity to TBSV and TMV. The results also hinted at a role for AGO 7. Collectively my findings suggest that the expression of <b>AGOs</b> <b>in</b> N. benthamiana is tissue and age dependent, and that unlike in the model plant Arabidopsis where the main antiviral AGO is thought to be AtAGO 1; in N. benthamiana, NbAGOs 2 and X seem to be involved in an antiviral defense role against TBSV and TMV with other AGOs perhaps contributing...|$|R

40|$|RNA-directed DNA {{methylation}} (RdDM) {{is a small}} interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated epigenetic modification {{that contributes}} to transposon silencing in plants. RdDM requires a complex transcriptional machinery that includes specialized RNA polymerases, named Pol IV and Pol V, as well as chromatin remodelling proteins, transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and other plant-specific proteins whose functions are not yet clarified. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DICER-LIKE 3 {{and members of the}} ARGONAUTE 4 group of ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins are involved, respectively, in generating and using 24 -nt siRNAs that trigger methylation and transcriptional gene silencing of homologous promoter sequences.

5|$|The {{first known}} {{members of the}} genus Mammuthus are the African species M. subplanifrons from the Pliocene, and M. africanavus from the Pleistocene.

The earliest European mammoth has been named M. rumanus; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8–10 enamel ridges. A population evolved 12–14 ridges, splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming M. meridionalis about 2–1.7 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>In</b> turn, this species was replaced by the steppe mammoth (M. trogontherii) with 18–20 ridges, which evolved in eastern Asia around 1 million years ago. The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of M. trogontherii that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar ridges. Mammoths derived from M. trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges 400,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> Siberia and became the woolly mammoth.
