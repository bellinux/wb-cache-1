5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games {{are known to be}} exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcendent.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{successes in}} America, the Australian Swimming Union {{did not offer}} to fund a return home for Brooks for the 1982 Australian Championships, but the University of Arkansas paid his fare {{as a reward for}} his {{performances}} in collegiate competition. Despite failing to defend his 100m title, he qualified for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The team then went into a five-week training camp in the seaside Sydney suburb of South Coogee. The team resided at a migrant hostel, which at the time was primarily occupied by Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War. Brooks spoke out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accommodation, leading officials to make improvements.|$|E

5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon on a table in Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell {{into the hands of the}} insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|There were {{complaints}} that year from officials {{at all three}} of the mints concerning the quality of the coins produced. In the summer of 1874, coiner A. Loudon Snowden issued a formal complaint to Pollock <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strikings, most notably on the high points of the design; Barber began modifying the design later that year, reducing the relief. The modified dies began service in 1875. In the fall of that year, Linderman suggested that the reverse of the trade dollar should be altered in 1876 to commemorate the centennial of American independence; Pollock opposed the idea, noting that such a change would be difficult to carry out because Congressional approval would be necessary and that it might cause the coin to lose favor in the Orient. In May 1876, former assistant engraver Anthony C. Paquet created a reverse die after being hired by Linderman to improve the striking quality of the coins. Linderman approved of the new design, but it was ultimately rejected by Mint officials due to fears of Chinese disapproval.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s the West Indian team {{had begun to}} decline. It was {{defeated}} by Australia in a 1994–95 series, the Third Test of which was played at the Queen's Park Oval, as {{were two of the}} ODI matches. The ground hosted two Tests of the 1997–98 tour by England, the second of which in February saw the West Indies defeated by England. The West Indian captain during the match, Brian Lara, went on to be the leading run scorer at the Queen's Park Oval in ODI matches, as well as hold record for the highest score made there. The West Indies lost heavily again to Australia at the ground in 1999, by a margin of 312 runs. This, the opening Test of the series, set the tone for a five-nil whitewash of the host team by the visiting Australians. The retirement of Ambrose and Courtney Walsh in 2001 further hampered West Indian efforts, and they were defeated at the Queen's Park Oval by South Africa in March, and India in August 2001. They were likewise defeated in ODI matches at the ground by both sides. The West Indies dropped to eighth in the Test rankings, with another heavy loss at the Queen's Park Oval against England in 2004, amid complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch from England players. The West Indies also suffered at the hands of South Africa during ODI matches played at the ground.|$|E

25|$|Quantum {{efficiency}} is most usefully {{expressed as a}} spectral measurement (that is, {{as a function of}} photon wavelength or energy).

25|$|However, it is {{very likely}} that a new stadium would have been needed in any event, as the Met was not well maintained. By the park's final season, {{railings}} in the grandstand's third deck had become a major safety hazard. Additionally, players had begun to complain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field; the infield in particular was considered the worst in the majors. Rumors abounded that the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which by then had taken over the stadium from the city of Minneapolis, had deliberately let the Met go to seed in order to aid the push for the Metrodome.|$|E
25|$|The {{casualties}} were about equal {{on both sides}} – around 1,317 Union and 1,230 Confederate/Missourian/Arkansan soldiers were either killed, wounded, or captured. Though the Confederate force won the field, {{they were unable to}} pursue the retreating Union forces to Rolla. Price wanted to start a pursuit of the Union force immediately, but McCulloch refused, worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri State Guard and the length of his supply line back to Arkansas. With the victory, Price's Missouri Guard began an invasion of northern Missouri that culminated in the First Battle of Lexington on September 20, 1861. The Confederate and Arkansas forces withdrew from the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{order in}} which the episodes were {{broadcast}} was rather different. Death Squad by Pip and Jane Baker – in which Blake, Gan and Jenna would infiltrate a Federation facility attempting to create 'super-soldiers' by administering drugs to humans, leading to Blake and Gan becoming exposed to the drugs and Jenna being held by Servalan as an inducement for the scientist behind the plan – was abandoned. This was ostensibly on cost grounds, although Boucher had concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script. The episodes were re-ordered; Horizon, Allan Prior's 'Ugandan' script replaced Death Squad, while Holmes' script, Killer, became the seventh episode. Pressure Point, Terry Nation's Storm Mountain script, became the fifth and Trial, the Travis court-martial story, was moved to sixth.|$|E

It is said that shortly after he became rector, Elisha Brooks Joyce received complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music, so that he appointed George Wilmot, the parish’s first professional chorister. A decade later Wilmot was appointed the first music director and in 1893 he established a formally vested men’s and boys’ choir, which first performed for the Easter Service in 1894. The present Christ Church music program inherits the legacy established by Wilmot.|$|E
25|$|Hilldale {{started the}} season with a 9–2 record, jumping to an early lead. By June 13, Harrisburg had taken a narrow lead and was {{scheduled}} to face Hilldale in a two-game series. Hilldale won the first game 11 to 9, retaking the lead, and the next day second game was called due to rain after Harrisburg had taken a 6–2 lead, prompting an outraged letter to the editor from Oscar Charleston, Harrisburg's manager and star center fielder. Charleston complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> umpiring in the first game and the decision to call the second game. Charleston's outburst prompted a strong rebuttal from Ed Bolden, owner of the Hilldale Club and chairman of the ECL commission. Shortly after the game, Harrisburg retook the lead and held it for nearly a month. On July 19, Hilldale regained the lead when Baltimore swept a doubleheader from Harrisburg.|$|E
25|$|The {{high profile}} {{and demand for}} a {{high-quality}} local translation means that {{a great deal of}} care is often taken in the task. In some countries, such as Italy, the first book was revised by the publishers and issued in an updated edition in response to readers who complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first translation. In countries such as China and Portugal, the translation is conducted by a group of translators working together to save time. Some of the translators hired to work on the books were quite well known before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. Golyshev was previously best known for having translated William Faulkner and George Orwell, and was known to snub the Harry Potter books in interviews and refer to them as inferior literature. The Turkish translation of books two to five was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.|$|E
