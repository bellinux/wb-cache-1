40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{is a critical}} driver of many processes on the earth’s surface. In fields such as micrometeorology, environmental science and climatology the estimation of the thermic action of the relief and the calculation of the radiative budget of the surfaces constitute an important prerequisite for any modelling work. Unlike rainfall it is difficult or almost impossible to measure solar radiation at <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>sights</b> and interpolate this to estimate the values at other locations due to the high dependence of solar radiation on topography. GIS-based solar radiation models allow us to take into account, on a fine scale, {{the complexity of the}} interactions between the incident solar radiation (direct as well as diffuse) and the local topography. Such models provide a rapid, cost-efficient and accurate estimation of radiation over large areas, while considering slope and aspect gradients, and shadowing effects. While GIS-based models predict the potential direct (and in some cases diffuse) radiation and are able to predict quite accurately the relative spatial variation, for a number of applications the actual and not the potential solar {{radiation is}} needed. This is especially so for micrometeorological and evapotranspiration related studies. This paper discusses the correlation between the GIS modelled radiation and the actual recorded data and presents regression equations {{that can be used to}} convert modelled radiation for use in other environmental models that utilize field recorded solar radiation data. The impacts of different climatic conditions as well as seasons on the regression equations are discussed. Analysis of daily meteorological records spanning eight years for a number of stations around Australia show that the correlations are quite high (r 2 = 0. 95) when the data is pooled and higher still (r 2 = 0. 98) when seasonal effects are taken into consideration. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{birthplace of}} the Christmas tree is the {{territory}} of the Aleman people, thus the territories of Baden and Alsace along {{the upper part of the}} river Rhine. Its direct predecessors are the maypole trees during winter and Christmas time, thus the branches of pine trees with which the houses, economical and agricultural buildings, fences and wells along the upper Rhine were decorated inside and out during the midwinter festivities (Christmas, New Year etc). According to a medieval legal principle in upper Alsace, the peasants had the right to bring a cartful of wood (branches of pine trees in the first place) on Christmas Eve from the forest. Written legal principles and customs recording this habit can be found in many cities of upper Alsace: Sundhofen (around 1300), Bergheim (1369), Germar (14 th century). The habit of decorating houses with evergreen branches at Christmas is in Strasbourg and Freiburg 500 years old. The cities of the Alsace region have guarded their forests in the days before the midwinter festivities against thieves. We know of a bill of a sum paid to the foresters guarding the forests at St. Thomas’s day (21 st December) in Schlettstadt (1521). The judge of Sankt Pilt did put the forest of the city under heavy guard for nine days before and after Christmas, because of a legal principle of the upper Alsace (14 th century). The cities and landowners tried to keep the number and size of the may-pole trees meant to be cut for Christmas via decrees at bay. Türkheim has in 1611 decreed that anyone who cuts out more than one tree for Christmas has to pay a fine. In a legal principle at Adolsheim (1431) the landowner has allowed the cutting of a 7 feet tall pine tree. The great size of the may-pole trees shows that they are no more branches to decorate a room or small trees hanging from the ceiling, but big Christmas trees standing in the house or in the open. In Strasbourg the sale of Christmas tree began in 1539. According to their accounts, the wealthy house of Sichenheim did pay for pine trees and branches. The cathedral of Strasbourg did have a standing Christmas tree in the same year. The manuscript <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>sights</b> from Strasbourg (1604 or 1605) describes many decorated Christmas trees in guild houses of artisans. The Christmas tree was also popular in Freiburg (14 th century) : The town council was forced to fine those who cut may-pole trees for Christmas illegally. In the town hospital to the Holy Spirit the bakers decorated a large Christmas tree, which remained untouched until New Year. Its edible decorations, cakes, fruits were distributed among the poor at the Christmas-tree festivities in the 17 th– 18 th centuries. The accounts of the hospital show that between 1625 and 1773 they had always expenses for the decoration of the Christmas tree. The historical clues show us that the Christmas tree was a popular habit on both sides of the upper Rhine in the 16 th century among the Protestants and the Catholic Christians as well...|$|E

40|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of cosmic-rays [...] - {{a product of}} particle acceleration and subsequent diffusion [...] - is generally assumed to be uniform throughout the Galaxy (Webber 1998). As a result, the cosmic-ray ionization rate inferred in similar environments (e. g. in several diffuse clouds) should also be relatively constant. However, current estimates of the ionization rate in diffuse molecular clouds vary over the range (1 - 8) × 10 - 16 s- 1. In addition, there are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>sight</b> lines with 3 σ upper limits of ζ 2 ≤ 10 - 16 s- 1, suggesting even lower ionization rates in some clouds. This roughly order of magnitude difference in the cosmic-ray ionization rate between sight lines contradicts {{the concept of a}} spatially uniform cosmic-ray flux. We present cosmic-ray ionization rates derived from several published and unpublished spectroscopic observations of H 3 + in diffuse cloud sight lines. These ionization rates are then compared with various other parameters (Galactic latitude, Galactic longitude, hydrogen column density) in a search for correlations. Also, sight lines in close proximity are compared to each other to determine the variability of the ionization rate on small spatial scales.

Lastly, during the fall occurrence report for 1988 (NBR 57 : 16, 53) Kittiwakes were reported from Cedar and Douglas-northern Sarpy counties, the Cedar County sightings involving up to three first-winter birds and being accompanied by photographs. In May of 1990, an adult Kittiwake was washed ashore along Lake Ogallala, Keith County, and found by Dr. Daniel Brooks, a parasitologist of the University of Toronto.

40|$|Tuna-dolphin-bird feeding assemblages {{are unique}} to the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). These {{multiple}} species groups are believed to forage together {{in response to the}} physical properties of the near surface ocean as these constrain the distribution of prey. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), intra-annual and interannual changes affect the properties of the water column, inducing mesoscale and fine scale temporal variability. Four three-week oceanographic surveys took place, in September 2008, April 2009, October 2009, and September 2010, between the coast of Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands and one small boat survey took place in June 2010 within the GMR. Marine mammal surveys were conducted during daylight hours and Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) sensor casts were taken throughout the survey. Data were analyzed to determine the types of water masses present and the strength and depth of the thermocline layer. These data were compared with the sightings of marine mammals, bird feeding groups, and tuna-dolphin-bird assemblages. Additionally, these data were used to predict where tuna would be likely to associate with dolphin groups. Results show Equatorial Surface Water was the dominant water mass throughout the archipelago, regardless of season or ENSO index. High salinity, cold water west of Isla Isabela indicated topographic upwelling of the Equatorial Undercurrent. Tropical Surface Waters from the Panama Current were detected north of the Equatorial Front to the east of the islands. Obvious changes in the water column properties were observed between El Ni?o and La Ni?a events in the GMR. Most mixed groups were sighted west and south of Isla Isabela during the four oceanographic surveys, as well as north and west of Isla San Cristobal in June 2010. Most sightings were in cool, high salinity waters, and high chlorophyll concentrations. There were a greater number of sightings during the April 2009 survey (ENSO-neutral conditions) than during any of the three fall surveys. Additionally, tuna-dolphin-bird groups {{were more likely to be}} seen near Isla Isabela, with the majority of them sighted during the April 2009 survey and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>sighted</b> in each of the September 2008 and October 2009 surveys.
