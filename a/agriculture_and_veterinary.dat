The experiment design used was the randomized complete block design and each of the experimental treatment was replicated three times. A Wheat cultivar, Digalu was grown with (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80) Wild Oat densities as a treatment. Data were recorded on wheat plant height, number of tillers, fresh weight and dry weight. The result revealed that various Wild Oats densities statistically (p≤ 0. 05) affected plant height, number of tillers, fresh weight and dry weight. The maximum values of all the parameters were recorded in the (0) Wild Oat density as well as from Wild Oats density (20). Whereas, the minimum values of these parameters were recorded where (80) wild oats densities were present. From the study it could be concluded that Wheat yield and yield components were greatly affected by Wild Oat densities. Judicious control measures for wild oats are recommended to be adopted that can control Wild Oats in Wheat crop to reduce the crop losses due to this noxious weed...|$|R
