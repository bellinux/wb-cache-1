Shivaji had {{great respect for}} other contemporary saints, especially Samarth Ramdas, to whom he gave the fort of Parali, later renamed as 'Sajjangad'. Among the various poems written on Shivaji, Ramdas' Shivastuti ("Praise of King Shivaji") is the most famous. Shivaji's son Sambhaji later built a samadhi for Ramdas Swami on Sajjangad upon the latter's death. Samarth Ramdas had also written a letter to Sambhaji guiding him {{on what to do}} <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>not</b> to do after death of Shivaji.|$|E

It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.|$|E

In Bloomberg News, the critics commented that the playwrights were [...] "literary alchemists expert at mixing the sentimental and the satirical and turning out something poignant" [...] and noted that the clothing and accessories dominated the memories while [...] "The men are extras."

Helen Shaw, writing for Time Out, also described the Ephrons' style as similar to The Vagina Monologuess' Eve Ensler. [...] Jay Reiner of The Hollywood Reporter also notes that from the work [...] "a tapestry of the collective female psyche emerges that is tender and insightful without being sentimental". TheaterMania.com, Inc. describes the show as [...] "So insightful and entertaining is this survey of sartorial preoccupations and the deeper questions underlying them that multiple viewings would be advisable." ...|$|E

This is the proof: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them' (Matt. 18:20). How much more is he present where the whole congregation is assembled to his honor! But that his body is literally eaten is far from the truth and the nature of faith. It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught).

2500|$|Though {{there is}} no strict rule on what to consume <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>not</b> to, paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal {{influenced}} by Jains. Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only [...] "pure" [...] (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that a sentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development. Other reasons maybe lack of availability of meat and forced diet by rulers.|$|E
