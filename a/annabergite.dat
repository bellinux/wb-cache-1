5000|$|The use of azurite and {{malachite}} as copper ore indicators led indirectly to {{the name}} of the element nickel in the English language. Nickeline, a principal ore of nickel that is also known as niccolite, weathers at the surface into a green mineral (<b>annabergite)</b> that resembles malachite. This resemblance resulted in occasional attempts to smelt nickeline in the belief that it was copper ore, but such attempts always ended in failure due to high smelting temperatures needed to reduce nickel. In Germany this deceptive mineral {{came to be known as}} kupfernickel, literally [...] "copper demon". The Swedish alchemist Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (who had been trained by Georg Brandt, the discoverer of the nickel-like metal cobalt) realized that there was probably a new metal hiding within the kupfernickel ore, and in 1751 he succeeded in smelting kupfernickel to produce a previously unknown (except in certain meteorites) silvery white, iron-like metal. Logically, Cronstedt named his new metal after the nickel part of kupfernickel.|$|E

Trends in Raman band positions of the antisymmetric arsenate stretching vibrations are sensitive to the site occupancy of metal ions in the crystal structure. Changes in the crystal morphology, unit-cell parameters and vibrational spectra have been rationalized in terms of the site occupancy of Co and Ni in the crystal structure. Substitution of Ni is directed to metal site 1 (C 2 h site symmetry) whereas Co is directed to metal site 2 (C 2 site symmetry).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{vibrational}} spectroscopy of the aragonite and vivianite arsenate minerals (erythrite, <b>annabergite</b> and hörnesite), specifically the assignment of the spectra. The infrared and Raman spectra of cerussite have been assigned according to the vibrational symmetry species. The assignment of satellite bands to 18 O isotopes has been discussed {{with respect to the}} use of these bands to the quantification of the isotopes. Overtone and combination bands have been assigned according to symmetry species and their corresponding fundamental vibrations. The vibrational spectra of cerussite have been compared with other aragonite group minerals and the differences explained on the basis of differing chemistry and crystal structures of these minerals. The single crystal spectra of natural erythrite has been reported and compared with the synthetic equivalent. The symmetry species of the vibrations have been assigned according to single crystal and factor group considerations. Deuteration experiments have allowed the assignment of water vibrational freque ncies to discrete water molecules in the crystal structure. Differences in the spectra of other vivianite arsenates, namely <b>annabergite</b> and hörnesite, have been explained by consideration of their differing chemistry and crystal structures. A novel approach to the assignment of site occupancy of ions in the erythrite - <b>annabergite</b> solid solution has been reported. This approach has utilised vibrational spectroscopy, in conjunction with careful consideration of the crystal structures of the minerals. It has been shown that in the erythrite - <b>annabergite</b> solid solution Coprefers metal site 2 contrasting nickel which prefers site 1. This study in conjunction with other studies has yielded the trend that the more electronegative metal prefers to occupy site 1, with the least electronegative metal preferring to occupy site 2. Fundamentally this thesis has increased the knowledge base of the spectroscopic properties of the aragonite and the vivianite minerals. The site occupancy of metal ion substitutions in solid solution series of the vivianite group of minerals has been further enhanced, with novel method of studying the site occupancy of ions in solid solutions has been developed.

40|$|Abstract: The local {{environment}} of the arsenate ion in the solid solution between <b>annabergite</b> and erythrite has been deduced {{in terms of the}} surrounding metal ions. The change in the metal ion {{environment of}} the arsenate produces a change in the factor group splitting of the arsenate molecule in the Raman spectra. This then allows the metal ion site occupancy to be deduced. Vivianite group of minerals have the general formula A 32 +(XO 4) 2. 8 H 2 O, where A 2 + may be Co, Fe, Mg, Ni, or Zn and X may be P or As [1]. Vivianite minerals are monoclinic with space group 2 /m and two formula units per unit cell. Single crystal X-ray diffraction {{studies have shown that the}} unit cell contains two sites (of C 2 h andC 2 symmetry) occupied by two independent metal atoms, as well as one independent arsenate ion (of Cs site symmetry) and two independent water molecules (C 1 site symmetry). Site occupancy of the metal ion in vivianites is, at present, not well understood due to the absence of high quality (ie. synchrotron) X-ray crystal data and because well defined vivianite solid solutions are difficult to find in nature. As part of a wider study of vivianites, minerals of the Co+ 2 (erythrite) to Ni+ 2 (<b>annabergite)</b> solid solution series have been synthesised and characterised using IR and Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with SEM-EDX and XRD.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} lead-zinc-copper veins {{are developed}} within a NE-SW trending fracture system in rocks of the Eycott Volcanic Group at Driggith and Sandbed mines in the Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria. The lead veins were worked by {{a succession of}} mining companies from the 18 th century onward, first at Driggith mine and later at Sandbed mine. East-west trending baryte-quartz-carbonate veins were worked for baryte in the mid- 20 th century. The dumps from these mines surround {{and in some cases}} cover those of the earlier lead workings. Several episodes of primary mineralisation can be distinguished. The primary lead vein mineralisation comprises major quartz, calcite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite. Sparse antimony-rich sulphide mineralisation is present as inclusions in the galena. There is rich, localised, iron sulphide-arsenopyrite mineralisation, which pre-dates the lead-copper-zinc vein mineralisation; sparse nickel- and cobalt-bearing mineralisation of unknown affinity, and baryte mineralisation with quartz and carbonates that post-dates the lead-copper-zinc vein mineralisation. The later baryte is present in distinct E-W trending veins and as a later stage of mineralisation in the fractures that host the lead-copper-zinc vein mineralisation. Supergene oxidation is extensive. About sixty supergene minerals have been identified. Distinctive specimens of curved green arsenate-rich pyromorphite on hackly quartz are well known from the opencut above Driggith mine. Bayldonite, cerussite, mimetite and malachite are widespread and abundant. Anglesite, aurichalcite, hemimorphite, Iinarite and philipsburgite are relatively common in micro-crystalline specimens. The arsenate minerals bariumpharmacosiderite, beudantite, mimetite, segnitite and scorodite form distinct localised gossans, which are closely associated with primary arsenopyrite. A variety of sulphate minerals including brochantite, langite, linarite, serpierite and schulenbergite have been formed by post-mining oxidation.

40|$|The {{production}} and storage of uranium mine mill tailings {{have the potential}} to contaminate local groundwater and surface waters with metals and metalloids. As such, an understanding of the solids reservoirs for potential contaminants in uranium ore blends and leach residues (solid wastes generated by the milling of ore) is required to predict long-term controls on these contaminants in tailings porewaters. This study characterized the distribution of the elements of concern (EOCs; As, Mo, Ni, and Se) in uranium ores and waste rock used to blend the mill feeds in the milling process and leach residues from the Key Lake mining operation, Saskatchewan. This study also evaluated the alteration of the clay minerals in these uranium ores, waste rocks and leach residues. X-ray diffraction, electron micro-probe, and mineral liberation analyses showed that the reservoirs for As, Mo, Ni, and Se (in ores and ore blends) were dominated by sulphides including cobaltite, gersdorffite, molybdenite, pyrite, galena and chalcopyrite, secondary Ni-arsenates (<b>annabergite?),</b> Fe-arsenate (scorodite?) and Ni-Co/Ni-sulfates. The secondary arsenates and sulfates present in special waste were identified as major As, Mo, Ni, and Se bearing minerals and most likely the product of oxidation of arsenide-bearing sulphide minerals within the special waste rock. Analyses also showed that sulphides and arsenates occurred in trace amounts in the ores and special waste rock (0. 5 to 1. 0 wt %). Data showed that 55 to 90 % pyrite, 36 to 51 % chalcopyrite, 23 to 37 % molybdenite, and 52 to 70 % galena remained unleached in the leach residues after milling of the ore blends. The percentages of unleached minerals varied between mill feeds and were dependent on the grain-size distribution and the degree of mineral liberation. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) analysis indicated an increase of the CEC values in the leach residues suggesting possible evolution of 2 : 1 layers into high-charge layers during the milling...|$|E

The natural Skutterudite is a cobalt arsenide mineral that contains variable amounts of Ni and Fe, substituting for cobalt, having the general formula: (Co,Ni,Fe) As 3. Its orogeny is hydrothermal, in moderate-high temperature; it is often found associated with other minerals such as Arsenopyrite, native Silver, Erythrite, <b>Annabergite,</b> Nickeline, Cobaltite, Silver sulfosalts, native Bismuth, Calcite, Siderite, Barite and Quartz. Its density is about 6. 5 g/cm 3 and the Mohs hardness is 6 but these values strictly depend on the composition. Synthetic skutterudites are now produced in laboratory. They include compounds having the composition MX 3, where M is a transition metal of the VIII, IX, X group and X represents a pnitogen atom belonging to the XV group. Oftedal in 1928 identified CoAs 3 as the first synthetic skutterudites and determined its structure as a cubic body-centered cell and space group. CoAs 3 is now reported as the prototype compound for skutterudites. The modelling of skutterudite properties has been the subject of a large number of publications over the past decades. In this review we will only consider a limited set of results pertaining to Fe- or Ni-based skutterudites. This choice aims at preserving coherence with the experimental section of this chapter that mainly deals with these types of compounds...|$|E
