500|$|Pronouns {{are used}} to refer to {{entities}} deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation — for example the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence I <b>already</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. [...] "he sent it to himself" [...] or [...] "she braced herself for impact").|$|E

6000|$|... "And what am I now?" [...] demanded he, {{looking into}} her face, and {{permitting}} the whole evil within {{him to be}} written on his features. [...] "I have <b>already</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> what I am--a fiend! Who made me so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou canst not think," [...] {{said the}} minister, glancing aside at Hester Prynne, [...] "how my heart dreads this interview, and yearns for it! But, in truth, as I <b>already</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee,</b> {{children}} are not readily won {{to be familiar with}} me. They will not climb my knee, nor prattle in my ear, nor answer to my smile, but stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even little babes, when I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet Pearl, twice in her little lifetime, hath been kind to me! The first time--thou knowest it well! The last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of yonder stern old Governor." ...|$|R

In 1999, Aguilera performed [...] "Genie in a Bottle" [...] at the 1999 Teen Choice Awards. Aguilera also attended the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, where she and Fred Durst performed together. Aguilera performed [...] "Come on Over Baby", wearing a tight ruby red outfit with black and red streaks in her hair, and near the end, Durst walked onstage and performed part of his band's song [...] "Livin' It Up" [...] with Aguilera. After eliciting charged reactions from his fans, Durst stated: [...] "I <b>already</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man." [...] The feud died weeks later, when Aguilera denied Durst's statement, saying Durst [...] "got no nookie." [...] Later on, in 2000, Aguilera performed at the Super Bowl XXXIV as a halftime performer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Once <b>already</b> have I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> and I {{venture to}} think that mine is a name not easily forgotten. I am the Sieur Marcel de Saint-Pol, Marquis of Bardelys, of Bardelys in Picardy." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood back}} and laughed. [...] "If there are any more of his brothel-mates in the house, they can escape as he did. They will be more {{fortunate}} than that one." [...] And he pointed up to the limp figure hanging from the balcony, so that I now learnt what <b>already</b> I have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think they}} have seen {{something}} to frighten them. I believe that the soldiers are behind us. They have given the order to fill the waterskins, and be ready for a start when the darkness comes. But I am ordered to gather you together, for the Moolah is coming to convert you all. I have <b>already</b> <b>told</b> him that <b>you</b> are all very much inclined to think the same with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{have any}} claim! What {{do you mean}} by that, sir? And I shall send nothing in to Mr. Round. I have had quite enough of Mr. Round <b>already.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> from the beginning, Mr. Mason, that I would {{have nothing to do with}} this affair as {{connected}} with Mr. Round. I have devoted myself entirely to this matter since you were pleased to engage my services at Groby Park. It is not by my fault that you have failed. I think, Mr. Mason, you will do me the justice to acknowledge that." [...] And then Dockwrath was silent for a moment, as though waiting for an answer.|$|R

6000|$|... "Please {{not to call}} it by any name," [...] said Dorothea, {{putting out}} her hands entreatingly. [...] "You will say it is Persian, or {{something}} else geographical. It is my life. I have found it out, and cannot part with it. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little girl. I used to pray so much--now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have desires merely for myself, because {{they may not be}} good for others, and I have too much <b>already.</b> I only <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> that you might know quite well how my days go at Lowick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{had seen}} {{more of the}} world, Lucilla," [...] he said, [...] "you would know that a true love like yours is a mystery to a woman like Madame Pratolungo. She doesn't believe in it--she doesn't {{understand}} it. She knows herself {{to be capable of}} breaking any engagement, if the circumstances encouraged her--and she estimates your fidelity by her knowledge of her own nature. There is nothing in her experience of you, or in her knowledge of my brother's disfigurement, to discourage such a woman from scheming to part us. She has seen for herself--what <b>you</b> have <b>already</b> <b>told</b> me--that <b>you</b> have got over your first aversion to him. She knows that women as charming as you are, have over and over again married men far more personally repulsive than my brother. Lucilla! something which is not to be out-argued, and not to be contradicted, tells me that her return to England will be fatal to my hopes, if that return finds you and me with no closer tie between us than the tie that binds us now. Are these fanciful apprehensions, unworthy of a man? My darling! worthy or not worthy, you ought to make allowances for them. They are apprehensions inspired by my love for You!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] replies the critic; [...] "I want {{no other}} light and shade. I have <b>already</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that it is}} my {{business}} to see things just as they are." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{my uncle}} had {{finished}} his story, I, as I have <b>already</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> rose {{up and said}} that I would sleep in the Blue Chamber that very night.|$|E
6000|$|... "What I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> when I {{first came}} in this evening was quite true," [...] said her husband, slowly.

6000|$|... "Daggett has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> this, Deacon Pratt"--said Gardiner, in his off-hand way. [...] "And {{he is the}} man who has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{of those}} sealing-islands too?" ...|$|R
