5|$|Prince Sadruddin had a {{taste for}} culture, {{including}} music, art and literature. He was <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His {{concern for the environment}} was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen skier and an accomplished sailor. While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the Paris Review, which was established with the aim of bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the Review awards the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction (established by his father) for the best short story that it published in the past year.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Earl of Shaftesbury became <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> {{in some of}} the nightspots on the French Riviera. He {{was known}} for his black leather trousers, pink shirts, and large red and black eyeglasses. He had a habit of {{flashing}} his money around as he bought drinks {{for a wide variety of}} female companions. At one such establishment on the Riviera, he met Jamila Ben M'Barek (born c. 1961), a divorcée and the mother of two children from a previous relationship. She was one of seven children born in Paris to a Tunisian mother and Moroccan father. In 1993, M'Barek had posed naked in Playboy, but it did not cause alarm. They were married on 5 November 2002, at Hilversum in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Burke and Hare's next {{victim was}} <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> {{in the streets}} of Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by {{deformed}} feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.|$|E

25|$|The war then {{interrupted}} his career, with Washbrook {{becoming a}} physical training instructor in the Royal Air Force, {{and it was}} in the 1946-47 Ashes series that he finally took on Australia. Hutton and Washbrook made three consecutive century stands, as Washbrook, with his cricket cap cocked in a jaunty style, became <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> to cricket fans in Australia and England.|$|E
25|$|For {{the best}} part of two centuries, the {{independent}} Rajput Sultanate of Gujarat was the cynosure of its neighbors on account of its wealth and prosperity, which had long made the Gujarati merchant <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> in the ports of the Indian Ocean. Gujaratis, including Hindus and Muslims as well as the enterprising Parsi class of Zoroastrians, had been specializing in the organisation of overseas trade for many centuries, and had moved into various branches of commerce such as commodity trade, brokerage, money-changing, money-lending and banking.|$|E
5000|$|Composer Paul Curtis, <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> contest <b>figure</b> between 1975 and 1986, {{returned}} to the national final with [...] "Give a Little Love Back to the World". The performer of this anthemic number was 15-year-old Emma from Bridgend.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> mysterious <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> {{has been}} {{stalking}} Tim Drake wearing Stephanie's Spoiler costume, which {{at one point}} Tim thinks he imagined it to be Stephanie herself.

60|$|The Lapland was {{two days}} out from Tilbury before Pamela {{appeared}} on deck, followed by her maid with {{an armful of}} cushions, and the deck steward with her rugs.

25|$|The future journalist, born in Russian-held Bessarabia (the Bessarabia Governorate), was {{a member}} of the ethnic Romanian {{cultural}} elite, and, reportedly, a graduate of the Bessarabian Orthodox Church Chișinău Theological Seminary. According to other sources, he spent his early years in Kiev and graduated from the Pavlo Galagan College. Nour furthered his studies in other regions of the Russian Empire, where he became <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> to those who opposed Tsarist autocracy, and exchanged ideas with radical young men of various ethnic backgrounds. He is known to have studied Philology at Kiev University, where he affiliated with the underground Socialist-Revolutionary (Eser) Party, probably infiltrated in its ranks by the Okhrana.|$|E
500|$|The male {{equivalent}} of the mermaid is the merman, also <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> in folklore and heraldry.

500|$|Biden was <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> to his Delaware constituency, {{by virtue}} of his daily train {{commuting}} from there, [...] and generally sought to attend to state needs. [...] Biden was a strong supporter of increased Amtrak funding and rail security; he hosted barbecues and an annual Christmas dinner for the Amtrak crews, and they would sometimes hold the last train of the night a few minutes so he could catch it. [...] He earned the nickname [...] "Amtrak Joe" [...] as a result (and in 2011, Amtrak's Wilmington Station was named the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station, in honor of the over 7,000 trips he made from there). He was an advocate for Delaware military installations, including Dover Air Force Base and New Castle Air National Guard Base.|$|E
60|$|Twilight {{was falling}} as Martin left the fruit store and turned homeward, his {{marketing}} on his arm. At the corner an electric car had stopped, and at sight of <b>a</b> lean, <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> alighting, his heart leapt with joy. It was Brissenden, {{and in the}} fleeting glimpse, ere the car started up, Martin noted the overcoat pockets, one bulging with books, the other bulging with a quart bottle of whiskey.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{described}} by Sir Winston Churchill as [...] "Scotland's greatest ever ambassador". He became <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> worldwide <b>figure</b> promoting images like the kilt and the cromach (walking stick) to huge acclaim, especially in America. Other songs followed, including [...] "Roamin' in the Gloamin", [...] "A Wee Deoch-an-Doris", [...] "The End of the Road" [...] and, a particularly big hit for him, [...] "I Love a Lassie".|$|R
60|$|Granet {{made his}} way along the empty corridor, rang for the lift and descended into the hall. A smile was upon his lips. The torch at last was kindled! In the hall of the hotel he came across a group of {{assembling}} guests just starting for the luncheon room. <b>A</b> tall, <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> stepped for <b>a</b> moment on one side. His heart gave a little jump. Geraldine held out her pearl-gloved hand.|$|R
500|$|Fender {{initially}} {{wanted to}} be a barrister, but his family could not afford the costs. By 1914, he was working for the [...] firm of paper manufacturers and stationers [...] of which his father was managing director. Although he permitted Fender to play cricket, his father believed that sport and a business career were incompatible. Fender disagreed, suggesting that the contacts made in county cricket offset the lost working time. To aid his business career, Fender moved to London during the winter of 1913–14. Fender was qualified by his birthplace to play for Surrey, and the county was happy to register him for the County Championship. [...] Fender attended to business matters before and after each day's play, and often combined Surrey's trips to away matches with business meetings. Socially, Fender became <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> in clubs and the theatre. He became friends with the actor Jack Hulbert and developed an interest in musical theatre, for which he provided financial support; he also wrote lyrics for some songs. By the end of the 1914 season, Fender had [...] convinced his father that he could successfully combine cricket and business. His improvement as a cricketer was recognised when was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for 1914.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bull", {{brought in}} his youth to watch {{football}} practices by his owner, high school student Bob Day who lived near the Yale Bowl, ascended to office when Handsome Dan IV died.

2500|$|In so doing, Labre was {{following}} {{in the role of}} the mendicant, the [...] "Fool-for-Christ," [...] found more often in the Eastern Church. He would often swoon when contemplating the crown of thorns, in particular, and, during these states, it is said he would levitate or bilocate. He was also said to have cured some of the other homeless he met and to have multiplied bread for them. [...] In the last years of his life (his thirties), he lived in Rome, for a time living in the ruins of the Colosseum, and would leave only to make a yearly pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Loreto. He was <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> in the city and known as the [...] "saint of the Forty Hours" [...] (or Quarant' Ore) for his dedication to Eucharistic adoration.|$|E

2500|$|He became <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> and {{striking}} <b>figure</b> on Broadway, and {{well known as}} an eccentric character. Clarke was an imitator of Byron and copied his airs and costumes, but not – as the New York Times archly put it – his verses.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not clear}} where the {{character}} of Stephano originated, though he is <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> clown <b>figure</b> typical of the era. There is one {{idea that he was}} modeled after Stephen Hopkins from London. Hopkins was aboard the Sea Venture when it was shipwrecked on Bermuda. He attempted to start a mutiny while stranded on the island. He eventually made it to Virginia and back to England, then went to Plymouth aboard the Mayflower.|$|R
2500|$|Charles Arthur [...] "Pretty Boy" [...] Floyd (February 3, 1904 – October 22, 1934) was an American bank robber. He {{operated}} in the Midwest and West South Central States, and his criminal exploits gained widespread press {{coverage in the}} 1930s. Like several other prominent outlaws of that era, he was pursued and killed by a group led by Melvin Purvis. Historians have speculated as to which officers were at the event, local or the FBI: known accounts document that local officers Robert [...] "Pete" [...] Pyle and George Curran were present at his fatal shooting and also at his embalming. Floyd has continued to be <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> in American popular culture, sometimes seen as notorious, but also at other times viewed as a tragic figure, partly {{a victim of the}} hard times of the Great Depression in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|... "Matthew Arnold," [...] wrote G. W. E. Russell in Portraits of the Seventies, is [...] "a man of {{the world}} entirely free from worldliness and a man of letters without the faintest trace of pedantry". Arnold was <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> at the Athenaeum Club, a {{frequent}} diner-out and guest at great country houses, fond of fishing and shooting, and a lively conversationalist, with a self-consciously cultivated air combining foppishness and Olympian grandeur. He read constantly, widely, and deeply, and in the intervals of supporting {{himself and his family}} by the quiet drudgery of school inspecting, filled notebook after notebook with meditations of an almost monastic tone. In his writings, he often baffled and sometimes annoyed his contemporaries by the apparent contradiction between his urbane, even frivolous manner in controversy, and the [...] "high seriousness" [...] of his critical views and the melancholy, almost plaintive note of much of his poetry. [...] "A voice poking fun in the wilderness" [...] was T. H. Warren's description of him.|$|E

5000|$|He became <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> and {{striking}} <b>figure</b> on Broadway, and {{well known as}} an eccentric character. Clarke was an imitator of Byron and copied his airs and costumes, but not - as the New York Times archly put it - his verses. Higgins suggests he embraced the mad poet role, in part {{as a means of}} entry into New York literary circles, and [...] "clearly relished his role as jester"; but later downplayed the role.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} dedramatize {{the debate on}} the {{question}} of the father, this article proposes a less alarming discussion on this issue. The aim is to point out that this notion is double: on the one hand, we have a father figure centered on organizational skills, who has authority delegated by society, and can be held by a man or a woman, and on the other hand a relational father, <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> father <b>figure</b> who's role today is more and more similar to a maternal role. We can assume that today all families can conceive and bring up children, be they hetero, homo or single parents, on condition that these two functions coexist, be they assumed by a single parent or by a couple.

5000|$|On 31 March 2016, {{the music}} video was {{uploaded}} on Azalea's Vevo channel. Directed by Fabien Montique, the visuals {{start off with}} Azalea making a break from a crowd in a Ferrari, narrowly escaping the stampede, performing donuts and burnouts to make her way to an airport where she heads through security before meeting up with her team, composed by dancers and supporters, on a private hangar. From there, everyone douses an aircraft in spray paint, covering it with graffiti tags related to her upcoming album [...] "Digital Distortion". Azalea is then also featured in a dance breakdown. The police eventually show up and escort Azalea inside the jet where she comes {{face to face with}} <b>an</b> eerily <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> with <b>a</b> digitally distorted face that she had encountered along the clip and is now recognized by herself.|$|R

60|$|Nicholls grunted but obeyed, and for {{the next}} few days Tavernake loafed.

It was Mr. Pritchard, in an American felt hat, and smoking a very black cigar. He leaned over and nodded to Tavernake, who was staring at him aghast.|$|E
60|$|She lunched alone, {{in a quiet}} {{corner of}} the dining-room {{of one of the}} large hotels, gazing at {{intervals}} absently out of the window. And {{by the middle of the}} afternoon she found herself, quite unexpectedly, in the antique furniture shop, gazing at the sideboard and a set of leather-seated Jacobean chairs, and bribing the dealer with a smile to hold them for a few days until she could decide whether she wished them. In a similar mood of abstraction she boarded the ferry, but it was not until the boat had started on its journey that she became aware of <b>a</b> trim, <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> in front of her, silhouetted against the ruffed blue waters of the river--Trixton Brent's. And presently, as though the concentration of her thoughts upon his back had summoned him, he turned.|$|R
60|$|Across a great {{vineyard}} plain, {{through which}} the narrow white road ran like a tightly drawn band of ribbon, I came presently {{to the village of}} Argueil. The street which led to the inn was paved with the most abominable cobbles, and I was forced to hold my hat with one hand and the side of the cart with the other. My blue-smocked driver pulled up with a flourish in front of the ancient gateway of the Leon d'Or, and I was very nearly precipitated on {{to the top of the}} broad-backed horse. As I gathered myself together I was conscious of a soft peal of laughter--a woman's laughter, which came from the arched entrance to the inn. I looked up quickly. <b>A</b> too <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> was standing there watching me,--Lady Delahaye, trim, elegant, a trifle supercilious. By her side stood the innkeeper, white-aproned and obsequious.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of his long, {{distinguished}} career, Geza Vermes, the first professor of Jewish Studies at Oxford university, has made a major contribution {{to our understanding of the}} historical Jesus. In Christian Beginnings, as in his groundbreaking work Jesus the Jew (1973), he shows that Jesus would have been <b>a</b> recognisable and <b>familiar</b> <b>figure</b> to his contemporaries. A healer, exorcist and compelling preacher, he was the latest in a line of charismatic prophets who existed for centuries alongside the established priestly tradition and offered an alternative form of Judaism, based on vision, ecstasy and miraculous healing, and frequently in conflict with the Israelite ruling class.|$|R
