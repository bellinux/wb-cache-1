5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is <b>a</b> <b>high-performance</b> V8 {{version of}} the British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, {{designed}} in part by American car designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced.|$|E
