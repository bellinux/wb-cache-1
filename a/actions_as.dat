5|$|Juan Davis Bradburn (1787 – April 20, 1842), born John Davis Bradburn, was a {{brigadier general}} in the Mexican Army. His <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> commandant of the {{garrison}} at Anahuac in Mexican Texas in 1831 and 1832 led to the events known as the Anahuac Disturbances.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Paul, Tipu {{shifted his}} hatred for the British to the Mangalorean Catholics and other South Indian Christian communities. Sita Ram Goel mentions that Tipu's {{justification for the}} conversion was that during the Portuguese domination, many Muslims were forcibly converted to Christianity. Tipu proclaimed his <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> a punishment for the conversion of Muslims to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|After {{joining the}} National Liberal Party (PNL), {{he was elected}} to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in November 1919, {{representing}} Gorj County. Among his first notable <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> a politician was an initiative to interpellate Nicolae L. Lupu, the Minister of Interior Affairs Ministry in the Romanian National Party-Peasants' Party cabinet, in answer to concerns that the executive was tolerating socialist agitation in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> emperor were {{described}} as being especially harsh to the senate, to the nobility and to the equestrian order. According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed conspiracies against Caligula. Eventually, officers within the Praetorian Guard led by Cassius Chaerea succeeded in murdering the emperor. The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the senate, army and equestrian order {{were said to have}} been informed of it and involved in it.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E

5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he thought he could control McCreary's <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's <b>actions,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as the}} {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|In England, Parliament held James {{abandoned}} the throne by fleeing from English territory to France. The Convention argued James forfeited the Scottish throne by his <b>actions,</b> <b>as</b> {{listed in the}} Articles of Grievances. This effectively rejected {{the principle of the}} Divine Right of Kings which had driven political conflict for the last 60 years. If James could be removed from the throne because of his acts, monarchs derived their legitimacy not from God but the people as represented by Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{elections}} of 1970, Tydings faced criticism from both parties for his <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> senator. In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left stemmed from his support of a crime bill for the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at the bill for writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August, {{the central}} {{government}} decided not {{to intervene in the}} suspension of Nagpal, as she did not appeal or challenge the suspension order given by the Uttar Pradesh government. Since Nagpal's suspension on 27 July, the Centre had issued three reminders to the UP government, seeking a detailed report. On 4 August, the UP government had sent a report on Nagpal's suspension to the DoPT and had served a chargesheet to Nagpal, which deemed her <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> unwarranted and in violation of rules.|$|E

He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> General Manager.|$|E
5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> {{the result of}} societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence {{in the media and}} in society may have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E
5|$|Progress {{remained}} slow through 1991 and 1992.

The regime frequently used violence {{as a tool to}} hamper reform, justifying its <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> anti-RPF security measures.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona's European contemporaries {{generally}} condemned her {{policies and}} characterized {{her as a}} tyrant at best and insane at worst. These negative characterizations persisted in foreign scholarly literature until the mid-1970s.

5|$|Since {{the work}} of Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote {{in the years before}} 1154 and who {{regarded}} Stephen's <b>actions</b> <b>as</b> treachery against the clergy that earned him punishment from God, Alexander's arrest has been seen by many historians as a turning point in Stephen's reign. Writing in the 1870s, the historian William Stubbs felt that the arrest destroyed the royal administration, but modern historians have advanced differing explanations for the troubles that followed, not all of which are related to the bishop's arrest.|$|E
