40|$|Coventry University is {{pioneering}} {{the integration}} of hypermedia into the curriculum for the teaching of Italian language and society {{with the creation of}} a package based on Nerino Rossi's novel La neve nel bicchiere. The novel was already in use as a basic course text, and developing a hypermedia package was felt to be the ideal way of creating a more stimulating means of access to it. The procedure used in creating the package is described, as are its contents, {{the ways in which the}} students use it and the tasks they are given to perform, the feedback from the students, and its impact on their performance. The testing of the prototype has helped in creating a new cognitive model: the FREE (Fluid Role-Exchange Environment) which functions as a fluid and interactive 'pool ' where the three main actors, or <b>act</b> <b>ants,</b> ie. the learner, the lecturer and the computer, exchange roles. Within the FREE, students were involved in the construction and evaluation of the courseware, as well as testing the various versions of the prototype. The development and use of hypermedia inside and outside the classroom has made it possible to change both the students ' and the lecturer's attitude towards the material being learnt. However, the courseware does not seem to equip students sufficiently for essay writing, and this problem needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|The Arabidopsis AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) gene {{has been}} shown {{previously}} {{to be involved in}} ovule development and in the initiation and growth of floral organs. Here, we show that <b>ANT</b> <b>acts</b> in additional processes during flower development, including repression of AGAMOUS (AG) in second whorl cells, promotion of petal epidermal cell identity, and gynoecium development. Analyses of ap 2 - 1 ant- 6 double mutants reveal that <b>ANT</b> <b>acts</b> redundantly with AP 2 to repress AG in second whorl cells. The abaxial surface of ant petals contains features such as stomata and elongated, interdigitated cells that are not present on wild-type petals. The loss of petal identity in these second whorl cells does not result from ectopic AG expression, suggesting that <b>ANT</b> <b>acts</b> in a pathway promoting petal cell identity that is independent of its role in repression of AG. These data suggest that ANT may function as a class A gene...|$|R

25|$|Polybia sericea are {{generally}} docile wasps, {{and will not}} attack other organisms unless they are stimulated. When they are attacked, however, they may chase predators up to 15 meters away from the nest. In addition they may sting and bite the predator. The magnitude of a defense response {{is proportional to the}} energetic investment by the colony in rearing individuals, and also {{to the size of the}} colony. More individuals are likely to attack a predator if there are more adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae in the nest, because the colony has already made a large investment in developing itself. Polybia sericea relies upon active defense to defend their nest from ants, whereas other species produce glandular secretions that <b>act</b> as <b>ant</b> repellant to deter ants from entering the nest.|$|R

40|$|Lateral organs in {{flowering}} plants display polarity along their adaxial-abaxial axis with distinct cell types forming at different positions along this axis. Members of three classes of transcription factors in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; the Class III homeodomain/leucine zipper [HD-ZIP] proteins, KANADI proteins, and YABBY proteins) {{are expressed in}} either the adaxial or abaxial domain of organ primordia where they confer these respective identities. Little {{is known about the}} factors that act upstream of these polarity-determining genes to regulate their expression. We have investigated the relationship between AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), a gene that promotes initiation and growth of lateral organ primordia, and polarity genes. Although ant single mutants do not display any obvious defects in organ polarity, loss of ANT activity in combination with mutations in one or more YABBY genes results in polarity defects greater than those observed in the yabby mutants alone. Our results suggest that <b>ANT</b> <b>acts</b> in combination with the YABBY gene FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL) to promote organ polarity by up-regulating the expression of the adaxial-specifying HD-ZIP gene PHABULOSA. Furthermore, we show that <b>ANT</b> <b>acts</b> with FIL to up-regulate expression of the floral homeotic gene APETALA 3.

50|$|Embolemidae is a {{small family}} of around 20 species and 2 genera {{distributed}} around the world. They are small, sometimes very small, solitary wasps. The biology of the Embolemidae is little known, although a Nearctic species, Embolemus confusuus, was reared from the nymph of a planthopper from the family Achilidae where its host fed on fungi beneath the bark of rotting logs. The parasitoid lived in a bulging sac attached to the host nymph between {{the second and third}} segments. The females are wingless while the males have wings and in temperate regions emerge later than the females, which overwinter as adults. The wingless females have been recorded from the nests of ants and small mammal burrows, or under stones in pastures and grasslands and they appear to <b>act</b> as <b>ant</b> mimics. The Palearctic species, Embolemus ruddii has been found in association with the ant species Formica fusca and Lasius flavus, while in Japan Embolemus walkeri was taken in a nest of another ant from the genus Myrmica.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The Ad Hoc {{network has}} {{attracted}} {{more and more}} attention with its good performance and special application. Many transactions, such as real-time multimedia and audio-video transmission have strict demand for QoS parameters, which requires that we find a QoS routing in multi-constrained conditions. Generally, multiconstrained QoS routing is an NP-Complete problem. The drawbacks of the ad hoc networkâ€”poor quality of network links, frequent topology change and low capacity, make it more complicated for the QoS guarantee because the time and information needed for the algorithm to search path is relatively limited. We propose a modified ant colony algorithm based on the orientation factor to solve multi-constrained QoS routing problem by recurring to GPS location. This algorithm employs the orientation factor to adjust the search <b>act</b> of <b>ants</b> and update pheromones according to objective function values, thus guaranteeing the speed and effeciency of the searchï¼Œand avoiding falling into local optimization. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} algorithm proposed in this paper has good performance in computing speed and reduction of control information amount...|$|R

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the <b>ants</b> <b>act</b> as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae.
