This process is typically achieved through a coupling agent that links <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface to}} a reactive group on either of the chain termini. Although simple, this approach suffers from the disadvantage of a relatively low grafting density {{as a result of}} steric hindrance from the already-attached polymer coils. After coupling, as in all cases, polymers attempt to maximize their entropy typically by assuming a brush or mushroom conformation. Thus, potential binding sites become inaccessible beneath this “mushroom domain”.|$|E
25|$|Russolo built these {{instruments}} {{to perform the}} music outlined in his Art of Noises manifesto. The instruments were completely acoustic, not electronic. The boxes had various types of internal construction to create different types of noise. Often a wheel was touching a string attached to a drum. The wheel rattled or bowed the strings, while the drum functioned as an acoustic resonator. Many of the instruments featured <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> top of the box, which was used to vary the string tension. Pulling the handle raised the tone, and the horn attached to the box amplified the sound. Intonarumori ('noise makers' in Italian) made noise, but not at a very loud volume, since they were all acoustic devices.|$|E

25|$|Changing {{times and}} the rise of {{television}} saw Mondt's influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able to get <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> television like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt's gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capital. Mondt died nearly penniless on June 11, 1976 at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness.

25|$|Archaeologists {{working at}} Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture {{settlement}} {{located near the}} modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> {{one side and a}} tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the Ilex vomitoria. The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.|$|E

McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do".

To get <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E

Club gave the episode a B+, {{and felt that}} it gave an accurate depiction of the characters. He opined: [...] "I {{had a problem with}} the show's tendency to wander into cul-de-sacs in the first season, mainly because so much of it felt redundant, the work of writers who had no real idea how to construct narrative television. But this season, I'm starting to think they're getting <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> things, and [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] is the sort of episode I'd like to see more off [...] as The Walking Dead continues." [...] Paste Josh Jackson asserted that the episode was superior to preceding installments, describing it as [...] "simply a catch of breath." [...] Similarly, Josh Wigler of MTV evaluated that despite less violence than usual, the quality of [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] improved from the previous episode. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed analogous sentiments, and argued that while the show's character still need more development, the development displayed in the episode was a [...] "definite {{step in the right direction}} on that front." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings concluded that the episode contained many powerful scenes. Eric Goldman of IGN was critical of the episode, ultimately giving it a seven out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "good" [...] rating.

[...] Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart praised {{the first volume}} as [...] "a highly enjoyable read". Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux described the series as [...] "belong to a fantasy subgenre {{sometimes referred to as}} 'pop Gothic' and relying on atmosphere and looks. Critics praised the art of Bizenghast as detailed, but did not see it as manga-styled. Anime Jumps Chad Clayton called the series [...] "heavily steeped in the gothic tradition" [...] and commented that the series [...] "successfully develops an inventive visual style all its own. It seems to owe more to classical art, gothic comics, and even artists like Edward Gorey than it does to manga." [...] Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly, found the art reminiscent [...] "of classic fantasy indy comics" [...] and noted [...] "stock elements" [...] in the story. Reviewers found Dinah's character design [...] "striking" [...] and with the potential to appeal to fans of the Gothic Lolita fashion. Criticism focused on the writing, [...] "uneven pacing", flat characters, and the varying quality of the art. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy heavily criticized Bizenghast for the [...] "slightly modified generic monster-of-the-week cliché" [...] plot, one-dimensional characters, and art. David Welsh compared Bizenghast to [...] "a cosplay of a horror manga", and wrote: [...] "It’s got <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> the cosmetics, but central elements of story and character are vague and underdeveloped." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the leg, {{the band}} members were having trouble {{adjusting}} to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother's Milk approached 500,000 units sold. Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling inside. I wasn't proud of who I was then." [...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea's arrest worsened Kiedis' impending charge in Virginia from the [...] "Positive Mental Octopus" [...] tour, for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> {{reversible}} <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> graphene carrier density, {{other than}} the gate electric field, is desirable for memory applications of graphene. Our experiments show that the commonly observed carrier density hysteresis in graphene on SiO$_ 2 $ due to interface water/oxygen vanishes at temperatures below 250 K. The state of these species, which affects the graphene carrier density, at low temperatures can be reversibly controlled by thermal cycling to room temperature at different gate voltages. Further, devices prepared with relatively dry interface, and thus showing negligible hysteresis at room temperature, show a marked increase in hysteresis on heating above room temperature. Thus thermal-cycling, to high temperatures and under gate-voltage, provides <b>a</b> reversible <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> carrier density.
