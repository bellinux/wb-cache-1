40|$|Attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> are {{analyzed}} as verbal behavior. It {{is argued that}} shaping by a verbal community {{is an essential part}} of the formation and maintenance of both attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> <b>and</b> it is suggested that verbal communities mediate the important shift in control from events in the environment (attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> as tacts) to control by other words (attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> as intraverbals). It appears that both attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> are constantly being socially negotiated through autoclitic functions. That is, verbal communities reinforce (a) reporting general rather than specific attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> (b) presentation of intraverbals as if they were tacts, and (c) presentation of beliefs as if they were attitudes. Consistency among <b>and</b> between attitudes, <b>beliefs,</b> <b>and</b> behavior is also contingent upon the reinforcing practices of verbal communities. Thus, attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> can be studied as social behavior rather than as private, cognitive processes...|$|R
40|$|Differences between {{assumptions}} <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> {{related to}} eating disorders were investigated in {{young women and}} young men, with and without a history of dieting. The unique predictive power of these assumptions <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> was also assessed, compared to generic assumptions <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Both women <b>and</b> men {{with a history of}} dieting scored more highly than those who had never dieted on assumptions related to weight, shape, and eating, but did not differ from this group in negative self-beliefs. Assumptions <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> related to eating disorders, as well as female gender, but not body mass index (BMI), history of dieting, or generic assumptions <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> predicted eating disorder-related symptoms. The findings add to knowledge about the relationship between assumptions <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> gender, dieting, <b>and</b> eating disorder-related symptoms.

40|$|The outputs of {{political}} processes, i. e. policy, reflect rational cost-benefit calculations and power relationships, {{but are also}} shaped by the values <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> of policy actors, i. e. sovereigns, involved in the decision-making process. Values <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> affect how rational analyses and power relationships are understood and valued by sovereigns. This article suggests that understanding sovereigns’ values <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> is, however, necessary but insufficient for understanding concrete policy outputs, particularly in complex policy processes characterized by conflicting interests and values. In such cases, sovereigns are forced to prioritize among their values <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> This article proposes a framework for studying how sovereigns prioritize among their values <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> This framework is then used to study a complex policy process ridden with conflicts of interest and value-conflicts, which highlights the value and necessity of studying sovereigns, their values <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> {{as well as the}} prioritizations they make among those values <b>and</b> <b>beliefs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Even {{cities and}} states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their {{merchant}} Republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{religion}} {{in the eighteenth century}} includes all forms of religious organisation <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in Scotland in the eighteenth century. This period saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had been created in the Reformation and established on a fully Presbyterian basis after the Glorious Revolution. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession and headed by figures including Ebenezer Erskine, {{led to the creation of}} a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 led to the foundation of the independent Relief Church.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} hearing {{behaviors of}} adults seeking {{help for the}} first time through the application of two models of health behavior change: the transtheoretical model <b>and</b> the health <b>belief</b> model. Design: The relationships between attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> were examined relative to hearing-aid uptake and outcomes six months later. Study sample: One hundred and sixty adults completed the University of Rhode Island change assessment (targeting the transtheoretical model), <b>and</b> the hearing <b>beliefs</b> questionnaire (targeting the health belief model), as well as the hearing handicap inventory and the psychosocial impact of hearing loss scale, within two months of an initial hearing assessment. Six months later, participants completed these same questionnaires, while those who had taken up hearing aids also completed hearing-aid outcome questionnaires. Results: (1) Attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> were associated with future hearing-aid uptake, and were effective at modeling this behavior; (2) attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> changed following behavior change, and (3) attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> following behavior change were better predictors of hearing-aid outcomes than pre-behavior change attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Conclusion: A counseling-based intervention targeting the attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> assessed by the transtheoretical model <b>and</b> the health <b>belief</b> model has the potential to increase uptake of hearing health care.

5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
5|$|Yoga and Vedanta are the {{two largest}} {{surviving}} schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style {{and some of their}} methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways. Yoga disputes the monism of Advaita Vedanta. Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and jivanmukti.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{religion}} {{in the seventeenth century}} includes all forms of religious organisation <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in the Kingdom of Scotland in the seventeenth century. During the sixteenth century, Scotland had undergone a Protestant Reformation that created a predominately Calvinist national kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook. James VI favoured doctrinal Calvinism, but also episcopacy. His son Charles I authorised a book of canons that made him head of the Church and enforced the use of a new liturgy, seen as an English-style Prayer Book. In the resulting rebellion the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church and representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the National Covenant. In the subsequent Bishop's Wars the Scottish Covenanters emerged as virtually independent rulers. Charles I's failure led indirectly to the English civil war (1642–46). The Covenanters intervened on the side of Parliament, who were victorious, but became increasingly alienated from the Parliamentary regime. The Scottish defeats in the subsequent Second and Third civil wars, led to English occupation and incorporation in a Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland led by Oliver Cromwell from 1652 and the imposition of religious toleration for Protestants. The Scottish Covenanters divided into parties of Resolutioners and Protesters.|$|E
5|$|The early Bhagavata {{writings}} in Sanskrit by well-known acharyas (gurus) were solely {{meant to}} have a proselytising effect on the masses, encouraging them to a theistic way of life <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in the god Krishna. Chatu Vitthalanatha, who flourished as a court poet of King Krishnadeva Raya and his successor King Achyuta Raya, {{was the first to}} translate the Bhagavata into Kannada in a voluminous writing comprising 12,247 stanzas divided into 280 sections. The work covered the entire original version in shatpadi metre. Two other names appear in the colophons, Sadananda Yati and Nityatma Sukayogi, prompting some scholars to attribute the work to the group while others consider them alternate names of the same writer. The work covers all ten avatars of the god Vishnu, though it is essentially centred on the depiction of Krishna as the supreme Lord. The purana covers stories of Vishnu's famous devotees such as Prahlad and Dhruva in detail, as well as stories of demons Vritasura, Hiranyakashipu and others who sought to attain salvation by dying at the hands of Vishnu. Most noteworthy is the epic's influence on the compositions of the Haridasas. Though the writing is not considered as important as the other two epics of the period, its significance to religiously minded people is well accepted. Chatu Vitthalanatha wrote a fuller version of portions of the epic Mahabharata as well. Other notable writers of the 16th century were Tirumala Bhatta (Siva Gite) and Ramendra (Saundarya Katharatna, using tripadi metre).|$|E

Varying reports on teachers’ perception of epilepsy abound. Furthermore previous research has shown that urbanization and differences in socio-cultural environments could also influence teachers’ perception of epilepsy. A few studies have explored the knowledge, attitude <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> of schoolteachers towards epilepsy in urban schools in Nigeria. This study was undertaken to examine teachers’ perception of epilepsy in the rural communities with regards to knowledge, attitude <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> A cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered questionnaire, was carried out among rural community primary and secondary schoolteachers in schools randomly selected from three local government areas in Enugu. One hundred and twenty five teachers correctly completed their questionnaires. Despite a fairly high level of education of the teachers, the mean overall score for correct response for knowledge was 59. 2 %. A majority of the teachers had negative attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> None had received any form of health education on epilepsy. The level of education significantly affected various aspects of knowledge, attitudes <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> This study concluded that paucity of good knowledge of epilepsy probably resulted in negative attitude <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> despite the teachers’ high level of education...|$|R
