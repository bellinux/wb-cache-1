5|$|Domains are <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> grouping. First {{proposed}} in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system {{was not generally}} accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E

Currently, there are two segments of freeway. The first one, begins at an at grade interchange with I-17 (a stack interchange is to be constructed). This freeway status continues, with occasional interchanges at Lake Pleasant Parkway, Lone Mountain Parkway, and Happy Valley Parkway (many others are planned), until El Mirage Road.|$|E

5|$|In Yugoslavia, Meyszner was {{no longer}} able to access his pension and had few assets, and worked as the {{cultural}} policy chief of the centre for Nazi fugitives. He travelled to Germany by sea in November 1934. He first went to the camp for Nazi fugitives at Rummelsburg in Pomerania, before transferring to a similar facility in Berlin. Once in Germany, he submitted his résumé to the Allgemeine SS. At the time, the Allgemeine SS was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> paramilitary arm of the German Nazi Party that was overtaking the SA in importance. In his résumé, he emphasised his experience as a political organiser and speaker and suggested that a purely military task would not make best use of his knowledge and skills.|$|E

5|$|In many societies, beer is {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer. Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular. <b>A</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.|$|E
5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} comics are <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from {{the content of}} comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children. With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US {{took the form of}} subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.|$|E
5|$|National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) are <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> {{invention}} in {{the park}} system. Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area, created in 2015, is the only unit that uses this designation in its name. Fathom Five National Marine Park was created in 1987, prior to the NMCA concept, and subsequently classified as an NMCA without changing its legal name. The case of Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park is similar, while Gwaii Haanas is an NMCA Reserve, {{with the intention of}} becoming an NMCA.|$|E

5|$|One {{of their}} {{innovative}} features was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow, named after its inventor, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, {{who served as}} Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result {{of a series of}} towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.|$|E

5|$|Though Eastbourne is <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> town, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age. The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner, William Cavendish, later to become the Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town, but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration. The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne.|$|E

5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new,</b> cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} days tourism was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> concept, but grew slowly before {{exploding}} {{with the advent}} of air travel around 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations, and Kīlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less constant state of moderate eruption, is {{a major part of the}} island's tourist draw. Today, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offers the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access. In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in Kalapana on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.|$|E
5|$|The decathlon was <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> {{event in}} modern athletics, {{although}} it {{had been part of}} American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the 1904 St.Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he could run the 100-yard dash in 10seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8seconds; the 440 in 51.8seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24seconds. He could long jump 23ft 6in and high-jump 6ft 5in. He could pole vault 11feet; put the shot 47ft 9in; throw the javelin 163feet; and throw the discus 136feet.|$|E
