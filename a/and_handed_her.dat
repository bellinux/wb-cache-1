Tired {{of doing so}} without help, Surratt moved to her townhouse in Washington, D.C., which she then ran as a boardinghouse. There, she was {{introduced}} to John Wilkes Booth. Booth visited the boardinghouse numerous times, as did George Atzerodt and Lewis Powell, Booth's co-conspirator in the Lincoln assassination.

25|$|The HMS Hermione was a frigate of the Royal Navy, {{commanded}} by Captain Hugh Pigot. In September 1797 {{a number of}} the crew had risen up against the tyrannical Pigot and had murdered him and nine other officers, throwing their bodies overboard. Fearing retribution for their actions, the mutineers had sailed the HMS Hermione to the Spanish port of La Guaira, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to the Spanish. The mutineers claimed they had set the officers adrift in a small boat, as had happened in the mutiny on the Bounty some eight years earlier.|$|E

25|$|Salerno {{played a}} {{conspicuous}} {{part in the}} fall of the Norman Kingdom. After the Emperor Henry VI's invasion on behalf of his wife, Constance, the heiress to the kingdom, in 1191, Salerno surrendered and promised loyalty on the mere news of an incoming army. This so disgusted the archbishop, Nicolò d'Aiello, that he abandoned the city and fled to Naples, which held out in a siege. In 1194, the situation reversed itself: Naples capitulated, along with most other cities of the Mezzogiorno, and only Salerno resisted. It was sacked and pillaged, much reducing its importance and prosperity. Henry had his reasons, though. He had entrusted Constance to the citizens and after his retreat from invasion in 1191 they had received letters about the events from Nicolò and betrayed Henry, attacked Constance at Castel Terracena <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to King Tancredi of Sicily, making the Empress captive for nearly one year. Her combined treachery and stubbornness cost Salerno much after the Hohenstaufen conquest. Henry's son, Frederick II, moreover, issued a series of edicts that reduced Salerno's role in favour of Naples (in particular, the foundation of the University of Naples in that city).|$|E

25|$|The Hermione was {{a former}} frigate of the Royal Navy, {{commanded}} by Captain Hugh Pigot. In September 1797 {{a number of the}} crew had risen up against the apparently tyrannical Pigot and had murdered him and nine other officers, throwing their bodies overboard. Fearing retribution for their actions, the mutineers had sailed the Hermione to the Spanish port of La Guaira, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to the authorities. When news of the mutiny reached Parker, he demanded the return of the ship and the surrender of the mutineers, instigating a process that would eventually see the apprehending of 33 of them. The Hermione meanwhile had been renamed Santa Cecilia, but remained in port. News eventually reached Parker that the Santa Cecilia had been sighted in Puerto Cabello, and ordered the Surprise to intercept her, should she attempt to put to sea. Hamilton decided that the honour of the Royal Navy depended on the recovery of the ship, and was determined to retake her. Anchoring near the port he devised a plan to cut her out of the harbour and asked for a boat and an extra 20 men from Parker. Parker declared the scheme too risky, and refused to send the men, but Hamilton went ahead anyway.|$|E

Tweedie recalled their conversation revolved around his new posting and his book. He had delivered the manuscript to Mr Grey two days earlier and was expecting its publication. While there, McCudden promised to surpass von Richthofen who had been killed in action on 21 April 1918. In view of what happened to von Richthofen, and John McCudden, he promised that [...] "I won't bustle, or do anything foolish like my brother". He then went next door and had breakfast with his sister Mary. Upon leaving, he fumbled around in his pocket <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> a bulky envelope containing his Victoria Cross and other decorations. He took his leave of her and drove to Hounslow where he climbed into his S.E.5a (C1126). He took off shortly after 13:00. McCudden certainly stopped en route, as about six o'clock that afternoon he called the AOC No. 13 Wing, Patrick Playfair, to announce his imminent arrival at Boffles, where No. 60 Squadron was stationed.|$|E

500|$|On 11 September 2010, Beth Holloway and De Vries {{traveled}} to Peru with a Dutch television crew {{to visit the}} prison. According to Navarro, his client was taken to meet them [...] "practically by force." [...] Navarro stated that the meeting with Holloway took [...] "less than one minute." [...] Holloway said that she told Van der Sloot that she had [...] "no hate in her soul" [...] for him and asked about her daughter's disappearance, to which Van der Sloot responded he could not speak to her without his lawyer present <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> Navarro's business card. According to Navarro, Holloway was [...] "snuck" [...] into the prison without identifying to the Dutch TV crew who she was. A prison spokesperson stated that Holloway's name was {{not found in the}} visitor registry. Holloway and the crew were removed from the prison, reportedly after a hidden camera was discovered by the guards. Representatives for Holloway and De Vries denied that a hidden camera was involved or that anything was seized. Miguel Castro Castro prison warden Alex Samamé Peña was suspended after video segments of the confrontation between Holloway's mother and Van der Sloot later began airing on Dutch network SBS6.|$|E

A secondary intent was to reduce {{the economic impact of}} the millions of veterans returning to the workforce by staggering their reentry. On June 22, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed [...] "The Servicemen's Readjustment Act", which became Public Law 78-346 <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> the first pen.
