2500|$|The Hindi version {{received}} notably mixed responses, {{with most}} of the reviewers criticising Swanand Kirkire's lyrics. Bollywood Hungama rated the album 1.5 out of 5 saying, [...] "Robot disappoints. While Rahman himself hasn't come up with anything exceptional, something which is expected from him film after film; it's the lyrics that are chief culprit here. It is clear that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> lost in translation here, literally so, as the song dubbing Tamil to Hindi just doesn't work here." [...] Glamsham published a positive review saying, [...] "Robot is stylishly packed sci-fi musical entertainer, exuding out multifaceted classy acts from the maestro. Its herculean effort to compile and compose a set of situational soundtracks with that extra trendy grace and poise but Robot delivers all with style, thanks to A.R Rahman's ever-reliable expertise." [...] Rediff rated the Hindi version 2.5 on 5 and commented that Robot is not Rahman's best, to say the least. The Times of India commented that [...] "On the whole, the music of Robot does not appeal. They may suit the script of the sci-film, but the audio is not impressive." ...|$|E

Deriding this show simply because it is hosted by a Bollywood actor who is also a marketing whiz, questions our credibility, not his." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> made of Caravaggio's presumed homosexuality, {{which has}} {{in more than}} one {{previous}} account of his life been presented as the single key that explains everything, both the power of his art and the misfortunes of his life. There is no absolute proof of it, only strong circumstantial evidence and much rumour. The balance of probability suggests that Caravaggio did indeed have sexual relations with men. But he certainly had female lovers. Throughout the years that he spent in Rome he kept close company with a number of prostitutes. The truth is that Caravaggio was as uneasy in his relationships as he was in most other aspects of life. He likely slept with men. He did sleep with women. He settled with no one... but the idea that he was an early martyr to the drives of an unconventional sexuality is an anachronistic fiction.|$|E
