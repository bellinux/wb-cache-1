The stability characteristics of a supersonic boundary layer over a sharp cone with 50 half-angle at 2 degrees angle of attack is investigated.

We used two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight (GCxGC-ToF) mass spectrometry combined with multivariate statistics to parse volatiles into regulatory patterns. Volatiles released by wounding alone and by the alkalinity of OS were assessed by applying a buffer known to mimic the pH-mediated changes of OS elicitation (pectin methyl esterase activation and methanol release). The activities of fatty acid amino acid conjugates, well-known elicitors of antiherbivore defenses, and of 2 -hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid, a newly discovered signal in OS, were determined. Approximately 400 analytes were detected after deconvolution and alignment of GCxGC data; 35 volatiles were significantly regulated upon W+OS. Two-thirds of these were specifically regulated by OS, being either <b>amplified</b> (<b>most</b> terpenoids and certain hexenylesters) or strongly repressed (many short-chain alcohols and some aromatic and hexenylester derivatives). Fatty acid amino acid conjugates {{played a central role in}} this pattern of regulation, since they induced the emission of half of OS-elicited volatiles and inhibited the production of almost all OS-repressed volatiles; 2 -hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid influenced emission of trans-α-bergamotene, while other unknown OS constituents amplified hexenylester production.

Re-emergence of West Nile virus in Europe and continuous spread of certain flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses represent a global danger to public health.

Results: Two degenerate primers and one Locked-Nucleic Acids probe were designed to <b>amplify</b> <b>most</b> of the flaviviruses. To increase the specificity and fluorescence signal of the Pan-Flavi assay for detection of yellow fever virus and dengue virus 4, additional primers and probes were included. Viral RNA of thirty different flaviviruses was detected, verifying the broad range specificity. The testing of this assay was successful, using standard plasmid and RNA dilutions of yellow fever virus vaccine strain, dengue virus 1 and tick-borne encephalitis virus, with a sensitivity limit of 10 – 100 genome copies/reaction.

Signal amplification HPV-DNA detection techniques (Hybrid Capture II, Digene Corporation, USA) are standardized, commercially available, and capable of detecting several high-risk HPV types. They also increase the sensitivity of screening for high-grade lesions in combination with cytology. The sensitivity of these techniques to detect high-grade lesions is {{higher than that of}} cytology, but the referral rate for colposcopy is greater. These techniques are approved for the triage to colposcopy of women with cervical smears interpreted as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Triage and screening for cervical cancer using HPV will probably be restricted to women aged 30 years or older because of the high prevalence of infection in younger women. Amplification techniques are ideal for epidemiological studies because they minimize the misclassification of HPV infection status. These techniques can detect low HPV burden infections. Consensus primers <b>amplify</b> <b>most</b> genital types in one reaction, and the reverse hybridization of amplicons with type-specific probes allows for the typing of HPV-positive samples. Consensus PCR assays are currently under evaluation for diagnostic purposes. HPV testing is currently implemented for the clinical management of women...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{exists as}} {{a swarm of}} genetically {{distinct}} but related variants, or a quasispecies, whose complexity and sequence evolution are critical to studies of viral pathogenesis. Because most studies of the HCV quasispecies have focused on a relatively small genomic segment, the first hypervariable region of the E 2 gene, {{it is possible that}} viral complexity is occasionally underestimated (due to primer mismatch) and that sequence evolution is misperceived due to unrecognized covariation. This report describes a sensitive and reproducible method to <b>amplify</b> <b>most</b> of the HCV genome as a single 5. 2 -kb amplicon by using primers directed at relatively conserved genomic segments. Using 52 specimens obtained during acute infection over a range of viral RNA concentrations, the overall rate of successful amplification was 94 % and varied in a concentration-dependent manner, with successful amplification in 26 of 26 (100 %) specimens at greater than 105 IU/ml, 15 of 16 (94 %) at 104 to 105 IU/ml, 6 of 7 (86 %) at 103 to 104 IU/ml, and 2 of 3 (67 %) at less than 103 IU/ml. Quasispecies complexity, determined by using this novel long-amplicon method followed by heteroduplex mobility assay combined with single-stranded conformational polymorphism (HDA+SSCP) analysis, was very high, even during acute HCV infection, when 10 to 21 (median, 16) different HDA+SSCP patterns were detected among 33 cDNA clones examined. Replicate analyses indicate that this diversity is not dominated by random errors generated during amplification. Therefore, the HCV quasispecies is highly complex even during acute infection and is accurately represented in amplicons representing {{more than half of the}} viral genome...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{temporal}} {{stability of the}} Orr–Sommerfeld and Squire equations in channels with turbulent mean velocity profiles and turbulent eddy viscosities. Friction Reynolds numbers up to Reτ = 2 × 104 are considered. All the eigensolutions of the problem are damped, but initial perturbations with wavelengths λx> λz can grow temporarily before decaying. The <b>most</b> <b>amplified</b> solutions reproduce the organization of turbulent structures in actual channels, including their self-similar spreading in the logarithmic region. The typical widths of the near-wall streaks and of the large-scale structures of the outer layer, λ+z = 100 and λz/h= 3, are predicted well. The dynamics of the <b>most</b> <b>amplified</b> solutions is roughly the same regardless of the wavelength of the perturbations and of the Reynolds number. They start with a wall-normal v event which does not grow but which forces streamwise velocity fluctuations by stirring the mean shear (uv < 0). The resulting u fluctuations grow significantly and last longer than the v ones, and contain nearly all the kinetic energy at the instant of maximum amplification. 1...|$|R
