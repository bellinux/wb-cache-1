40|$|Abstract—Fast <b>frequency</b> <b>acquisition</b> {{is crucial}} for phase-locked loops (PLLs) used in {{portable}} devices, as on-chip clocks are frequently scaled down or up in order to manage power consumption. This paper describes a new <b>frequency</b> <b>acquisition</b> method that is effective in all-digital PLLs (ADPLLs). To achieve fast <b>frequency</b> <b>acquisition,</b> the codeword of the digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) is predicted by measuring the variations of process, supply voltage and temperature (PVT). A PVT sensor implemented with a ring oscillator is employed to monitor the variations. As the sensor frequency at the current operating condition {{is directly related to}} the PVT variations, the sensor frequency is taken into account to compensate such variations in predicting the DCO codeword. The proposed method enables one-cycle <b>frequency</b> <b>acquisition,</b> and the <b>frequency</b> error is less than 1. 5 %.

One view assumes a trade-off between probabilities and outcomes (or nonlinear functions thereof) and the separate evaluation of risky options (expectation models). Another view assumes that risky choice {{is based on}} comparative evaluation, limited search, aspiration levels, and the forgoing of trade-offs (heuristic models). We derived quantitative process predictions for a generic expectation model and for a specific heuristic model, namely the priority heuristic (Brandst&# 228;tter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006), and tested them in two experiments. The focus was on two key features of the cognitive process: <b>acquisition</b> <b>frequencies</b> (i. e., how frequently individual reasons are looked up) and direction of search (i. e., gamble-wise vs. reason-wise). In Experiment 1, the priority heuristic predicted direction of search better than the expectation model (although neither model predicted the acquisition process perfectly); <b>acquisition</b> <b>frequencies,</b> however, were inconsistent with both models. Additional analyses revealed that these frequencies were primarily a function of what Rubinstein (1988) called similarity. In Experiment 2, the quantitative model comparison approach showed that people seemed to rely more on the priority heuristic in difficult problems, but to make more trade-offs in easy problems.

Recently some studies have successfully applied image techniques to {{the determination of the}} velocity field in dam-break flows. The next step should then be the study of the turbulence characteristics of such flow. Turbulent measurements require enough data to perform meaningful statistics.
