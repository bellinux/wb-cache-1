The questionnaire was administered to 480 students while 472 were retrieved.

T-test was used to test various hypotheses and research questions. Result indicated that there is {{no significant difference in the}} level of awareness of wildlife laws <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> gender as well as school type. However, there is significant relationship between the level of awareness on wildlife laws <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> perception towards conservation. It was observed that there are few or no extracurricular activities in most secondary schools that can promote awareness in wildlife laws <b>and</b> <b>policies.</b> Subjects like nature studies should be re-introduced into school curriculum and conservation clubs should be established and be made functional in our secondary schools to inculcate awareness of wildlife laws <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> in the younger generation...|$|R

40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} a {{challenging}} public health issue facing communities throughout the U. S. Local efforts {{are believed to}} be essential to assuring environments that support physical activity and healthy food/beverage consumption among children and their families. However, little is known about how broadly and intensively communities are implementing combinations of programs <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> that address childhood nutrition, physical activity, and weight control. The Healthy Communities Study is a nationwide scientific study in diverse communities to identify characteristics of communities and programs that may be associated with childhood obesity. Data collection occurred in 2013 – 2015; data analysis will be completed in 2016. As part of the Healthy Communities Study, researchers designed a measurement system to assess the number and scope of community programs <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> to examine possible associations between calculated “intensity” scores for these programs <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> behavioral and outcome measures related to healthy weight among children. This report describes the protocol used to capture and code instances of community programs <b>and</b> <b>policies,</b> to characterize attributes of community programs <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> related to study hypotheses, and to calculate the intensity of combinations of community programs <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> (i. e., using the attributes of change strategy, duration, and reach) ...|$|R
