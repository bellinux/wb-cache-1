50|$|Aminoglycosides such as <b>Arbekacin</b> inhibit protein {{synthesis}} in susceptible bacteria by irreversibly binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Specifically, <b>Arbekacin</b> binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA {{and a single}} amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with the decoding site {{in the vicinity of}} nucleotide 1400 in the 16S rRNA component of the 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to misreading of mRNA, so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide, leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes.|$|E
50|$|Aminoglycosides such as <b>Arbekacin</b> work by binding to the {{bacterial}} 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of tRNA which consequently, {{leaves the}} bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth.

40|$|We inoculated an {{in vitro}} {{pharmacodynamic}} model simultaneously with clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and an enterocin-producing enterococcus (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin susceptible) at 7 log 10 CFU/ml to examine enterocin effects and antimicrobial activity on staphylococci. The investigated antimicrobial regimens were 100 mg <b>arbekacin</b> every 12 h (q 12 h), 6 mg daptomycin per kg of body weight/day, 600 mg linezolid q 12 h, and 100 mg tigecycline q 24 h alone and in combination (daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline) with <b>arbekacin.</b> Simulations were performed in triplicate; bacterial quantification occurred over 48 h, {{and development of}} resistance was evaluated throughout. When we evaluated the impact of antimicrobial activity against S. aureus alone, daptomycin demonstrated bactericidal activity (≥ 3 log 10 CFU/ml kill), whereas <b>arbekacin,</b> linezolid, and tigecycline displayed bacteriostatic activities (< 3 log 10 CFU/ml kill). In the mixed-pathogen model, early and distinctive stunting of S. aureus growth was noted (1. 5 log CFU/ml difference) {{in the presence of}} enterocin-producing E. faecalis compared to growth controls run individually (P = 0. 02). Most noteworthy was that in the presence of enterocin-producing E. faecalis, bactericidal activity was observed with <b>arbekacin</b> and tigecycline and with the addition of <b>arbekacin</b> to linezolid.

40|$|<b>Arbekacin</b> {{is widely}} used in Japan for the {{treatment}} of patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In this study, we have determined the optimal concentration targets of <b>arbekacin</b> for both efficacy and safety. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed to relate exposure to the drug and clinical cure/improvement or nephrotoxicity. Since we have reported the population pharmacokinetic parameters for <b>arbekacin</b> in the preceding paper (Y. Tanigawara, R. Sato, K. Morita, M. Kaku, N. Aikawa, and K. Shimizu, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 50 : 3754 - 3762, 2006), individual exposure parameters, such as area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), AUC/MIC, Cmax/MIC, and trough concentration (Cmin) were estimated by the Bayesian method. Logistic regression was used to describe the relationship between exposure to the drug and the probability of clinical cure/improvement or nephrotoxicity. For the clinical efficacy analysis, 174 patients confirmed to have an MRSA infection were evaluated. The Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of <b>arbekacin</b> were associated with the probability of clinical cure/improvement during monotherapy. It was shown that the probability of cure/improvement rose when the Cmax of <b>arbekacin</b> was increased, with an odds ratio of 6. 7 for a change in Cmax from 7. 9 to 12. 5 μg/ml (P = 0. 037). For the nephrotoxic risk analysis, 333 patients were included, regardless of whether a pathogen was identified. Logistic regression analysis revealed Cmin and AUC as risk factors of nephrotoxicity (P < 0. 005). The estimated probabilities of arbekacin-induced nephrotoxicity were 2. 5, 5. 2, and 13. 1 % when the Cmin values were 1, 2, and 5 μg/ml, respectively.

40|$|<b>Arbekacin</b> is an {{aminoglycoside}} used in Japan {{for treating}} infections caused by gentamicin and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of <b>arbekacin</b> against 454 clinical isolates of ORSA. The isolates were consecutively collected between January and July, 2000, from patients hospitalized in 8 Brazilian medical centers. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method according to NCCLS recommendations. The vast majority of the isolates, 453 strains (99. 8 %), were considered susceptible to <b>arbekacin</b> based on the criteria proposed by the Requirements for Antibiotic Products of Japan. Only 1 isolate (0. 2 %) was classified as resistant. On the other hand, high rates of resistance were demonstrated for other aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin (97. 6 % resistance) and amikacin (97. 0 % resistance). Resistance rate was also high for ciprofloxacin (98. 0 %). All isolates were considered susceptible to vancomycin. The excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity of <b>arbekacin</b> demonstrated in this study indicates that this antimicrobial agent may play an important role in the treatment of severe ORSA infections, especially those that show poor clinical response with vancomycin monotherapy. Since the aminoglycosides should not be used as monotherapy to treat Gram positive infections, further studies evaluating in vitro and in vivo synergistic activity of <b>arbekacin</b> combinations are necessary to clarify the clinical role of this aminoglycoside.

The age of the study population ranged from 8 to 95 years, and weight ranged from 10. 8 to 107 kg. In total, 1, 581 serum <b>arbekacin</b> concentrations were measured (primarily from routine patient care) and used to perform the present pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug concentration-time data were well described by a two-compartment open model. Factors influencing <b>arbekacin</b> pharmacokinetics were investigated using a nonlinear mixed-effect model analysis. The best-developed model showed that drug clearance (CL) was related to creatinine clearance (CLCR), age, and body weight (WT), as expressed by CL (liter/h) = 0. 0319 CLCR + (26. 5 /age) (CLCR < 80 ml/min) and CL (liter/h) = 0. 0130 CLCR + 0. 0342 WT + (26. 5 /age) (CLCR ≥ 80 ml/min).

The MICs of SM- 17466, meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and <b>arbekacin</b> at which 90 % of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited were 3. 13, 50, 100, 1. 56, and 3. 13 micrograms/ml, respectively. This activity of SM- 17466 was almost equivalent to those of the antibiotics used for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. SM- 17466 also showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In contrast, SM- 17466 was less active against gram-negative bacteria, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with the other carbapenems; however, of the carbapenems, SM- 17466 exhibited the highest activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteriodes fragilis. SM- 17466, at a 50 % inhibitory concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml, bound to penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 4 in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and also had good binding to penicillin-binding protein 2 ' in a methicillin-resistant strain (50 % inhibitory concentration, 5. 9 micrograms/ml). This high affinity, which was 10 and 20 times greater than those for meropenem and imipenem, respectively, was reflected in the potent activity of SM- 17466 against methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

40|$|SummaryButirosin, an {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic {{produced by}} Bacillus circulans, bears the unique (S) - 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side chain, which protects the antibiotic from several common resistance mechanisms.

We, therefore, evaluated the activity of daptomycin alone or in combination in an in vitro infection model against two glycopeptide intermediate-resistant S. aureus (GISA) isolates. Newly designed regimens of daptomycin at 4 and 6 mg/kg of body weight every 24 h (q 24 h) were compared to the previous regimen of 3 mg/kg q 12 h. Daptomycin MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) (MIC/MBC) for Mu- 50, HIP 5836 (992), and MRSA- 67 were 0. 5 / 1. 0, 0. 5 / 1. 0, and 0. 125 / 0. 5 μg/ml, respectively.

Our experience with daptomycin in an in vitro infection model has shown significant kill against the two GISA strains (Mu- 50 and 992) (P < 0. 03). We also noted that kill was related to a total dose effect for 992, in which simulated daptomycin in vivo dosages of 6 mg/kg q 24 h and 3 mg/kg q 12 h produced similar kill and 4 mg/kg q 24 h resulted in significant regrowth (P ≤ 0. 05). Combination therapy with <b>arbekacin</b> resulted in synergistic activity against Mu- 50. Daptomycin area under the concentration-time curve/MIC and Cmax/MIC ranges for GISA isolates were 80 to 116 and 6 to 12, respectively, and ranges for MRSA- 67 were 320 to 461 and 24 to 48, respectively, and appeared to have an association with kill (i. e., decreased CFU/milliliter) at 24 and 48 h.

PCR and subsequent sequencing analysis indicated NK 0009 possessed a novel class 1 integron, designated as In 124, that carries an array of four gene cassettes: a novel aminoglycoside (AG) resistance gene, aac(69) -Iag, blaIMP- 1, a truncated form of blaIMP- 1, and a truncated form of aac(69) -Iag. The aac(69) -Iag encoded a 167 -amino-acid protein that shows 40 % identity with AAC(69) -Iz. Recombinant AAC(69) -Iag protein showed aminoglycoside 69 -N-acetyltransferase activity using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and MS spectrometric analysis. Escherichia coli carrying aac(69) -Iag showed resistance to amikacin, <b>arbekacin,</b> dibekacin, isepamicin, kanamycin, sisomicin, and tobramycin; but not to gentamicin. A conjugation experiment and subsequent Southern hybridization with the gene probes for blaIMP- 1 and aac(69) -Ig strongly suggested In 124 is on a conjugal plasmid. Transconjugants acquired resistance t...|$|E
40|$|Serious infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are {{frequently}} {{treated with the}} combination of a ß-lactam antimicrobial and an aminoglycoside. P. aeruginosa strain PA 0905 was isolated in 2005 from an inpatient in Brazil. It showed a panresistant phenotype that included resistance to ß-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. The ß-lactam resistance was conferred by the production of the metallo-ß-lactamase SPM- 1. No inhibitory zone was observed when a disk diffusion test was performed with the semisynthetic aminoglycoside <b>arbekacin,</b> raising suspicion of 16 S rRNA methylase production. A cloning experiment subsequently revealed the presence of a novel 16 S rRNA methylase, RmtD, which accounted for the high-level resistance to all 4, 6 -disubstituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides, such as amikacin, tobramycin, and gentamicin. RmtD shared a moderate degree of identity with RmtA, another 16 S rRNA methylase that was initially reported to occur in P. aeruginosa in Japan in 2003. This is the first identification of aminoglycoside resistance mediated by a 16 S rRNA methylase in South America. This is also the first report to document coproduction of a metallo-ß-lactamase and a 16 S rRNA methylase, a combination that would severely compromise therapeutic options for the infected patients...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Mycobacterium abscessus is {{innately}} {{resistant to}} a variety of drugs thereby limiting therapeutic options. Bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides (AGs) is conferred mainly by AG-modifying enzymes, which often have overlapping activities. Several putative AG-modifying enzymes are encoded in the genome of M. abscessus. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the molecular basis underlying AG resistance in M. abscessus. Methods M. abscessus deletion mutants deficient in one of three genes potentially involved in AG resistance, aac(2 '), eis 1 and eis 2, were generated by targeted gene inactivation, as were combinatorial double and triple deletion mutants. MICs were determined to study susceptibility {{to a variety}} of AG drugs and to capreomycin. Results Deletion of aac(2 ') increased susceptibility of M. abscessus to kanamycin B, tobramycin, dibekacin and gentamicin C. Deletion of eis 2 increased susceptibility to capreomycin, hygromycin B, amikacin and kanamycin B. Deletion of eis 1 did not affect drug susceptibility. Equally low MICs of apramycin, <b>arbekacin,</b> isepamicin and kanamycin A for WT and mutant strains indicate that these drugs are not inactivated by either AAC(2 ') or Eis enzymes. Conclusions M. abscessus expresses two distinct AG resistance determinants, AAC(2 ') and Eis 2, which confer clinically relevant drug resistance...|$|E
40|$|We {{encountered}} three clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus {{which were}} susceptible to netilmicin and <b>arbekacin</b> {{in the absence}} of β-lactam antibiotics but which were resistant to them in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics. One of these strains, KU 5801, was used to further investigate the antagonism between aminoglycosides and β-lactam antibiotics. β-Lactam antibiotics induced bacterial synthesis of aminoglycoside- 6 ′-N-acetyltransferase and 2 "-O-phosphotransferase [AAC(6 ′) -APH(2 ") ] in association with decreased antimicrobial activities of aminoglycosides. A 14. 4 -kb EcoRI fragment that included the genes that control for β-lactam-inducible aminoglycoside resistance was cloned from a 31 -kb conjugative plasmid present in KU 5801. Restriction fragment mapping and PCR analysis suggested that a Tn 4001 -like element containing a gene encoding AAC(6 ′) -APH(2 ") was located downstream from a truncated blaZ gene. The DNA sequence between blaR 1 and a Tn 4001 -like element was determined. The Tn 4001 -IS 257 hybrid structure was cointegrated into the blaZ gene, and the typical sequences for the termination of transcription were not found between these regions. We deduced that antagonism of aminoglycosides by β-lactam antibiotics in isolate KU 5801 involved transcription of the aac(6 ′) -Ie-aph(2 ") -Ia gene {{under the influence of the}} system regulating penicillinase production...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{isolation}} frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and susceptibility of MRSA to antibiotics, a questionnaire survey was performed every half year from 1993 until 1997. The questionnaire {{was sent to}} medical doctors, and it asked retroactively about the isolation of S. aureus from clinical specimens. The isolation rate of MRSA from patients over 65 years of age was higher, and that from patients under 16 years of age was lower, than the rates in other age groups (P < 0. 01). Ratios of isolation of MRSA among S. aureus strains were from 12 to 38 % in the clinics, from 39 to 71 % in the small-scale hospitals and from 47 to 62 % in large-sized hospitals. These isolation rates increased gradually from 1993 to 1997 (P < 0. 001). The isolation rate of MRSA from the sputum was higher, and those from pus, pharyngeal secretion and urine were lower, than those from feces and other specimens and from total specimens. The isolation rate of antibiotic-resistant strains of MRSA was highest for penicillins and cepharosporins. MRSA was highly susceptible to <b>arbekacin</b> (isolation rate of resistant strains: 3. 0 %) and vancomycin (3. 0 %), and was slightly susceptible to mino-cycline (21 %), doxycycline (24 %), amikacin (39 %) and dibekacin (37 %).

40|$|Antagonism of aminoglycosides by {{divalent}} cations is {{well documented}} for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is {{regarded as one of}} the problems in aminoglycoside therapy. It is generally considered that divalent cations interfere with uptake of aminoglycosides at both the outer and inner membranes. It has been demonstrated recently that aminoglycosides can be removed from cells of P. aeruginosa by the three-component multidrug resistance efflux pump MexXY-OprM. We sought to investigate the interplay between efflux and uptake in resistance to aminoglycosides in P. aeruginosa. To do so, we studied the effects of the divalent cations Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + on susceptibility to aminoglycosides in a wild-type strain of P. aeruginosa and in mutants either overexpressing or lacking the MexXY-OprM efflux pump. MICs of gentamicin, streptomycin, amikacin, apramycin, netilmicin, and <b>arbekacin</b> were determined in Mueller-Hinton broth in the presence of cations added at concentrations that varied from 0. 125 to 8 mM. We found, unexpectedly, that while both Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + antagonized aminoglycosides (up to a 64 -fold decrease in susceptibility at 8 mM), antagonism was seen only in the strains of P. aeruginosa that contained the functional MexXY-OprM efflux pump. Our results indicate that inhibition of the MexXY-OprM efflux pump should abolish the antagonism of aminoglycosides by divalent cations, regardless of its precise mechanism. This may significantly increase the therapeutic index of aminoglycosides and improve the clinical utility of this important class of antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There {{are limited}} choice of {{antimicrobial}} agents to treat infection with metallo- β -lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We evaluate the antimicrobial effects of aztreonam alone, colistin alone and the 3 -drug combination of aztreonam, ceftazidime and amikacin on 23 strains of metallo- β -lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa by time-killing tests. Methods Strains used were from different hospitals in Japan and had different pulse-field gel electrophoresis patterns by restriction with Spe I. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 11 antimicrobial agents (piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, aztreonam, ceftazidime, amikacin, tobramycin, <b>arbekacin,</b> ciprofloxacin and colistin) were determined using the agar dilution test. The effects of aztreonam, colistin {{and the combination}} of aztreonam, ceftazidime and amikacin were determined by time-killing studies. Results Bacteriostatic effects after 6 hours of drug exposure were observed in 12 strains (52. 2 %) of 23 strains of metallo- β -lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa with 48 mg/l aztreonam, in 19 strains (82. 6 %) with the 3 -drug combination of 16 mg/l aztreonam, 16 mg/l ceftazidime, and 4 mg/l amikacin, and in 23 strains (100 %) with 2 mg/l colistin. Bactericidal effects after 6 h drug exposure were observed in 1 strain (4. 3 %) with 48 mg/l aztreonam, in 8 strains (30. 4 %) with the 3 -drug combination and in all 23 strains (100 %) with 2 mg/l colistin. Conclusion Evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial effects on metallo- β -lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa revealed relatively good effects of the 3 -drug combination of aztreonam, ceftazidime and amikacin and marked effects of colistin. </p...|$|E
