40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that the {{momentum}} distribution of a metallic state of fermionic atoms in a lattice Fermi-Bose mixture exhibits coherent oscillations after a global quench that suppresses tunneling. The oscillation period is determined by the Fermi-Bose interaction strength. Here we show that similar coherent dynamics, but with a different functional form, occurs in the fermionic Hubbard model when we quench a noninteracting metallic state by introducing a Hubbard interaction and suppressing tunneling. The period is determined primarily by the interaction strength. Conversely, we show that one can accurately determine the Hubbard interaction strength from the oscillation period, taking into <b>account</b> <b>corrections</b> from any small residual tunneling present in the final Hamiltonian.
