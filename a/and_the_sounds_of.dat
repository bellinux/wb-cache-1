5|$|Boone informs Locke he {{is tired}} of lying, and wants to tell Shannon about the hatch. Locke knocks him {{unconscious}} with the handle of his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in {{the ground in front}} of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, he {{published}} an album featuring Jad Fair and the French noise artist Philippe Petit. He also started a two piece band called Bismuth with multi-instrumentalist Arnold van de Velde. In {{the same year}} he started his Strat Eraser Project and built a series of instruments for direct sale, along with the workshop exclusive models. In November he gave a TEDx talk. Around this time, he began to depart from building stringed instruments. Inspired by the percussive works of Lou Harrison, John Cage, and the Belgian sound artist George Smits, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian Gamelan instruments, he created a collection of metal percussion instruments and amplified them with guitar pickups. These instruments are widely used on the recordings of Bismuth and in his live performances. Also, he built a set of motor instruments and invented an instrument made from soda pop PET bottles.|$|E

Themes reminiscent of Scarpia, Tosca and Cavaradossi emerge in the music, which changes tone as the drama resumes with Cavaradossi's entrance, to an orchestral statement of what becomes the melody of his aria [...] "E lucevan le stelle".|$|E

Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Taliban were still active in the area. Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted. Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> mortar shells could be heard: [...] "People are again scared that the peace may not last for long. Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{make use}} of vintage analog {{electronic}} instruments such as the Farfisa and Vox organs, and the Moog synthesizer, which was featured prominently on 1994's Mars Audiac Quintet. Gane has praised these older instruments for their superior controllability: [...] "We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things." [...] Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were inspirations, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich {{can be found on}} 1999's Cobra and Phases Group.... Several critics have commented that the band's later work, like Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), sound similar to their guitar-driven earlier style.|$|E
500|$|All {{television}} match players wore small microphones so {{that their}} words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> play could be heard by the audience. After Bell's second 9 ball break, Balukas reportedly muttered {{within the range of}} the microphone words to the effect that Bell was having a string of inordinately lucky shots. She was cautioned by the referee and play continued, with Balukas the ultimate victor with a final score of 9–5. According to an interview with Balukas appearing in New York Woman magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were [...] "Some world championship... beat me with skill, not luck." [...] Despite their off-the-table friendship, following the match Bell made a formal complaint to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors thereafter sanctioned Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct.|$|E

500|$|The album {{contains}} twelve tracks; {{it opens}} with [...] "Make Me Know It". The second track is {{a cover of}} [...] "Fever", which Presley based on Peggy Lee's version, although his recording incorporates finger-snapping <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the two percussionists are divided between the two channels of the stereo mix. On [...] "The Girl of My Best Friend", Presley is supported with doo-wop backing vocals by The Jordanaires. The fourth track is [...] "I Will Be Home Again", a slow ballad performed as a duet with Charlie Hodge. The fifth track is [...] "Dirty, Dirty Feeling", a song characterized by its [...] "raunchy rock sound" [...] and satirical humor; {{it was written by}} Leiber and Stoller, and had been previously discarded from the soundtrack of King Creole. [...] The final track on side one is [...] "Thrill of Your Love", on which Presley is accompanied by Cramer on the piano.|$|E
500|$|Stetson's {{parts on}} Vol. 3 were {{performed}} and recorded live without overdubs or loops in various studios in Montreal, {{where he had}} wanted to use the large rooms to provide more reverb. Using an arrangement of microphones placed in strategic places including {{on the side of the}} saxophone, on his own throat, hanging from the ceiling and at different points around the studio, Stetson captured not only the sounds of the instrument but also the percussive sound of the keys <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> his own breathing and vocalizing through the horn. [...] Producer Ben Frost, whom Stetson had previously worked with on New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges, mixed between fifteen and twenty recordings of the same performance into a cohesive piece of music at Greenhouse Studios in Iceland. The vocals of Justin Vernon were recorded at April Base studios in Fall Creek, Wisconsin, and were overdubbed later in the recording process.|$|E
500|$|The {{recorded}} {{version of}} the song begins with sound of ambient music and the stereo sound oscillating, which continues for 40 seconds. The music is interspersed by small trip hop and psychedelic sounds, both at the foreground and background. As McKuen's sample utters the words [...] "you see", Madonna starts uttering the first lyrics, [...] "I traded fame for love / Without a second thought", and at around the 1:30 minute mark, the drums start with the first chorus. The composition starts building slowly, alongside Madonna's vocals with a Jimi Hendrix-like guitar sound complimenting the music. An acoustic guitar comes into prominence from 2:49 minute mark, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> piano {{can be heard in}} the distance. Arpeggios consisting of electric guitar are added in the mix, and ultimately the drum sounds become heavy. Orbit adds more guitars and increases the volume with the electronic sounds becoming turbulent. Madonna's singing gathers momentum and intensity, belting the line [...] "No one night stand, no far off land / No fire that I can spark", when it suddenly subsides, ebbing away.|$|E

500|$|Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon {{expected}} to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence {{was similar to}} a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers [...] "the heart of the experience" [...] and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the [...] "whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality {{of dealing with the}} crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.|$|E

2500|$|Innis {{points out}} that the tablets were not well suited to pictographic writing because making {{straight}} lines [...] "tended to pull up the clay." [...] Therefore Sumerian scribes used a cylindrical reed stylus to stamp or press wedges and lines on the moist tablet. Scribes gradually developed cuneiform signs to represent syllables <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the spoken language. Innis writes that as a heavy material, clay was not very portable and so was not generally suited for communication over large areas. Cuneiform inscription required years of training overseen by priests. Innis contends therefore, that as a writing medium, clay tended to favour decentralization and religious control.|$|E
