50|$|A {{jump seat}} (or jumpseat), in {{aviation}} {{refers to an}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seat</b> for individuals—other than normal passengers—who are not operating the aircraft. In general, the term 'jump seat' can also refer to a seat in any type of vehicle which can fold {{up out of the}} way; vehicles include carriages, automobiles, vans, buses, fire tenders, and taxicabs. The term originated in the United States c. 1860 for a movable carriage seat.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1958, after {{sluggish}} {{sales and}} {{to take advantage of}} economies of scale, the range was whittled down to a single model. A fifteen percent sales tax on passenger cars had recently been introduced, making the SS a hard sell, and the pickup's limited payload and sales conspired against it. The [...] "SL" [...] Light Van remained; its owner could also easily install a proper rear seat to circumvent the taxation rule. With two seats plus an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seat,</b> a 200 kg payload, and a standard two-tone paintjob, it was also referred to as the [...] "Suzulight SF Light Van" [...] in period brochures. Although looking a lot like a modern hatchback in design, this was considerably more utilitarian in nature. Production ended in July 1959 with the introduction of the Suzulight TL Light Van. Production of the commercial use Suzulight SF series were 101 in 1956, followed by 385 examples in 1957, 454 in 1958. 1,115 Suzukis intended for commercial use were built in 1959, but the lion's share of that year's production consisted of the succeeding TL series.|$|E

50|$|Early touring cars {{featured}} folding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seats</b> {{to offer}} additional passenger capacity. Some early automobiles were available with an exterior rumble seat that folded open into an upholstered seat {{for one or}} two passengers.|$|R
50|$|The Kingsway name {{continued}} for the 1941 model year, on model D20. It was {{now available in}} two versions, base and Special. The Special was about $25 more than the base model. Body styles offered {{were the same as}} in 1940 {{with the addition of a}} 5-passenger coupe with fold-up (<b>auxiliary)</b> <b>seats</b> in the rear compartment.|$|R
50|$|A {{card table}} {{is usually a}} square table with legs that fold up individually, with one leg lining each edge. Card tables are {{traditionally}} used for playing card games, board games, and other tabletop games. Due to their low cost and small storage size, in the United States they are frequently found in college apartments, or as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seating</b> for family meals such as Thanksgiving. Many folding card tables are used for specialist games such as contract bridge or poker, {{as a result there}} are some folding tables with fabric surfaces such as felt.|$|R
50|$|Rather than build {{completely}} new, though, the new stadium, {{which was}} also called Memorial Stadium for its first four seasons, was considered an expansion and relocation of the old stadium as all of Memorial Stadium's main seating areas were dismantled in 1969 {{and moved to the}} new site further down Summit Street where they were reassembled in a new configuration. The original south grandstand was moved to be the north end zone seats at the new stadium, while the north grandstand became the south end zone. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seating</b> sections that had been adjacent to the grandstands at Memorial Stadium were placed along the east sideline of the new stadium.|$|R
5000|$|Mason Arena: Seating for 3,200 (with <b>auxiliary</b> gym that <b>seats</b> 1,000), center-court scoreboard, 4 corner scoreboards. Hosts state playoff games.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 {{a modest}} frontal {{revision}} placed {{more emphasis on}} horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. Standard equipment included automatic level control; carpeted foot rests; fixed ratio power steering; remote control right-hand side outside rearview mirror; rear window defogger and automatic climate control. The sedan included folding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seats.</b> The limousine had the doors cut into the roof and had the traditional partition and glass divider. Trim included bright body underscores with rear extensions; horizontal thin belt moldings; Fleetwood front fender lettering and laurel wreath badges for the hood and deck lid. Several optional rear roof treatments were available making these models true factory-built semi-custom-type vehicles.|$|R
50|$|In 1957 a tubular X-frame without {{side rails}} was adopted. This {{resulted}} in greater structural rigidity and provided for a lower body without {{a loss of}} usable space. Front end styling was marked by rubber bumper guard tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the Series 75 were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal windsplits. At the upper end this fenderbreak trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both tailamps. The Series 75 came as a limousine or in a nine-passenger sedan configuration, both with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seats.</b> Power was 300 to 325 hp (224 to 242 kW) for 1957.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 the grille was {{redesigned}} with wider {{spaces between}} the blades and the parking lamps were repositioned beneath directly below the headlights. The trim of the Series 75 long wheelbase model was distinctive from other lines. A horizontal rub molding ran from the front parking light housings to {{the trailing edge of}} the front door and stopped. A full length vertical air slot-style fenderbreak molding was placed directly behind the rear gap of the back doors. The two moldings did not meet at right angles. A Fleetwood script appeared on the rear deck lid. The high headroom appearance was seen again. Both the sedan and the limousine continued to feature <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seats</b> for extra passenger carrying capacity and the Imperial limousine had a hydraulically operated glass driver's partition. Engine output was increased to 250 hp (186 kW). An optional dual-four barrel carb setup boasted 270 hp (201 kW). Hydramatic automatic transmission was now standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 {{there was}} a new grille, with finer {{textured}} insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. Side trim was about the same as in 1955, except for the addition of exhaust extension moldings on the rear fender. The trim ran long a tapering conical flare from above the wheel housing to the rear bumper. A Fleetwood script appeared on the deck lid and limousine styling was seen again. Both the sedan and the limousine had <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seats</b> and the Imperial limousine again featured a glass driver's partition. Standard equipment was comparable to the previous year. The engine was stroked to 365 cuin L for 285 or 305 hp (213 or 227 kW) in 1956.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} model was a standard 85 ft long and weighed 109000 lb. The increased weight {{came from the}} stressed skin steel construction (instead of plywood), and the standard <b>auxiliary</b> equipment. Interior <b>seating</b> capacity ranged from 56-68. The distinctive oval or oblong windows were designed to reduce stress concentrations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hatchback}} {{with its}} lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat accounted {{for nearly half}} of all Vegas sold. The sedan, later named [...] "Notchback" [...] is the only Vega model with an enclosed trunk, and had the lowest base price.The Kammback wagon has a lower cargo liftover height and a swing-up liftgate. The panel express panel delivery model has steel panels in place of the wagon's rear side glass, an enclosed storage area under the load floor, and a low-back driver's <b>seat.</b> An <b>auxiliary</b> passenger <b>seat</b> was optional.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{shows the}} {{development}} of the design and manufacturing of a very small engine, namely its head. The engine works under the 4 -stroke cycle, therefore having a very complex cylinder head, housing the camshaft, valves and its <b>auxiliaries</b> (<b>seats,</b> guides, springs), spark plug, inlet and exhaust passages and a coolant chamber. The geometries, both inner and outer are highly intricate which makes the production of such a part a very difficult job. In addition, when the engine is very small, as it is the case of this engine, all dimensions are miniaturized therefore making it extremely difficult to design, cast and finish. The cooling chamber, in particular, has a critical inner core removal problem due to reduced accessibility, imposing casting limitations. The cores place also a problem of air and gas removal during metal filling and solidification. Rapid prototyping may be the only solution to build the cores, and may help in the design and manufacturing phases of the casting tools. 3 D printing with a plaster based material as a rapid prototyping technique presents itself as a tool to drastically reduce the design-development-casting process effort and time cycle.

50|$|In 1937 {{bodies were}} the same except for drip moldings running {{from the bottom of}} the front pillar up and over the doors and rear quarter window, new fenders and bumpers, {{headlights}} rigidly attached (adjusted by moving reflector), wheel discs incorporated a hubcap, and a built-in trunk was incorporated on most bodies. A die-cast eggcrate grille was used, but the hood louver treatment differed from that used in Fisher bodied cars. Chrome die cast strips were used at the rear of the hood side panels. A seven-passenger Fisher-bodied Special touring sedan, without a division window was offered on the 138.0 in wheelbase. These two body styles had the eggcrate hood louvers typical of all Fisher bodied Cadillacs for 1937. The Business car line included eight-passenger versions of these Special sedans plus eight-passenger versions of Fleetwood body styles. The eighth passenger was seated with two others on <b>auxiliary</b> <b>seats.</b> A commercial chassis on a 156.0 in wheelbase was offered. Engine changes included a lighter flywheel, a generator relocated in the vee, an oil filter, a new carburetor with full automatic electric choke, an oil bath cleaner, and a relocated distributor. A new transmission design featured pin-type synchronizers, shifter rails relocated to the side of the case, a cover on the bottom of the case, and an extension integral with the transmission mainshaft. Sales totaled 4,332.|$|R
5000|$|No single {{automotive}} design better {{characterizes the}} industry's late 1950s flamboyance than the 1959 Cadillac, which incorporated totally new styling. Large tailfin, twin bullet taillamps, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck-lid beauty panels personified these cars. The long-wheelbase Series 75 technically became the Series 6700, {{in keeping with}} Cadillac's new series scheme, but in practice was still {{referred to as the}} [...] "Series 75." [...] Production models again were a nine-passenger sedan and Imperial limousine with <b>auxiliary</b> jump <b>seats.</b> The [...] "Imperial" [...] term was no longer used soon after Chrysler introduced their top-level luxury sedans and limousines with the Imperial in 1955.|$|R

5000|$|Note: Tan Chee Kien {{was offered}} an <b>auxiliary</b> NCMP <b>seat</b> [...] after Madai Puthan Damodaran Nair, a Workers' Party {{candidate}} in Jalan Kayu SMC had declined the offered NCMP seat despite garnered 48.78% of the votes, {{but he had}} declined as well. This election is the first election to implement NCMP scheme, and also the only election where the opposition had declined the NCMP seat. Til date, NCMP scheme {{is one of the}} scheme that the opposition had crtizied of because a NCMP does not get the majority support from a particular constituency and various restrictions were imposed on them. This means Tan had the second highest share of the opposition votes, but failed to win the seat.|$|R
50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs {{exhibited}} smoother styling, {{more subtle}} {{rendition of the}} styling theme introduced one year earlier. General changes included a full-width grille; the elimination of pointed front bumper guards; increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim; lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles which encased stacked taillights and back up lamps and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. The long wheelbase sedan and limousine had <b>auxiliary</b> jump <b>seats,</b> high-headroom formal six-window styling, broad ribbed edge beauty panels and trim generally similar to Series 6200 Cadillacs in other respects. The limousine passenger compartment was trimmed in either bradford cloth or Bedford cloth, both in combinations with wool. Florentine leather upholstery was used in the chauffeur's compartment. Standard equipment was essentially the same as the previous year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{drive to}} build a {{permanent}} stadium was organized in 1946, led by a committee made up of students, alumni, faculty, and local residents who raised approximately $60,000 in two years. Long-range plans initially called for permanent seating to form a horseshoe around the field and seating for 30,000 people. The first game held at the new stadium was on October 14, 1950, a 57-0 win over Marietta College. That was also the stadium's dedication game, where it was dedicated to the 113 KSU students who had died during World War II. The main grandstand sat 5,600 people and included a press box. <b>Auxiliary</b> bleacher <b>seating</b> {{was placed on the}} opposite side of the field for an initial capacity of approximately 7,000.|$|R
25|$|The {{hatchback}} coupe {{features a}} lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat. The notchback sedan {{had the lowest}} price {{and is the only}} Vega model with an enclosed trunk. The Safari wagon has fixed rear-side glass and a swing-up liftgate. A panel delivery based on the wagon was sold through the 1975 model year. It has steel panels in place of the rear-side glass, and an additional enclosed storage area. An <b>auxiliary</b> front passenger <b>seat</b> was optional.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} {{refinements}} {{were introduced in}} 1981, including an automatic transmission, air conditioning, an auxiliary fuel tank, protective headlamp grilles and a cable winch. Fuel injection became available in 1982, when the 230 GE was introduced in Turin, along with more comfortable and supportive front <b>seats,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> heating, wider tires and fender flares. For 1985, differential locks, central door locking and a tachometer became standard and by 1986 over 50,000 G Models had been produced.|$|R
50|$|SEL (2011-2012) and Titanium (2013): The SEL (2011 and 2012 models), or Titanium (2013 models only), was the top-of-the-line {{trim level}} of the Ford Fiesta between 2011 and 2013. It added the {{following}} equipment to the mid-level SE: Ford SYNC with USB and <b>auxiliary</b> inputs, leather-trimmed <b>seating</b> surfaces, a power front driver's seat, heated front seats, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, and security system. Available as either a Hatchback or as a Sedan, the Ford Fiesta SEL and Titanium offered no additional options or packages as the top-of-the-line Ford Fiesta model.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1973 {{the first}} Alfasud sport model joined the range, the two-door Alfasud ti—(Turismo Internazionale, or Touring International). Along with a 5-speed gearbox, it {{featured}} {{a more powerful}} version of the 1.2 litre engine, brought to [...] by adopting a Weber twin-choke carburettor, allowing the small saloon to reach 160 km/h. Quad round halogen headlamps, special wheels, a front body-colour spoiler beneath the bumper and rear black one around the tail distinguished the [...] "ti", while inside there was a three-spoke steering wheel, <b>auxiliary</b> gauges, leatherette/cloth <b>seats,</b> and carpets in place of rubber mats.|$|R
50|$|SES (2011 USA): The SES (2011) for the North America {{market was}} the top-of-the-line trim {{level of the}} Ford Fiesta during the year 2011. It added the {{following}} equipment to the mid-level SE: Ford SYNC with 1x USB port, and 1x <b>auxiliary</b> input, leather <b>seats</b> with leather piping, a manually adjustable front driver and passenger seat, heated front seats, sixteen-inch alloy wheels, and touch-button security system with a push-button start using a key-fob. Only available as a Hatchback, the Ford Fiesta SES offered additional options or packages such as Winter Driving Package with heated mirrors and a single-color LCD head unit as the top-of-the-line Ford Fiesta model at the time.|$|R
40|$|The paper completes {{ascertainment}} of electrical-supply scheme {{reliability for}} the auxiliaries {{of a nuclear}} power plant. Thereat the author considers the system behavior during the block normal operation, carrying out current maintenance, and capital repairs in combination with initiating events. The initiating events for reactors include complete blackout, i. e. the loss of outside power supply (normal and reserve); emergency switching one of the working turbogenerators; momentary dumping the normal rating {{to the level of}} <b>auxiliaries</b> with <b>seating</b> the cutout valve of one turbo-generator. The combination of any initiating event with the repairing mode in case of one of the system elements failure should not lead to blackout occurrence of more than one system of the reliable power supply. This requirement rests content {{with the help of the}} reliable power supply system self-dependence (electrical and functional) and the emergency power-supply operational autonomy (diesel generator and accumulator batteries). The reliability indicators of the power supply system for the nuclear power plant auxiliaries are the conditional probabilities of conjoined blackout of one, two, and three sections of the reliable power supply conditional upon an initiating event emerging and the blackout of one, two, and three reliable power-supply sections under the normal operational mode. Furthermore, they also are the blackout periodicity of one and conjointly two, three, and four sections of normal operation under the block normal operational mode. It is established that the blackout of one bus section of normal operation and one section of reliable power-supply system of the auxiliaries that does not lead to complete blackout of the plant auxiliaries may occur once in three years. The probability of simultaneous power failure of two or three normal-operation sections and of two reliable power-supply sections during the power plant service life is unlikely. </p...|$|R
