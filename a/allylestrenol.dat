Along with propyltestosterone, it has been patented as a topical antiandrogen and hair growth inhibitor. Allyltestosterone is the parent structure of two medically used 19-nortestosterone progestins, <b>allylestrenol</b> and altrenogest.

50|$|According to its {{manufacturer}} Roussel Uclaf, altrenogest has weak anabolic and {{androgenic activity}} equivalent to 1/20th of that of testosterone. However, no significant androgenic effects {{have been observed}} in young stallions or mature mares, and altrenogest has notably been used to maintain pregnancy in mares (similarly {{to the use of}} <b>allylestrenol</b> to maintain pregnancy in women) with no incidence of virilization or other abnormalities in filly offspring. On the other hand, minor potential anabolic/androgenic effects have been suggested for altrenogest in pigs.|$|E

50|$|Altrenogest is an estrane (C18) steroid and 19-nortestosterone {{derivative}} known chemically as 17α-allyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone or 17α-allylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one. It {{is one of}} {{only two}} marketed progestins that possesses a 17α-allyl group, the other being <b>allylestrenol.</b> Most other progestins possess a 17α-ethynyl group, while AAS, if they are 17α-substituted, are usually 17α-alkylated (with a methyl or ethyl group). Altrenogest is the 17α-allylated derivative of the AAS trenbolone (and hence can also be referred to as allyltrenbolone or allyltrienolone), which itself is the 9,11-didehydro analogue of the AAS nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, <b>allylestrenol,</b> and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Extension of the C17α alkyl chain {{longer than}} an ethyl group abolishes {{androgenic}} activity and converts the drug into an antiandrogen, as in topterone (17α-propyltestosterone) and <b>allylestrenol</b> (17α-allyl-3-deketo-19-nortestosterone) (an extended-chain variant of ethylestrenol). Conversely, {{replacement of the}} C17α alkyl group with an ethynyl group greatly reduces but does not abolish androgenic activity, as in ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). Similarly to extension of the C17α alkyl chain, extension of the C17α ethynyl chain abolishes androgenic activity, as with dimethisterone (6α,21-dimethylethisterone). Dienogest, which is antiandrogenic, features extension of the C17α chain {{in the form of}} a cyanomethyl group at the C17α position.|$|E
50|$|Flumedroxone acetate {{is said to}} have weak or slight progestogenic {{activity}} without other hormonal activity (including estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, anabolic, or glucocorticoid). It has been assessed in over 1,000 patients for the treatment of migraine, with effectiveness ranging from excellent to less than that of the reference antimigraine drug methysergide. In keeping with its {{progestogenic activity}}, flumedroxone acetate produces menstrual irregularities, namely polymenorrhea, and breast tension as side effects in women.

We present a double-blind randomized controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of terazosin, finasteride and <b>allylestrenol,</b> the prototype drugs in each of these respective categories. A total of 140 patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were inducted into the trial after an informed consent. They were randomized into 4 groups, which received placebo, terazosin, finasteride and <b>allylestrenol</b> respectively for 6 months. Since 29 patients did not complete 6 months of therapy, there were 111 evaluable patients {{at the end of the}} study. We found that these 3 drugs produce comparable improvement in symp-tom score (- 40 %), flow rates (- 60 %) and PVR (- 50 %) which is significantly better than that in the placebo group. Both <b>allylestrenol</b> and finasteride bring about a comparable reduction in prostate volume (- 23 %), which is statistically significant as compared to the placebo and terazosin groups. Terazosin in doses of I and 2 mg/ day was, found to be effiective and well-tolerated in the vast majority of our cases. No adverse effects were seen in the placebo and finasteride groups, while 9. 6 % in the terazosin group had postural hypotension and 10. 7 % in the <b>allylestrenol</b> group had some loss of libido, prob-lems which were reversible upon cessation of therapy...|$|E

40|$|Various non-surgical {{therapeutic}} modalities such as balloon dilation of the prostatic urethra, hyperthermia of {{the prostate}} and medication with antiandrogens and/or adrenergic blockade have been attempted for the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) especially in an early stage or in a poor operative risk. The observation that androgen deprivation induces shrinkage of the hyperplastic prostate represents {{the basis for the}} treatment of BPH with antiandrogen. Although several antiandrogens are now in clinical use in our country, there still remain problems to be solved. We reviewed the mechanism of action and the clinical results of antiandrogens in the treatment of BPH. The improvement following antiandrogen therapy occurred among the patients with symptomatic BPH, in 50 - 80 % subjectively and in 40 - 50 % objectively. The therapy appeared to be more effective in an early stage of the disease. However, the limitation of the duration of the effects and unfavorable side effects should also be noticed. The progestational agents such as gestonorone caproate, chlormadinone acetate and <b>allylestrenol</b> suppress more or less sexual function by interference of the pituitary-gonadal axis.

Both drugs were administered orally for 12 - 16 weeks in a daily dose of 50 mg. With both drugs marked improvement of disorders of micturition and a slight decrease {{in the size of}} the hypertrophied prostatic node were observed. No significant difference was observed between the two drugs in the overall efficacy of the treatments. Significant improvement of practically all parameters used for evaluation of results was observed with both drugs following treatment. Ultrasonotomographic examination revealed diminution of the size of the prostatic node and x-ray examination of the ureter showed improvement in elevation of the fundus of the bladder. These improvements were better after CMA treatment than after AE treatment. With all other parameters used no significant difference was observed between the two drugs. Mild adverse effects such as loss of sexual desire and potency were observed in a few cases. The incidence of side-effects was lower following AE treatment, and the incidence of loss of sexual desire and potency was significantly lower after AE than after CMA.

For the objective evaluation of the sexual function, nocturnal penil tumescence (NPT) was measured using an erectometer. For the subjective evaluation the conventional interview method was employed. The levels of hormones relating to sexual function were also determined. A decrease in NPT was noted in both the ALE and CMA groups, but the degree of the decrease was significantly smaller in the ALE group than in the CMA group (p less than 0. 001). The results of the interview, revealed a large between the two drug groups; in the CMA group, marked worsening for all items. In the determination of hormones, levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone and estradiol were decreased in both drug groups, while the prolactin level was increased in both groups. The changes in the testosterone, estradiol and prolactin levels in the CMA group were significantly dominant compared with those in the ALE group. In addition, drop-out cases due to a decrease in the sexual function numbered 7 (12. 1 %) in the CMA group, while there were no such drop-out cases in the ALE group; the difference in the drop-out rate was thus significant.

Each test drug was orally administered to 58 patients, in a daily dosage of 50 mg for 12 consecutive weeks. The questionnaires consisted of 6 categories each consisting of 5 questions, or 30 questions in total. The 6 categories were "sexual desire," "erectile capacity" and "ejaculation," which relate to the sexual function, and "living environment (including the frequency of sex)," "dysuria" and "dummy (personality). " Each question was graded into 0 - 10 points, and each patient was requested to circle the number which best described his status. The scores were compiled and statistically analyzed. Many patients were senile. Evaluable answers were obtained for 99 (85. 3 %) of the 116 patients. Factor analysis based on the preadministration scores confirmed {{the contents of the}} questionnaires to be appropriate for the objectives of the present study. Multiple regression analysis revealed a high correlation between the self-assessment scores and objective data (nocturnal penile tumescence values; NPT values) when dropout cases due to a decrease in the sexual function and non-replying cases were excluded. The self-assessment questionnaire method was concluded to be as useful an objective test method as the NPT measurement for examining the sexual function. Aggravation of the "frequency of urination during night" was conspicuous in the CMA group, and {{there was a significant difference}} (p less than 0. 05) in this parameter between the two groups.
