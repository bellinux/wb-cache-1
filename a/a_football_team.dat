5|$|By August, the {{prospect}} of Alabama fielding <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> for the 1943 season was in doubt. On August 17, coach Thomas spoke to a civic group in Birmingham and stated {{he did not think}} the school would field a team in 1943 due to the unwillingness of the Army to change their policy that prohibited their cadets from participating in intercollegiate athletics. On August 23, 1943, the University Physical Education and Athletics Committee officially canceled the 1943 season. The decision was made at that time because only two Alabama players were available to compete on the squad. As the season was canceled, coach Thomas spent his time leading war bond drives and serving as president of the Tuscaloosa Exchange Club during the time the season was originally scheduled. The cancellation marked only the third time since 1892 that Alabama did not field <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team.</b> The only other seasons the Crimson Tide did not field teams were in 1898 due to University policy that prohibited athletic teams from traveling off campus to compete and again in 1918 due to the effects of World War I.|$|E
5|$|East Stirlingshire Football Club is a Scottish {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} town of Falkirk. The club was founded in 1881 and competes in the Lowland Football League, in the fifth tier of the Scottish football league system. The club's origins can be traced to 1880 when a local cricket club formed <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> under the name Britannia, based in the village of Bainsford.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Maryland Agricultural, a land-grant {{school with}} a {{military}} curriculum requirement, had a new commandant of cadets take office. Lieutenant Clough Overton, who opposed football at the university, cut funding for equipment and instituted strict rules limiting practice time. Instead of accepting this serious disadvantage against their opponents, the players declined to field <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> for the season.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Ohio State's dental school in 1945, Horvath signed {{to play for}} the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League. Horvath, however, applied for a {{commission}} to join the U.S. Navy and was sworn in as a lieutenant j.g. that August. He was sent at first to Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois for training, where he practiced dentistry and acted as an assistant to Brown, who had entered the Navy and was coaching the base's football team. Horvath served in Hawaii and coached <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> there that won a service national championship. He later traveled on assignment as far as China as a naval dental officer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team.</b> Sometimes, the boys would hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Academy's {{first ever}} {{football}} team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by {{its members and}} their fellow students. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, at most likely an unused drill field on the Naval Academy campus. Navy would not field <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> in 1880 or 1881, likely {{due to the lack of}} support. When football returned to the academy in 1882, the squad was led by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and won 8–0 in a match with Johns Hopkins, starting the seven-year rivalry between the schools.|$|E

5|$|The Naval Academy's {{first ever}} {{football}} team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials.

The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie.

5|$|The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company formed <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team,</b> New Brighton Tower F.C., {{and applied}} for {{membership}} to the Lancashire League. The team {{joined at the}} start of the 1897–98 season and promptly won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted. They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they were hoping for and so it was no longer considered financially viable.|$|E
5|$|The university's {{colors are}} garnet and gold. The colors of garnet and gold {{represent}} a merging of the university's past. While the school fielded <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> as early, or earlier than 1899, in 1902, 1903 and 1905 the team won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms. The following year, the college student body selected crimson {{as the official}} school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet. After World War II the garnet and gold colors were first worn by a renewed football team in a 14–6 loss to Stetson University on October 18, 1947. Florida State University's marching band is the Marching Chiefs.|$|E

5|$|According to Ellsworth P. Bertholf's biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. The Naval Academy's first ever football team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by its members and their fellow students. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, apparently on the Academy superintendent's cow pasture. Navy would not field <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> in 1880 or 1881, {{due to the lack of}} support from officials. When football returned to the academy in 1882, the squad was led by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and won 8–0 in a match with Johns Hopkins, starting a seven-year rivalry between the schools. The 1883 season resulted in Navy's first ever loss, a 2–0 defeat by Johns Hopkins. Navy returned the favor the following year, defeating Hopkins in a close 9–6 game.|$|E
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey {{remained}} in the army during the 1945–46 season, the first campaign following the war. Starting as a centre-forward, he scored two goals in each of Southampton's opening two games, then a hat-trick in a 6–2 victory at Newport County on 6 October 1945. He played in 13 League South matches before military commitments again intervened—in December 1945 he was deployed to Mandatory Palestine, where he accepted an invitation to captain <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>team</b> representing the British garrison. This side included Arthur Rowley, who later scored hundreds of goals for Leicester City and Shrewsbury Town, and the future Scotland international forward Jimmy Mason. Ramsey returned to England in June 1946 to find himself entertaining overtures from both the new Southampton manager Bill Dodgin and the Dagenham Co-op, the latter of which offered Ramsey his pre-war job back. Ramsey initially turned Southampton down, but accepted after the club offered better terms: £6 per week during the summer, £7 in winter and £8 if he was selected for the League team. He was formally discharged from the army soon after.|$|E
