In general, both the police officers and municipal road authorities were more familiar with both legislations than the driving-school owners and driving instructors. A majority of the municipal road authorities believed that the consequences of the introduction would cause a work load increase. However, the opinions of police officers with respect to the consequences of the introduction for work load seemed to be divided. The results of the study should be considered as both a global and a limited inventory of the three target groups' opinions about the introduction of both legislations...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Congress required the Small Business Administration (SBA) to implement a total of eight <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> to help facilitate small business lending and enhance liquidity in the secondary markets. These <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> include (1) temporarily requiring SBA to reduce or eliminate certain fees on 7 (a) and 504 loans; (2) temporarily increasing the maximum 7 (a) guarantee from 85 percent to 90 percent; and (3) implementing provisions designed specifically to facilitate secondary markets, such as extending existing guarantees in the 504 program and making loans to systemically important brokerdealers that operate in the 7 (a) secondary market. Further, ARRA established deadlines for SBA to issue regulations that implement certain <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as those pertaining to facilitating secondary market activities. Specifically, ARRA required SBA to issue regulations extending the guarantee related to the 504 program within 15 days after enactment (March 4, 2009) and for making loans to systemically important broker-dealers within 30 days after enactment (March 19, 2009). ARRA also mandates that we report within 60 days after the date of enactment, April 17, 2009, on SBA's initial efforts to comply with these provisions. In response, this report (1) summarizes key activities undertaken by the Administrator of SBA to implement the <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> including establishment of project plans with timelines for fulfilling responsibilities, and (2) analyze whether the Administrator is accomplishing the purpose of increasing liquidity in the secondary markets for SBA loans. Because SBA's efforts are still in their early stages, we agreed with the staffs of the House and Senate Committees on Small Business to focus our work on four key <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> {{the purposes of this}} report. These four provisions are eliminating or reducing fees on 7 (a) and 504 loans, extending the existing guarantee on 7 (a) loans, and taking two specific steps to facilitate activities in the secondary markets: extending the guarantee on 504 financing and making loans to systemically important broker-dealers. However, consistent with ARRA's requirements, we are also providing information on the status of SBA's implementation of the other four <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions.</b> ...|$|R

The aim is to evaluate both regulations and their flanking policy. For the evaluation, road users, road authorities and, on a small scale, representatives of various organizations were questioned. A part of the flanking policy was aimed at road users, another part at road authorities. After introduction of the RVV 1990 and the BABW, road authorities were aware of the principle, but not of the accurate contents of regulations and provisions. Following introduction of the new RVV and BABW, police, judicial bodies and road authorities had many questions. In the course of time, these questions were answered through joint consultation between various bodies. Some of the questions suggested a need to modify the RVV 1990 and BABW. In retrospect, most organizations judged the updated RVV quite favourable. On the whole, the regulations have become clearer and the distinction between the RVV and the BABW is now better defined. But almost all organisations believe that the new RVV should be adapted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The International Health Regulations (IHRs) (2005) was {{developed}} {{with the aim}} of governing international responses to public health risks and emergencies. The document requires all 194 World Health Organization (WHO) Member States to detect, assess, notify and report any potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under specific timelines. Annex 2 of the IHR outlines decision-making criteria for State-appointed National Focal Points (NFP) to report potential PHEICs to the WHO, and is a critical component to the effective functioning of the IHRs. Methods The aim {{of the study was to}} review and evaluate the functioning of Annex 2 across WHO-reporting States Parties. Specific objectives were to ascertain NFP awareness and knowledge of Annex 2, practical use of the tool, activities taken to implement it, its perceived usefulness and user-friendliness. Qualitative telephone interviews, followed by a quantitative online survey, were administered to NFPs between October, 2009 and February, 2010. Results A total of 29 and 133 NFPs participated in the qualitative and quantitative studies, respectively. Qualitative interviews found most NFPs had a strong working knowledge of Annex 2; perceived the tool to be relevant and useful for guiding decisions; and had institutionalized management, legislation and communication systems to support it. NFPs also perceived Annex 2 as human and disease-centric, and emphasized its reduced applicability to potential PHEICs involving bioterrorist attacks, infectious diseases among animals, radio-nuclear and chemical spills, and water- or food-borne contamination. Among quantitative survey respondents, 88 % reported having excellent/good knowledge of Annex 2; 77 % reported always/usually using Annex 2 for assessing potential PHEICs; 76 % indicated their country had some legal, regulatory or <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> using Annex 2; 95 % indicated Annex 2 was always/usually useful for facilitating decisions regarding notifiability of potential PHEICs. Conclusion This evaluation, including a large sample of WHO-reporting States Parties, found that the IHR's Annex 2 is perceived as useful for guiding decisions about notifiability of potential PHEICs. There is scope for the WHO to expand training and guidance on application of the IHR's Annex 2 to specific contexts. Continued monitoring and evaluation of the functioning of the IHR is imperative to promoting global health security. </p...|$|R
