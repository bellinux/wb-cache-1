40|$|Abstract. A {{preliminary}} study {{undertaken by the}} CSIR in July 1993 on {{the health effects of}} <b>aerial</b> <b>crop</b> <b>spraying</b> of pesticides in the Vaalharts irrigation area in South Africa indicated that potential health risks could exist for the inhabitants of this area. An extensive scientific health risk assessment and epidemiologi-cal study to determine the actual health risks, is very expensive and requires medical and financial justification. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a theoretical health risk model, which could be used as a predictive tool to determine as accurately as possible from the data available if a complete scientific health risk assessment study is justified. The actual amounts of pesticides sold in the Vaalharts area by two major pesticide manufacturers were used to perform a theoretical health risk assessment. The risks were assessed by making use of RISK*ASSISTANT, a computer modeling system and chemi...|$|E
50|$|Moscow ARZ ROSTO is a Russian {{charter airline}} based in Moscow {{as a unit}} of the Moscow Aviation-Repair Plant Rosto, {{established}} in 1997. It offers flights for hunting, advertising, aerial surveys and inspections, <b>aerial</b> herding, <b>crop</b> <b>spraying</b> and medical and emergency flights.|$|R
50|$|Barkol Airlines {{is a large}} Russian {{charter airline}} based in Moscow that carries out VIP charter flights (both on its own {{aircraft}} and on those leased from other airlines) as well as patrols of power, gas and oil lines, forest patrols, <b>aerial</b> photography and <b>crop</b> <b>spraying</b> (on its Antonov An-2, Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8 aircraft).|$|R
50|$|Other {{aircraft}} operations {{for which the}} FAA does not require an endorsement that typically require additional training are glider towing and aerobatics. The FAA also does not require an endorsement for some commercial activities like banner towing. <b>Aerial</b> application (<b>crop</b> seeding, <b>spraying</b> and dusting), whether conducted by a commercial certificate holder operating for hire or by a private pilot treating a crop {{in which he is}} the owner of a substantial share, requires an Authorization under Part 137 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe study {{measures}} {{intensity of}} attacks by Sitona lineatus L. on pea crops in farmersâ€™ {{fields and the}} resulting damage. Insect attacks were measured on the aerial parts of the plant at the vegetative stages and on roots {{at the start of}} flowering of the crop. Attack intensity varied between and within plots. Early sown crops were at greater risk of severe damage. There was a good correlation between leaf damage {{at the beginning of the}} crop cycle and damage to nodules at the start of flowering in unsprayed <b>crops.</b> <b>Aerial</b> <b>spraying</b> did not completely prevent nodule damage in crops severely injured by insects at the early vegetative stage. The effects of the attacks on nitrogen nutrition of the pea cropwere also assessed; these results are discussed with regard to the consequences for crop management...|$|R

50|$|In 2016 Downs {{launched}} a petition {{calling on the}} Prime Minister Theresa May to ban all <b>crop</b> <b>spraying</b> of pesticides near residents' homes, schools and playgrounds. The petition was signed by thousands of other rural residents also reporting adverse health impacts of <b>crop</b> <b>spraying</b> in their localities. The petition was also signed and supported by English barrister Michael Mansfield QC, along with other high-profile environmentalists including Jonathon Porritt, Gordon Roddick and Ben Goldsmith, amongst others.|$|R
