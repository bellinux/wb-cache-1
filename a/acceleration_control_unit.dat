The {{basis for the}} discussion is {{the results of a}} study of the effects of various <b>control</b> power (angular <b>acceleration</b> per <b>unit</b> <b>control</b> deflection) and angular velocity damping on pilots' opinions and on pilots' ability to perform precision tasks during hovering and low speed. The control response characteristics resulting in large improvements in the capability of the pilot-helicopter combination, particularly during instrument flight are discussed.

40|$|Abstract â€” The {{purpose of}} this study is to realize robust <b>acceleration</b> <b>control</b> using optical encoders. A {{quantization}} error of an optical encoder limits performance of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>control.</b> Hence, the study extends the premise of the S method, a high performance velocity measurement method, to acceleration measurement. The proposed method was shown to considerably improve the accuracy of acceleration measurements. High per-formance of <b>acceleration</b> <b>control</b> is realized due to the accurate measurement. Experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the aero-propulsion system {{acceleration}} optimal problem, the necessity of inlet control is discussed, and a fully new aero-propulsion system <b>acceleration</b> process <b>control</b> design including the inlet, engine, and nozzle is proposed in this paper. In the proposed propulsion system control scheme, the inlet, engine, and nozzle are simultaneously adjusted through the FSQP method. In order to implement the control scheme design, an aero-propulsion system component-level model is built to simulate the inlet working performance and the matching problems between the inlet and engine. Meanwhile, a stabilizing inlet control scheme is designed {{to solve the}} inlet control problems. In optimal control of the aero-propulsion system acceleration process, the inlet is an emphasized <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in the optimal <b>acceleration</b> <b>control</b> system.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>acceleration</b> <b>control</b> used by the servo systems to make their behavior robust against load torque and parameter variations. After demonstrating that the Torque Disturbance Observer (TDO) is equivalent to a particular <b>acceleration</b> <b>control,</b> the robustness of a servo system endowed with TDO is analyzed. Then it is shown that the deliberate set-up of a Feedback <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Control</b> (FAC) offers the designer more chances and theoretically brings the robustness of a servo system up to infinite. In practice, the physical constraint on the peak value of the servo current limits the achievable robustness. Taking into account such a constraint, it is proved that, compared to TDO, a suitable design of FAC improves the robustness of a servo system of the ratio between the rated values of peak and dc servo current. Simulation results illustrating the torque disturbance rejection and the current response for the two schemes are reporte...|$|R

40|$|WO 200275824 A UPAB: 20030111 NOVELTY - To {{produce an}} adaptronic micro system, {{one or more}} piezo {{electric}} fiber transducers (2) are embedded in a polymer matrix (1), {{with one or more}} <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (3) to <b>control</b> and/or carry signals. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> more strongly at the matrix. When the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are given an intermediate hardening. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can also be light waveguides. The transducers are piezo electric, magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems. ADVANTAGE - The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix, for the production of prepreg modules...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} how the visual-motor system recruits a novel {{visual feedback}} cue for a manual control task. We presented {{conditions in which}} an arbitrary cue (color) was coupled with task-relevant feedback (position or velocity), and measured {{the effect of the}} novel cue on performance. Participants used a joystick to keep a moving horizontal line centered on a display under velocity or <b>acceleration</b> <b>control</b> dynamics. Participants normally rely primarily on line position feedback for velocity control and line velocity feedback for <b>acceleration</b> <b>control.</b> The novel color cue was coupled with either line position (becoming red as it deviates from center) or line velocity (becoming red as it moves faster). For velocity control, performance error was smaller and response gain was larger when the novel color cue was coupled with line position than when it was coupled with line velocity. Conversely, for <b>acceleration</b> <b>control,</b> performance was better when color was coupled with line velocity than with line position. Our findings show that the visual-motor system can recruit a novel arbitrary cue to improve active control performance, but the effectiveness of the novel cue depends on its relationship to the feedback appropriate for control dynamics.
