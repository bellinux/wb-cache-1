40|$|A {{series of}} α-alkoxy- 3, 6 -dispiro- 1, 2, 4 -trioxanes have been {{synthesised}} by acid-catalysed perhydrolyses of α-alkoxy methylenecyclohexane oxides (provides ring A) to give selectively the corresponding 1 -hydroperoxy- 1 -(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexanes followed by acid-catalysed condensation with an appropriate cycloalkanone (provides ring C). Analogous perhydrolyses catalysed by MoO 2 (acac) 2 afforded mixtures of regioisomeric β-hydroxy hydroperoxides, albeit in overall increased yields. The resulting 1 - (hydroperoxymethyl) - 1 -hydroxycyclohexanes allowed {{entry to the}} isomeric 3, 5 -dispiro- 1, 2, 4 -trioxanes. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the isomeric dispiro- 1, 2, 4 -trioxanes revealed that (<b>a)</b> <b>they</b> <b>originate</b> from different diastereoisomers of the epoxide substrates, and (b) the 1, 2, 4 -trioxane rings of the 3, 5 -isomers adopt distorted half-chair rather than chair conformations {{as a consequence of}} intramolecular 1, 3 -diaxial steric interactions. Modelling studies of the perhydrolysis process are in broad agreement with the regioselectivity of the acid-catalysed reactions, but suggest that the α-alkoxysubstituted epoxides can act as bidentate ligands which can adopt different binding modes to the Mo catalyst and hence provide alternative reaction pathways. Thermolysis of dilute solutions of the α-alkoxy- 3, 6 -dispiro- 1, 2, 4 -trioxanes in decane afforded a variety of 13 -, 14 -, 15 - and 20 -membered fully ring-expanded keto lactones in high yield via stepwise, β-scission/radical recombination reactions in contrast to the partially ring-expanded oxalactones obtained previously from other 3, 6 -dispiro- 1, 2, 4 - trioxane derivatives. An investigation of substituent effects on the thermal rearrangement mechanisms of 3, 6 - dispiro- 1, 2, 4 -trioxanes using DFT calculations indicated that, after the initial O-O bond homolysis to form the corresponding oxy biradical, ring C generally opens significantly faster than the unsubstituted ring A because of the greater delocalisation of radical character into ring C. In these cases, the lowest rearrangement energy barrier links directly to the partially ring-expanded oxalactone product as observed experimentally. Methyl or methoxy substituents at the α-position of ring A render its ring opening by β- scission increasingly more competitive to that of ring C due to increased delocalisation of radical character onto the α-substituent, consistent with the ‘α-effect’. Methoxysubstituents are also noted to engage in close range interactions with the 1, 2, 4 -trioxane ring. Since the energy barrier for ring A opening falls below that of ring C in the methoxy model, formation of the fully ring-expanded keto lactone becomes favoured.

50|$|Historian William Henry Scott has {{observed}} that, based on lexicostatistical analysis involving seven million word pairs linguist Isidore Dyen offered in 1962, two alternative scenarios explaining {{the origin and}} spread of Austronesian languages: (<b>a)</b> that <b>they</b> <b>originated</b> in some Pacific island and spread westward to Asia, or (b) that <b>they</b> <b>originated</b> in Taiwan and spread southward. Based on subsequent study of the second alternative, Scott concludes that the Philippine language tree could have been introduced by Austronesian speakers {{as long ago as}} 5000 BC, probably from the north, with their descendants expanding throughout the Philippine archipelago and beyond in succeeding millennia, absorbing or replacing sparse populations already present, and their language diversifying into dozens of mutually unintelligible languages which replaced earlier ones. During those millennia, other Austronesian speakers entered the Philippines in large enough numbers to leave a linguistic mark but not to replace established languages. Scott suggested that if this scenario is correct all present Philippine languages (except for Sama-Bajaw languages, which probably have more speakers outside the Philippines than within) were produced within the archipelago, none of them being introduced by separate migration, and all of them having more in common with each other than with languages outside of the Philippines.|$|R

50|$|According to Marchand (1969), {{clippings}} are not coined as words {{belonging to}} the standard vocabulary of <b>a</b> language. <b>They</b> <b>originate</b> as terms of a special group like schools, army, police, the medical profession, etc., in the intimacy of a milieu where a hint is sufficient to indicate the whole.

Clipped forms can pass into common usage when they are widely useful, becoming part of standard English, which most speakers would agree has happened with math/maths, lab, exam, phone (from telephone), fridge (from refrigerator), and various others. When their usefulness is limited to narrower contexts, such as with tick in stock-exchange slang, they remain outside standard register.

How the males of the insect order Hymenoptera acquire centrosomes is <b>a</b> mystery, as <b>they</b> <b>originate</b> from virgin birth. Results: To address this issue, we observed centrosome, spindle and nuclear behavior in real time during early development in the parthenogenetic hymenopteran Nasonia vitripennis. Female meiosis was identical in unfertilized eggs. Centrosomes were assembled before the first mitotic division but were inherited differently in unfertilized and fertilized eggs. In both, large numbers of asters appeared at the cortex of the egg after completion of meiosis. In unfertilized eggs, the asters migrated inwards {{and two of them}} became stably associated with the female pronucleus and the remaining cytoplasmic asters rapidly disappeared. In fertilized eggs, the Nasonia sperm brought in paternally derived centrosomes, similar to Drosophila melanogaster.
