50|$|Abasol is {{a topical}} cream {{formulation}} of <b>abafungin</b> by York Pharma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abafungin</b> has {{antibiotic}} activity against gram-positive bacteria {{as well as}} sporicidal activity.|$|E
50|$|Unlike imidazole- and triazole-class antifungals, <b>abafungin</b> {{directly}} impairs the fungal cell membrane.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>abafungin</b> {{inhibits}} {{the enzyme}} sterol 24-C-methyltransferase, modifying {{the composition of}} the fungal membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abafungin</b> (INN) is a broad-spectrum {{antifungal}} agent {{with a novel}} mechanism of action {{for the treatment of}} dermatomycoses.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Imidazole, triazole, and {{thiazole}} antifungals=== Azole antifungal drugs (except for <b>abafungin)</b> {{inhibit the}} enzyme lanosterol 14 Î±-demethylase; the enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. Depletion of ergosterol in fungal membrane disrupts {{the structure and}} many functions of fungal membrane leading to inhibition of fungal growth.|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{contrast}} to the increasing numbers of agents {{for the treatment of}} invasive fungal infections, discoveries of new antifungal agents with therapeutic value in dermatomycoses are reported only rarely. Methods: <b>Abafungin</b> (chemical abstracts service registry No. 129639 - 79 / 8) is the first member of a novel class of synthetic antifungal compounds, the arylguanidines. It was first synthesized at Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany, and its antifungal action was discovered during the screening of H- 2 -receptor antagonists based on the structure of famotidine. To obtain insight into its mode of action and antifungal activity, various tests were carried out with different fungal pathogens in vitro. Results: <b>Abafungin</b> was found to have potent antifungal activity. Furthermore, mode-of-action studies suggested that <b>abafungin</b> exerts its antifungal activity regardless of whether the pathogens are growing or in a resting state. One target of <b>abafungin</b> was found to be the inhibition of transmethylation at the C- 24 position of the sterol side chain, catalyzed by the enzyme sterol-C- 24 -methyltransferase. A second action of <b>abafungin</b> seems to be a direct effect on the fungal cell membrane. Conclusion: The observed characteristics of <b>abafungin</b> indicate that <b>abafungin</b> might be a promising antifungal agent defining a new class of antimycotics. Copyright (C) 2008 S.
