5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> GR {{to work through}} (at least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> GR {{in such a way}} that it only operates through one of the two main possible pathways.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia {{in which}} each swimming style {{is associated with a}} vivid experience of a color. These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E
5|$|For lexical-gustatory synesthesia {{evidence}} {{also points}} towards ideasthesia: In lexical-gustatory synesthesia, verbalisation {{of the stimulus}} is not necessary for the experience of concurrents. Instead, it is sufficient to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> concept.|$|E

50|$|When <b>activating</b> <b>the</b> adenylate cyclase, Ras2 {{indirectly}} {{raises the}} cellular cAMP levels, thereby <b>activating</b> <b>the</b> PKA, by {{which in turn}} it is downregulated.|$|R
5000|$|Upon initial binding to the LRR {{region of}} FSHR, FSH reshapes its {{conformation}} {{to form a}} new pocket. FSHR then inserts its sulfotyrosine from the hinge loop into <b>the</b> pockets and <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> 7-helical transmembrane domain. [...] This event leads to a transduction of <b>the</b> signal that <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> G protein that is bound to the receptor internally. With FSH attached, the receptor shifts conformation and, thus, mechanically <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> G protein, which detaches from <b>the</b> receptor and <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> cAMP system.|$|R
5|$|Treatment of an ester or lactone with AlMe3 or AlMe2Cl affords the {{corresponding}} Weinreb amide in good yields. Alternatively, non-nucleophilic Grignard reagents such as isopropyl magnesium chloride {{can be used}} to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> amine before addition of the ester.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Balinor {{returns to}} Tyrsis to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> Border Legion {{only to find}} that it has been disbanded. Balinor is then imprisoned by his insane brother Palance Buckhannah, who has taken control of Callahorn's rule. His advisor, Stenmin, has driven Palance insane with drugs, making him his pawn. With help from Menion, Balinor escapes and confronts both Palance and Stenmin. Practically cornered, Stenmin stabs Palance as a {{distraction}} and flees.|$|E
50|$|Upon binding of LH to the {{external}} part of the membrane spanning receptor, a transduction of the signal takes place that <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> G protein that is bound to the receptor internally. With LH attached, the receptor shifts conformation and thus mechanically <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> G protein, which detaches from <b>the</b> receptor and <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> cAMP system.|$|R
50|$|Once {{returned}} to Earth, Vert is {{surprised to see}} his father at Tezla’s facility, and while given him a drive in Deora II, accidentally <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> Nitrox, accelerating the car to 300 mph, and <b>activating</b> <b>the</b> portal.|$|R
50|$|The {{controls}} are two-axis, with a side-stick that laterally <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> rudder to induce roll and which longitudinally <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> elevator for pitch control.

5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity.|$|E
5|$|On 18 October 2002 the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army {{approved}} the USAREUR and 7th Army Concept Plan to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> Theater Army Engineer Brigade (TAEB).

5|$|Special {{abilities}} are another {{important aspect of}} Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor's flagship, Grig Orig, destroys Zoah, but the Black Fleet {{intervenes}} before Edge and {{the dragon}} are killed. At the Tower, Craymen tells Edge {{it is one}} of several that manufacture monsters to combat humanity's destructive forces. He needs Azel to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> Tower and destroy the Empire before they can use it for themselves. Imperials arrive and capture Edge and Craymen. After the Emperor forces Azel to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> Tower, monsters emerge and kill Craymen, the Emperor, and their men. Edge and Azel escape on Edge's dragon. At the Seeker stronghold, Gash explains that the Tower will destroy humanity if it is not deactivated. He believes Edge's dragon is the prophesied Divine Visitor who will be humanity's salvation. Edge and the dragon battle rampaging monsters and destroy the infested Grig Orig.|$|E

5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> AH receptor, {{but less}} than TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor. This phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E
5|$|Zemus is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the game. He wishes to destroy the human race so that his people can populate the earth.

5|$|After encountering {{the three}} servile groups, the player begins {{to learn of}} a group of foreigners known as Sholai, explorers who have been shipwrecked on the island. It was the Sholai, led by a man named Trajkov, who {{attacked}} the player with their last remaining ship. Trajkov controls a device called the Geneforge, created by the Shapers, which can rewrite the user's DNA and make them incredibly powerful. This is the cause of the island's Barred status, the device was deemed too dangerous in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his followers have allied themselves with the Takers, absorbing the contents of canisters and trying to claim Shaper powers as their own. The group have been unable to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> Geneforge itself due to a Shaper being needed to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> device. A Shaper named Goettsch was kidnapped for this purpose, {{in the same manner as}} the player-character. Goettsch fled and stole the shaping gloves needed to safely use the Geneforge, causing Trajkov to attempt to kidnap the player as a replacement. During these events, some Sholai have escaped from their increasingly violent and unpredictable leader.|$|E
5|$|As Cochrane, Riker, and La Forge {{prepare to}} <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> warp {{drive on the}} Phoenix, Picard confronts the Borg Queen and discovers she has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him an array of new sensations. She has {{presented}} this modification {{as a gift to}} the android, hoping to obtain his encryption codes to the Enterprise computer. Although Picard offers himself in Data's place, the android refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix, but they miss because Data has betrayed her. Data ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive substance fatally dissolves the Borg Queen's biological components.|$|E
5|$|EVE {{brings the}} plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's {{recordings}} of Earth and concludes {{that they must}} return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded years earlier that the planet could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage chute, then detaining McCrea. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open, but McCrea is able to deactivate him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts the plant to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> hyperjump.|$|E
