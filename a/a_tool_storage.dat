In 1982 Tode excised 3.8 hectares of the property, which she donated to the State. This was gazetted as National Park 1828 (now part of the Clump Mountain National Park) on 17 March 1984. At her death on 22 February 1990, Tode bequeathed the remainder of the property (including the house) to the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS). Ninney Rise passed to her executors in late 1993 and was handed over to QPWS in 1995.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEnsuring the {{availability}} of tools in the dynamic production environment requires the optimization of decisions regarding tool provision. In industrial reality, choosing the storage area and the tool state as part of <b>an</b> optimal <b>tool</b> <b>storage</b> strategy is rather based on experience than on a systematic approach. Thus, the first {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify relevant factors and their possible specifications influencing the choice for the <b>tool</b> <b>storage</b> strategy. This is followed by an analysis of the influence on the choice for the storage area.

Several optimizations aim at adapting applications’ access patterns {{in order to}} generate contiguous accesses for improved performance when accessing storage devices like hard disks.

In this scenario, the information provided by our tool {{could be used to}} dynamically decide if optimizations are beneficial for performance, an important task to provide I/O throughput. In order to provide this information efficiently, SeRRa employs benchmarks to obtain the values for a subset of the parameter space and estimates the remaining values through a linear model.

50|$|Nicholas Sulentic (born 24 November 1887 in Croatia) immigrated from Croatia (then part of {{the former}} Austro-Hungarian Empire) to the United States in 1906, at age 15, living in Illinois and Wyoming before coming to Waterloo in 1916 to enter the grocery store {{business}} with his brother. Their business was located {{at the intersection of}} East Fourth and Adams Streets in a two-story brick building. He became president of North Waterloo Meat Co. and operated Pinkerton's grocery and bakery, the city's first supermarket, in 1921. He established a small factory on East Fourth Street but found the design of the valve spring compressor he had purchased was already protected by a patent. So, he invented his own device, a valve spring lifter, and combined it with a compressor. This device enabled garage mechanics to more easily gain access to parts within an engine. He founded Waterloo Valve Spring Compressor Co. in 1922. The company prospered and diversified from making tools to tool chests. The company was renamed Waterloo Industries in 1967 and became <b>a</b> successful <b>tool</b> <b>storage</b> manufacturer, with retail and industrial customers such as Sears (Craftsman brand), Lowe's, and Cornwell.|$|R
