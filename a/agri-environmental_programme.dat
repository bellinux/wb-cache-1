In this paper we analyse how co-financing influences policy-making in regions taking the case of the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme</b> in Saxony-Anhalt. Using an interactive linear programming approach the implications of several co-financing scenarios are analysed. EU co-financing certainly enhances the financial volume for the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme</b> in Saxony-Anhalt; but as regional policy-making is distorted by the scheme of mixed co-financing as compared to unconditional financial transfers, the priorities for measures vary depending on different EU co-financing scenarios. agri-environmental programmes, co-financing, federalism, interactive programming, policy-making, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

This paper examines the determinant factors influencing farmers' adoption of the EU-financed agri-environmental Nitrate Reduction Programme (NRP) in Greece and the extent of the programme's adoption, in terms of land allocation. The decision to adopt the NRP is modeled as a two-step procedure. First, farmers decide whether {{to participate in}} the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme</b> and second, the extent of participation is determined. We employ Heckman's self-selection bias correction model to derive unbiased estimates. Based on farm level data, we develop the profile of farmers who choose to adopt the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme</b> and the characteristics of their farms. The results of the analysis provide valuable policy insights decomposed into the main factors determining first, the adoption of the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme</b> and second, the extent of adoption. By decomposing the determining factors, policy makers can employ this information to design effective agri-environmental programmes, desirable to farmers and more targeted towards specific environmental and agricultural development goals.

The case under study requires a non-aggregated spatial distribution of the fields to be enrolled in an <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme.</b> A spatially explicit mathematical programming farm-based model, which accounts for three spatial levels (field, farm and landscape), is coupled with a relevant spatial pattern index (the Ripley L-function) to analyse the design and implementation of an <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme</b> aimed to preserve the Tetrax tetrax in the Plaine de Niort, France.

40|$|We analyse the {{adoption}} of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programmes,</b> i. e. extensive and organic crop production, in Switzerland for the years 2008 and 2009. While extensive crop production is adopted by about 60 per cent of all eligible farms, {{the adoption}} of organic crop production is very limited. Using logistic regressions we find that farms located in adverse production conditions (e. g. at higher altitudes) {{are more likely to}} be adopters of extensive crop production. Moreover, our results show that the probability of adopting organic production decreases with increasing specialisation in crop production. We find that organic producers tend to be slightly younger and better educated than other farmers. However, no differences in farmers’ age and education are found between non-adopters and extensive crop producers. This shows that, in general, the non-adoption of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programmes</b> in Switzerland is not primarily an educational problem. Moreover, we find that land tenure has no influence on {{the adoption of}} agri-environmental crop production schemes.

First, the development of measures taken under this policy is described from the 1980 ies until the present Agenda 2000, taking especially into account the effects of financial promotion by the EU. In addition, a view on nature conservation and water protection reveals the sometimes conflicting interactions between agri-environmental measures and other areas and instruments of environmental policy. In a second part, three sections describe identified problems resulting from {{the influence of the}} EU: the effects on the choice and design of agri-environmental policy instruments in the Federal States of Germany, the uncertainties and contradictions resulting in the area of property rights, and the controversially rated income effects.

40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years, <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programmes</b> in Australia have been {{underpinned}} by a neoliberal regime of governing {{which seeks to}} foster participation and ‘bottom-up’ change at the regional level {{at the same time}} as encouraging farmers to become entrepreneurial and improve their productivity and environmental performance without government interference. However, while experiencing a degree of success in terms of farmer involvement, considerable tensions are evident in such programmes. Drawing on an ‘analytics of governmentality’, this paper argues that while current <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programmes</b> enable authorities to combine often competing and contradictory imperatives under the rubric of single political problems—what has been termed hybrid forms of governing — it also contributes to the continuing failure of these programmes to achieve their desired effects. As a consequence, neoliberal forms of governing tend to be characterised by experimentation with a range of governmental technologies in order to make programmes workable in practice. We explore two different types of technologies—standards schemes and direct government regulation — that have emerged in recent years, and how these have sought to address the limitations evident in ‘participatory’ programmes. The paper concludes by arguing that while these initiatives seek to encourage farmer compliance in seemingly divergent ways, their capacity to be workable, and have broader effects, in practice will depend upon their capacity to manage the competing imperatives of environmental degradation, capital accumulation and private property rights...|$|R

We find that area-based income support measures entail low {{transaction costs}} as expressed in percent of payments, not only in Finland but also in other European countries. Moreover, transaction costs in the Finnish <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme</b> are surprisingly low. Within the <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programme,</b> transaction costs increase with more targeted and differentiated agri-environmental measures. For the basic mandatory measures, these costs are even lower than the transaction costs for the area-based income support measures. What regards the most differentiated policy measures such as conservation of special biotopes or establishment of riparian buffer zones, transaction costs increase considerably. Combining these findings with the actual targets of the Finnish agricultural policies provides indirect evidence about the impacts of policy instruments and the efficiency of administration in implementing the instruments. For area-based income support measures, the Finnish administration seems to work very efficiently. For water protection targets, enforcement and division of labour within the administration seem to be insufficient. ...|$|E

It shows that in particular farms with a small area under wheat, low levels of input use and low wheat yields adopted extensive wheat production {{in the first phase}} of the programme. If later adoption phases are included in a duration analysis, the difference in wheat area between adopters and non-adopters vanish. However, the level of wheat yields and input use still tend to be lower for adopters. Hence, less intensive producing farms (with lower yield levels) are much more likely to adopt extensive wheat production, which indicates free-riding effects. In contrast, more intensively producing farms, i. e. those farms that may actually harm the environment, usually not adopt extensive wheat production.

Environmental regulations influence main groups of Common Agricultural Policy instruments. In the I pillar of the policy, it refers to cross-compliance, in the II pillar it refers to <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programmes,</b> the Natura 2000 payments and organic farming support. In Poland they are ineffectively implemented and insufficiently directed to nature conservation. This refers both to domestic environmental and agricultural policy. In some aspects they are not coordinated. This is connected with delay in construction of protection plans which are necessary for proper policy in the Natura 2000 network. Consequently, the specialized payments for farmers in the Natura 2000 network have not been implemented yet while the extent in which agri-environmental measures have been implemented is too small. Moreover, the system of control and certification in organic farming does not involve requirements referring to biodiversity. There are some deficiencies in biodiversity protection standards within domestic regulations of cross-compliance.

Across all studies (109 observations for species richness and 114 observations for abundance), AEM significantly increased species richness and their abundance.

In croplands, species richness but not abundance was significantly enhanced in simple but not in complex landscapes. In grasslands, AEM effectively enhanced species richness and abundance regardless of landscape context.

The association between ecological and economic information was analysed statistically and with the help of GIS. The results indicate that the costs for landscape element protection differ within the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and that there is a lot of economic pressure against hedgerow biotopes existing in certain districts. Measures for protection such as <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programmes</b> should consider the different landscape-dependent costs. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Riparian {{corridors}} provide many {{functions in}} agricultural landscapes which contribute to {{water quality and}} ecological values. However intensification of dairy farms has degraded waterways and their functions within many regions of New Zealand. Waterways have been left unfenced and accessible to stock, {{which has led to}} increased sedimentation and contamination of surface water, and the loss of other riparian functions that rely on vegetation and clean water such as biodiversity, fishing, swimming, food gathering, and recreational activities. Increasing attention upon these issues both in the media and in public policy, and the perceived need to protect the reputation of the New Zealand dairy industry, has led dairy companies, regional councils and non-governmental organizations to develop voluntary <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>programmes</b> that encourage farmer suppliers of dairy companies to exclude stock from riparian corridors (including from main crossing points) and to progressively plant some of their riparian corridors. There have been surveys of progress towards targets set by these programmes, but little is known about farmers’ first hand experiences of the design and management of their riparian corridors. Through key informant interviews with farmers in a Canterbury case study, this research describes how dairy farmers are designing and managing their riparian corridors, and evaluates their effectiveness for meeting dairy farmer, regulatory and industry expectations...|$|R
