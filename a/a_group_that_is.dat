The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct from the}} dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, Moors and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.|$|E

500|$|Storytelling is {{an ancient}} form of {{entertainment}} that has influenced almost all other forms. It is [...] "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions". Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used {{as a component of}} any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on illuminated manuscripts and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones. Stories remain a common way of entertaining <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, Chaucer used pilgrims in his literary work The Canterbury Tales in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in Journey to the West. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.|$|E
500|$|Before production, the {{existing}} characters {{were added to}} the story either in places they would make sense to appear or as cameos from a list of characters suggested by the film's creative team, without consideration if they would legally {{be able to use the}} characters. The company then sought out the copyright holders' permissions to use the characters, as well as working with these companies to assure their characters were being represented authentically. In the case of Nintendo, the writers had early on envisioned the Bad-anon meeting with Bowser as a major character within the scene; according to Moore, Nintendo was very positive towards this use, stating in Moore's own words, [...] "If there is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to helping the bad guy characters in video games then Bowser must be in that group!" [...] Nintendo had asked that the producers try to devise a scene that would be similarly appropriate for Mario for his inclusion in the film. Despite knowing they would be able to use the character, the producers could not find an appropriate scene that would let Mario be a significant character without taking away the spotlight from the main story and opted to not include the character. Moore debunked a rumor that Mario and his brother character Luigi were not included due to Nintendo requesting too high a licensing fee, stating that the rumor grew out of a joke John C. Reilly made at Comic-Con.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{find out}} whether {{offering}} prenatal screening for Down syndrome and neural tube defects influences pregnant women's attitudes toward having a screening test. Methods: Women <b>were</b> randomised into <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> offered prenatal screening and <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not offered screening (controls). Both groups completed questionnaires before screening was offered, after the offer (not the control group), and in the last trimester of pregnancy. Results: Women with a neutral attitude at baseline who accepted the screening test had a more positive attitude, decliners became more negative and the attitude of the control group did not change. Conclusion: Offering prenatal screening triggers a change in some pregnant women's attitude regarding prenatal testing. This instability of women's attitudes may pose a problem for determining whether some women made an informed choice. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG...|$|R

Results: The number of women whose condition required insulin therapy was the same, regard-less of treatment. However, a subgroup analysis that examined only overweight women (prepreg-nant body mass index,O 25 kg/m 2) showed a lower incidence of insulin use in the diet-plus-exercise group (P!. 05). Women in the diet-plus-exercise group were prescribed less insulin (P!. 05) and showed a longer delay from diagnosis to the initiation of insulin therapy (P!. 05), compared with the diet-alone group. Conclusion:Resistance exercise training may help to avoid insulin therapy for overweight women with gestational diabetes mellitus...|$|R

Results of the PASS program at the University of Wollongong have been quite positive in that students, on average, who attend more PASS, achieve higher marks. However, a simple comparison does not control for self-selection bias. We control for self-selection in two ways. Firstly, we use Heckman’s two-stage correction technique to analyze the 2002 cohort. Secondly, students in the 2003 cohort were randomly allocated into three groups of equal size: 1. <b>A</b> control <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> allocated to normal tutorials with standard class sizes and ineligible to attend PASS; 2. <b>A</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> eligible to attend PASS and had normal tutorials of standard sizes; 3. <b>A</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> ineligible to attend PASS but allocated to normal tutorials with smaller class sizes.
