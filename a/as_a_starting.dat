The team used the prize money used to fund the No. 34 and No. 35 teams. Green drove the car again at Daytona <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> and park. Charles Lewandoski drove the car at Phoenix. Green drove the car {{for most of the}} season <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> and park, but was {{replaced}} for 3 races by Angela Cope. For 2012 the team changed number to 10, and Green once again drove the car <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> and park. However, when Green moved to the No. 14 Toyota Camry after Eric McClure's injury, Tony Raines and Kevin Lepage became the temporary drivers until McClure returned at Road America.|$|R

5|$|After leaving high school, Richard was {{selected}} by the Astros as the second pick {{in the first round}} of the 1969 amateur draft. From the time he made his major league debut with the Astros in 1971 until 1975, Richard had a limited role as an Astros pitcher, throwing no more than 72 innings in a season.

He debuted with the Yankees <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher in 2007. The Yankees traded him to the Nationals before the 2008 season, and the Nationals converted him into a relief pitcher in 2009. Clippard led the major leagues in holds in 2014. He {{was named to the}} MLB All-Star Game in 2011 and 2014, and won the MLB Delivery Man of the Month Award in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|Allemang {{was signed}} by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats before the 1977 season, {{and he went on}} to play in 31 games for the Tiger-Cats through 1978. He was used in a variety of roles. While Al Romano was injured in 1978, Allemang {{featured}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> defensive lineman. He later replaced the injured Bruce Holland as a defensive tackle. Outside of these brief stints as a starter, Allemang served as a back-up for both the offensive and defensive lines.|$|E

5|$|Alston {{joined the}} Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL in 2005, {{remaining}} {{with the team}} for three years. He played in 22 regular season games, recording 37 tackles, five sacks, and four forced fumbles. In the 93rd Grey Cup, Alston sacked the opposing quarterback in overtime, leading to a scoreless drive for the Montreal Alouettes and a 38–35 win for the Eskimos. Alston had several stints <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> player for the Eskimos, but {{his role as a}} starter was never consistent, partially due to injuries. He was released by the Eskimos after the 2007 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{his five}} {{years with the}} Indians he was {{primarily}} used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher, although he did display the versatility that would become his hallmark. He pitched in 139 games for the Indians, starting 100 and finishing 27. Early evidence of his versatility is demonstrated by his 41 complete games, 9 shutouts and 8 saves.|$|E
5|$|Gromek {{remained}} in the spot starter role with the Indians until 1953, when he {{was traded to the}} Tigers. The Tigers used him solely <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher, and had 18 wins in his first full season with them in 1954. He played two more full seasons with the Tigers, and retired during the 1957 season. Gromek then became a player-manager for the Erie Sailors for one year, became a car insurance sales representative after his retirement, and died in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Mayberry {{has been}} used {{predominantly}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> outfielder, despite some suggesting he is better suited as a platoon player. He hits for power, but strikes out frequently. He is a good athlete, with good speed, but does not steal many bases. Defensively, he is adequate, and possesses a strong and accurate arm. Mayberry has a degree in political science from Stanford. His father, John Mayberry, Sr., played {{in the major leagues}} for over a decade and was a two-time All Star.|$|E
5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E

5|$|Wilhelm {{grew up in}} North Carolina, {{fought in}} World War II, and then spent several years {{in the minor leagues}} before {{starting}} his major league career at the age of 29. He was best known for his knuckleball, which enabled him to have great longevity. He appeared occasionally <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher, but pitched mainly as a reliever. Wilhelm won 124 games, still the record for relief pitchers. He was the first pitcher to reach 200 saves, and the first to appear in 1,000 games.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Brooklyn, New York, Zoldak began his {{professional}} career in the low-level minor leagues, working his way up despite being released from his first team. The St. Louis Browns acquired him in 1944 and placed him on their major league roster. He debuted on May 23, {{and spent the next}} four years as a spot starter, working both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher and relief pitcher. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1948, and helped lead the team to the 1948 World Series. After two more years with Cleveland, he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics, the organization he originally started with, and played two seasons there. After a short minor league stint in 1953, he retired from the game, and died in 1966.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes {{was one of the most}} highly {{anticipated}} prospects in baseball, but his major league career has thus far been marked by inconsistency. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short his outing, as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues, eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June; pitching as a setup man for Mariano Rivera, Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
