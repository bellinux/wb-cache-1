5|$|The term 'bomber mafia' {{came from}} the {{sometimes}} bitter debates between United States Army staff and Air Corps men who observed, and argued with, the insistence by instructors <b>and</b> <b>students</b> <b>of</b> the ACTS that heavy bombers were the new primary weapon of war, and that a separate air arm was required to command them.

Kenney who called {{for the use of}} air power to attack enemy fighting units on the ground. He advocated the close coordination of air and ground forces, with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers. Kenney left ACTS in 1929, and heavy bomber doctrinarians filled the vacancy. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell himself, who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.|$|E
