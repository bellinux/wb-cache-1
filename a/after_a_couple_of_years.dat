5|$|These events {{coincided with}} the {{accession}} of Nero to the imperial throne in Rome, and the young emperor decided to react vigorously. The war, which was the only major foreign campaign of his reign, began with rapid success for the Roman forces, led by the able general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. They overcame the forces loyal to Tiridates, installed their own candidate, Tigranes VI, on the Armenian throne, and left the country. The Romans were aided {{by the fact that}} the Parthian king Vologases was embroiled in the suppression of a series of revolts in his own country. As soon as these had been dealt with, however, the Parthians turned their attention to Armenia, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> of inconclusive campaigning, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Rhandeia.|$|E

GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream.|$|E

One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career really got started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|Fernão Telles, {{the third}} Captain-Donatário between 1475 and 1503, {{was the first}} to attempt to colonize Corvo (contracting the Flemish {{entrepreneur}} Willem van der Haegen), but abandoned his settlement <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> By 1507, both islands of Corvo and Flores were identified by Valentim Fernandes as unpopulated. Diogo das Chagas also referred to an initial settlement of 30 people, under contract of Terceirenses Antão Vaz and Lopo Vaz de Azevedo (1508–1510), who had little success on Corvo; they eventually returned to Terceira in 1515, leaving António Silveira de Machado in charge. But the settlement did not persist. Following these successive failed attempts to settle the land, Gonçalo de Sousa (second Captain-Donatário of the islands of Corvo and Flores) was authorized to send slaves (likely from the island of Santo Antão, in the Cape Verde archipelago) to Flores and Corvo as farmers and cattlemen (12 November 1548).|$|E
25|$|The CFP franc is {{currently}} {{used as a}} euro pegged currency by three French overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia. The French government has recommended that all three territories decide in favour of adopting the euro. French Polynesia has declared themselves in favour of joining the eurozone. Wallis and Futuna announced a neutral standpoint, that they would support a currency choice similar to what New Caledonia chooses. However, New Caledonia has not yet made any decision, because they first await the fallout of an independence referendum, scheduled {{to be held at}} the latest in November 2018, as this might influence their opinion whether or not to adopt the euro. If the three collectivities decide to adopt the euro, the French government would make an application on their behalf to the European Council, and the switch to the euro could be made <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> If the collectivities fail to reach a unanimous decision {{about the future of the}} CFP franc, it would be technically possible to implement an individual currency decision for each territory.|$|E

25|$|No {{state was}} {{regarded}} by him with more aversion than Austria. Yet, {{his opposition to}} Austria was chiefly based upon her occupation of northeastern Italy and her Italian policy. Palmerston maintained {{that the existence of}} Austria as a great power north of the Alps was an essential element in the system of Europe. Antipathies and sympathies had a large share in the political views of Palmerston, and his sympathies had ever been passionately awakened by the cause of Italian independence. He supported the Sicilians against the King of Naples, and even allowed arms to be sent them from the arsenal at Woolwich. Although he had endeavoured to restrain the King of Sardinia from his rash attack on the superior forces of Austria, he obtained for him a reduction of the penalty of defeat. Austria, weakened by the revolution, sent an envoy to London to request the mediation of Britain, based on a large cession of Italian territory. Palmerston rejected the terms he might have obtained for Piedmont. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> this wave of revolution was replaced by a wave of reaction.|$|E
