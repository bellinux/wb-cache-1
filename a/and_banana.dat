5|$|In Jamaica, the {{hurricane}} dropped heavy rainfall but left little damage. Rains in the Dominican Republic caused flooding in the country's southwest portion. Flooding around Les Cayes in southwestern Haiti destroyed 60percent of the rice, corn, <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> plantations, while high waves wrecked several houses in Cavaellon.|$|E
5|$|Other outdoor tourist {{activities}} include wind surfing, parasailing, <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> boating. Attractions include Europe's largest waterpark, Sealanya, and Turkey's largest go-kart track. Hunting season also attracts some tourist for wild goat, pig and partridge hunting in area nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|Only 13days after Eline {{struck the}} country, Cyclone Gloria also hit northeastern Madagascar, {{bringing}} additional damage and flooding. The two storms collectively {{killed at least}} 140people, although there was initial uncertainty in the toll due to disrupted communications. Floods from the two storm inundated 70% of homes and wrecked 70% of the crops in the districts of Andapa, Sambava, Antalaha, and Vohemar. About 12,000people in 114villages were isolated. Rice fields were flooded for over a week, and coffee <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> crops had severe losses. Collectively, 12,230people were left without access to clean water.|$|E

5|$|Early in its duration, Lili caused {{flooding}} in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14people. Damage was heaviest in Cuba, mostly {{due to the}} hurricane's heavy rainfall which totaled 29.41in (747mm). The hurricane affected 11Cuban provinces, damaging 92,542houses and destroying another 6,369. The rains heavily damaged the sugar cane <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> crops, and overall damage in the country was estimated at $362million (1996USD). After 269,995people were evacuated in advance of Lili, there were no deaths in the country. In nearby Florida, one person died after being swept into a drain during the storm's heavy rains. Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States, which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried driving across a flooded roadway. Damage in the Bahamas was not severe, limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees. When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom, it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses, causing $300million in damage (1996USD) and six deaths.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{throughout}} the Windward Islands were substantial, but most heavily concentrated in St. Lucia. There, gusts reached 69mph (110km/h), toppling trees and power lines. Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's plantain <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. Farther west in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific rain event in four decades. An elderly man was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} drowning in his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads. Up to 35 people were killed there, though it was feared many more could die as Tomas exacerbated an already-deadly cholera outbreak.|$|E
5|$|In June 1869, Meessen and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to Batavia, and the following year they returned to Utrecht. There, in late 1870, Meessen partnered with Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen {{to open a new}} studio, named A.A. Vermeulen & Company. They signed a contract for five years, but this collaboration collapsed in March 1873. Boom and Wachlin suggest that Vermeulen– best known for portraits– had been interested in the possibility of expanding his range with landscapes, whereas Meessen required a place to print and market his images of the Indies. Indeed, in February 1871 Meessen gifted an album of his better-executed photographs from his time in Java and Sumatra to King William III. This album of 153images was lavishly decorated with silver and gold, and featured the names of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and Nias in the corners. In the center were silver coconut <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> trees surrounding Dutch and Batavian weapons.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} Winifred's approach, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone watches and {{warnings}} for various locations along the Queensland coast, prompting evacuations in several towns. Damage after landfall was widespread and severe, {{with thousands of}} homes damaged, flooding {{as a result of}} heavy rainfall along major rivers, and severe damage to crops. Debris obstructed roads across northern Queensland and power outages disrupted electrical service, even at water treatment plants, forcing officials to warn residents to boil water as a precautionary measure. Overall, the cyclone caused $86.4million in agriculture-related damages, with sugar cane <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> harvests suffering the most. Tourist operations were generally uninterrupted by the storm, while ecological and environmental damage, if any, was mild. Even so, high winds uprooted trees in wide swaths of forests, with those not completely defoliated. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and inflicted $130million (1986AUD; $154million USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage was heavy, with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of citrus trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} {{threat to}} mass-producing plants for harvest is their susceptibility to diseases. Wild species have {{a range of}} genetic variability that allows some individuals to survive should a disturbance occur. In agriculture, resistance through variability is compromised, since genetically uniform seeds are planted under uniform conditions. Monocultural agriculture thus causes low crop diversity, especially when the seeds are mass-produced or when plants (such as grafted fruit trees <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> plants) are cloned. A single pest or disease could threaten a whole crop due to this uniformity. A well-known historic case was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1847, where a vital crop with low diversity was destroyed by a single fungus. Another example is when a disease caused by a fungus affected the monocultured 1970 US corn crop, causing a loss of over one billion dollars in production.|$|E

5|$|In Grenada, Earl {{produced}} {{heavy rains}} and strong winds that caused moderate damage. On the main island, roofs were blown off twelve homes while three others were partially damaged; twelve trees and six power poles were also knocked {{down by the}} winds. The heavy rain associated with the tropical storm triggered nine mudslides and three rockslides on the island. Nearby, six homes had their roofs completely blown off while thirteen others were damaged. Flooding was also reported on both islands; however, no known damage resulted from them. During the storm, a nursing home had to be evacuated due to significant damage to the structure. On St Vincent and the Grenadines, at least two homes had their roofs blown off <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> crops sustained moderate damage. In Tobago, numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the island, cutting power to 90% of the island. The highest surface sustained winds in relation to Earl occurred {{on the morning of}} August 15 in Barbados and St. Lucia; winds were reported at 35mph (55km/h). One person was killed by the storm and nineteen others were listed as missing.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mitag passed near several {{islands in}} Yap State, first {{affecting}} Woleai. On the island, high wind gusts of around 170km/h (105mph) knocked out power and downed breadfruit and coconut trees. The winds destroyed a few houses, forcing residents to evacuate {{to a local}} school. Mitag dropped heavy rainfall while passing by Yap state, peaking at 255mm (10.05in) on Ngulu Atoll. On Yap, the typhoon produced sustained winds of 56km/h (35mph), with gusts to 141km/h (87mph). The winds also caused an islandwide power outage that lasted for about two days, and damaged {{the roof of the}} Yap International Airport terminal. High waves and storm surge damaged coastal structures and flooded areas up to 150m (500ft) inland. The seawall at the capital city of Colonia was damaged, and portions of the town were flooded 1.5m (5ft) deep. The storm destroyed over 150houses on Yap, leaving hundreds staying in shelters. Across the island, the winds knocked down trees onto roads, and saltwater intrusion caused severe crop damage; most of the taro <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> crops were destroyed. Damage in the FSM totaled $150million, of which $100million from crop damage.|$|E
5|$|Offshore impacts were significant; on 30January, {{the yacht}} Darkie washed ashore at South Brook Island, its crew of four surviving. Throughout Queensland, the cyclone {{isolated}} small towns, cut off telephone service, inflicted severe damage to crops, and generated widespread flooding. Between Cairns and Ingham, Winifred obliterated structures, toppled power lines, uprooted trees, wrecked 1000homes, and damaged hundreds of others. Service of the Sunlander between Gordonvale and Babinda was interrupted after tracks were inundated, and travelers {{were forced to}} travel by bus instead. At the latter city, approximately 500homes suffered significant damage, and at Innisfail, 200residences were destroyed. Several individuals were recovered safely from wreckage of a building collapse in each city. At Babinda, sixteen other structures were wrecked, with the cyclone unroofing an additional 50houses and flattening 40sheds. Five individuals were badly injured, two of them impaled by flying glass and other debris. Officials noted that the cyclone tore off the police station door and unroofed a Uniting Church. Helicopter reconnaissance indicated severe damage to sugarcane <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> crops {{as well as a}} critical electrical power tower, with considerable damage observed in the town proper.|$|E
