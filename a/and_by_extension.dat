5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism.

5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>extension</b> the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry <b>and,</b> <b>by</b> <b>extension,</b> the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
