50|$|The {{disease was}} first {{reported}} from Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka in India in March 1957. The disease first manifested as an epizootic outbreak among monkeys killing {{several of them}} in the year 1957. Hence the disease is also locally known as Monkey Disease or Monkey Fever. The similarity with Russian Spring-summer encephalitis was noted and the possibility of migratory birds carrying the disease was raised. Studies began to look for the possible species that acted as reservoirs for the virus and the agents responsible for transmission. Subsequent studies failed to find any involvement of migratory birds although the possibility of their role in initial establishment was not ruled out. The virus was found to be quite distinctive and not closely related to the Russian virus strains. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> is however close to many other strains including the Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) and birds from Siberia have been found to show an antigenic response to KFD virus. Sequence based studies however note the distinctivenss of OHF. Early studies in India were conducted in collaboration with the US Army Medical Research Unit and this led to controversy and conspiracy theories.|$|E

The AHHase and ECDEtase of placentas from individual women who smoked were inhibited by the MAbs by 83 - 90 % and by 34 - 74 %, respectively. Benz[a]anthracene (BaA) -induced AHHase and ECDEtase in lymphocytes were inhibited 18 - 65 % and 30 - 78 %, respectively. The enzymes in both control and BaA-induced human cells in culture were inhibited to different extents. Both the AHHase and ECDEtase in control and BaA-induced monocytes and in normal liver were largely unaffected by the MAb. Thus, we have with the MAbs: (i) identified P- 450 s with a common antigenic site in placenta, lymphocytes, and human cells in culture; (ii) identified two forms of hydrocarbon-induced P- 450 s in lymphocytes, {{at least one of}} which is common with the induced P- 450 s of placenta and with a P- 450 form present in uninduced lymphocytes; (iii) identified two forms of P- 450 responsible for smoking-induced ECDEtase activity in placenta, one of which is also responsible for AHHase activity; (iv) shown that the P- 450 s of liver, basal, and BaA-induced monocytes are different from the MAb-sensitive P- 450 s of placenta and lymphocytes; (v) quantitated in several human tissues the percentages of control and inducible AHHase and ECDEtase that are dependent on the MAb-sensitive P- 450; and (vi) defined by HPLC the contribution of the MAb-sensitive P- 450 to the formation of specific benzo[a]-pyrene metabolites. The results demonstrate the value of MAbs for defining <b>antigenic</b> site <b>relatedness</b> for different enzymatic functions of P- 450 s and for identifying and quantifying the amount of a specific enzyme activity in a tissue dependent on specific P- 450 s. This study may be a prototype for the use of MAbs for phenotyping and mapping of P- 450 s responsible for specific metabolic reactions and, thus, may be useful in determining the relationship of P- 450 phenotype to individual differences in drug metabolism and carcinogen susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Scrub typhus is {{a common}} cause of undiagnosed febrile illness in certain {{tropical}} regions, but can be easily treated with antibiotics. The causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, is antigenically variable which complicates diagnosis and efforts towards vaccine development. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study aimed to dissect the <b>antigenic</b> and genetic <b>relatedness</b> of O. tsutsugamushi strains and investigate sero-diagnostic reactivities by titrating individual patient sera against their O. tsutsugamushi isolates (whole-cell antigen preparation), in homologous and heterologous serum-isolate pairs from the same endemic region in NE Thailand. The indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to titrate Orientia tsutsugamushi isolates and human sera, and a mathematical technique, antigenic cartography, was applied to these data to visualise the antigenic differences and cross-reactivity between strains and sera. No functional or antigen-specific analyses were performed. The antigenic variation found in clinical isolates was much less pronounced than the genetic differences found in the 56 kDa type-specific antigen genes. The Karp-like sera were more broadly reactive than the Gilliam-like sera. Conclusions/Significance: Antigenic cartography worked well with scrub typhus indirect immunofluorescence titres. The data from humoral responses suggest that a Karp-like strain would provide broader antibody cross-reactivity than a Gilliam-like strain. Although previous exposure to O. tsutsugamushi could not be ruled out, scrub typhus patient serum antibody responses were characterised by strong homologous, but weak heterologous antibody titres, with little evidence for cross-reactivity by Gilliam-like sera, but a broader response from some Karp-like sera.

Glycoprotein-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of antibody responses induced by RSV infection demonstrated that the F glycoproteins of subgroups A and B were antigenically closely related (relatedness, R approximately 50 %), whereas the G glycoproteins were only distantly related (R approximately 5 %). Intermediate levels of <b>antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> (R approximately 25 %) were seen in neutralizing antibodies from cotton rats infected with RSV of the two subgroups. Immunity against the F glycoprotein of subgroup A, induced by vaccinia-A 2 -F, conferred {{a high level of}} protection which was of comparable magnitude against challenge by RSV of either subgroup. In comparison, immunity against the G glycoprotein of subgroup A, induced by vaccinia-A 2 -G, conferred less complete, but significant, protection.

40|$|Influenza {{pandemic}} preparedness {{has focused}} on influenza virus H 5 and H 7 subtypes. However, {{it is not possible}} to predict with certainty which subtype of avian influenza virus will cause the next pandemic, and it is prudent to include other avian influenza virus subtypes in pandemic preparedness efforts. An H 6 influenza virus was identified as a potential progenitor of the H 5 N 1 viruses that emerged in Hong Kong in 1997. This virus continues to circulate in the bird population in Asia, and other H 6 viruses are prevalent in birds in North America and Asia. The high rate of reassortment observed in influenza viruses and the prevalence of H 6 viruses in birds suggest that this subtype may pose a pandemic risk. Very little is known about the replicative capacity, immunogenicity, and correlates of protective immunity for low-pathogenicity H 6 influenza viruses in mammals. We evaluated the <b>antigenic</b> and genetic <b>relatedness</b> of 14 H 6 influenza viruses and their abilities to replicate and induce a cross-reactive immune response in two animal models: mice and ferrets. The different H 6 viruses replicated to different levels in the respiratory tracts of mice and ferrets, causing varied degrees of morbidity and mortality in these two models. H 6 virus infection induced similar patterns of neutralizing antibody responses in mice and ferrets; however, species-specific differences in the cross-reactivity of the antibody responses were observed. Overall, cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies in H 6 virus-infected mice did not correlate well with protection against heterologous wild-type H 6 viruses.

Further characterization of the genetic and <b>antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> of recent GII. 4 variants (2008 b and 2010 cluster) was performed in this study.

Using serum samples from patients enrolled in a GII. 4 virus challenge study, significant cross-reactivity between major GII. 4 variants from 1998 to 2012 was observed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and HBGA receptor blocking assays. The overall abilities of GII. 4 NoVs to bind to the A/B/H HBGAs were maintained while their binding affinities to individual ABH antigens varied.

Our study aims to determine the relation between <b>antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> expressed by the Archetti-Horsfall ratio, and reduction of virus transmission of highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 AI strains among vaccinated layers. Two vaccines were examined, derived from H 5 N 1 AI virus strains A/Ck/WJava/Sukabumi/ 006 / 2008 and A/Ck/CJava/Karanganyar/ 051 / 2009. Transmission experiments were carried out in four vaccine and two control groups, with six sets of 16 specified pathogen free (SPF) layer chickens. Birds were vaccinated at 4 weeks of age with one strain and challenge-infected with the homologous or heterologous strain at 8 weeks of age. No transmission or virus shedding occurred in groups challenged with the homologous strain. In the group vaccinated with the Karanganyar strain, high cross-HI responses were observed, and no transmission of the Sukabumi strain occurred. However, in the group vaccinated with the Sukabumi strain, cross-HI titres were low, virus shedding was not reduced, and multiple transmissions to contact birds were observed. This study showed large differences in cross-protection of two vaccines based on two different highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 virus strains. This implies that extrapolation of in vitro data to clinical protection and reduction of virus transmission might not be straightforward. </p...|$|E
40|$|The <b>antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> of surface-exposed {{portions}} of M protein molecules derived from group A streptococcal isolates representing more than 50 distinct serotypes was examined. The {{data indicate that}} the majority of serotypes fall into two major classes. Class I M protein molecules share a surface-exposed, antigenic domain comprising the C repeat region defined for M 6 protein. The C repeat region of M 6 protein is located adjacent to the COOH-terminal side of the pepsin-susceptible site. In contrast, Class I M proteins display considerably less <b>antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> to the B repeat region of M 6 protein, which lies immediately NH 2 -terminal to the pepsin site. Surface-exposed {{portions of}} Class II M proteins lack antigenic epitopes that define the Class I molecules. Studies in the 1970 s demonstrated that M protein serotypes can be divided into two groups based on both immunoreactivity directed to an unknown surface antigen (termed M-associated protein) and production of serum opacity factor. These two groups closely parallel our current definition of Class I and Class II serotypes. Both classes retain the antiphagocytic property characteristic of M protein, and Class II M proteins share some immunodeterminants with Class I M proteins, although the shared determinants {{do not appear to be}} exposed on the streptococcal surface. Nearly all streptococcal serotypes associated with outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever express M protein of a Class I serotype.

The gene segments from the 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 formed clusters separate from North American swine lineage viruses, suggesting progenitors of the pandemic virus were not present in US pigs immediately prior to 2009. Serological cross-reactivity paired with antigenic cartography demonstrated that the viruses in the different phylogenetic clusters are also antigenically divergent...|$|E
40|$|Hybridization {{experiments}} using complementary DNA copies {{showed that}} 14 tobravirus i olates could {{be divided into}} three groups, comprising ten of tobacco rattle virus (TRV) serotype I-II, one Of TRV serotype III, and three of pea early-browning virus (PEBV), respectively. RNA from members of each group has much nucleotide sequence homology with RNA of {{other members of the}} same group but little or none with RNA from members of the two ther groups. The ten TRV serotype I-II isolates share extensive sequences in their RNA- 1 species, but show much diversity in their RNA- 2 species and in the <b>antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> of their particles. However, homology was found between the RNA- 2 sequences of isolates that are serologically closely related. Because strain CAM (TRV serotype III) is as different from isolates of TRV serotype I-II in nucleotide sequence, antigenic specificity and biological properties as is PEBV, it is now considered to be a separate virus and a return to its original name, pepper ingspot virus, is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of an active vaccination program, recently emerged strains of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Korea have caused significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In this study, we assessed the pathogenic and antigenic characteristics of a K-IIb type field strain of IBV that emerged in Korea since 2003, such as Kr/Q 43 / 06. Specific pathogen free 1 -weekold chickens exhibited severe respiratory symptoms (dyspnea) and nephropathogenic lesions (swollen kidneys with nephritis and urate deposits) following challenge with the recent IBV field strain. The <b>antigenic</b> <b>relatedness</b> (R value), based on a calculated virus neutralization index, of the K-IIb type field strain and K-IIa type strain KM 91 (isolated in 1991) was 30 %, which indicated that the recent strain, Kr/Q 43 / 06, is a new variant that is antigenically distinct from strain KM 91. This report is the first to document {{the emergence of a new}} antigenic variant of nephropathogenic IBV in chicken from Korea...|$|E
