5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was born of his obsession with actress Jodie Foster.

Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate <b>a</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Senator</b> who is running for president.

5|$|Jefferson Davis {{served in}} many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful.

As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union {{would have been a}} great challenge for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.|$|E
