40|$|Abstract. The {{assumptions}} of conventional whole-rock and mineral isochron radioisotope dating were tested using {{a suite of}} radioisotopes from two Precambrian rocks. Amphibolite from the Beartooth Mountains of Wyoming shows evidence of thorough metamorphism by isochemical processes from andesite by an early Precambrian magma-intrusion event. A diabase sill, exposed within the wall of Grand Canyon at Bass Rapids, formed by a rapid intrusion event. The event segregated minerals gravitationally, apparently starting from an isotopically homogeneous magma. Although K-Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Pb-Pb methods ought to yield concordant isochron dates {{for each of these}} magmatic events, these four radioisotope pairs gave significantly discordant <b>ages.</b> Special <b>allowance</b> was made for larger-than-conventional uncertainties expressed as 2 σ errors associated with the calculated “ages. ” Within a single Beartooth amphibolite sample, three discordant mineral isochron “ages ” range from 2515 ± 110 Ma (Rb-Sr mineral isochron) to 2886 ± 190 Ma (Sm-Nd mineral isochron). The diabase sill in Grand Canyon displays discordant isochron “ages ” ranging from 841. 5 ± 164 Ma (K-Ar whole-rock isochron) to 1379 ± 140 Ma (Sm-Nd mineral isochron). Although significant discordance exists between the K-Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Pb-Pb radioisotope methods, each radioisotope pair appears to yield concordant “ages ” internally between whole-rocks and minerals.

Theophylline (1 mmol/l) stimulated insulin release at all ages and was equipotent on 24 -day foetal pancreas in 3 =. or 16 =. mm-glucose.

40|$|A {{number of}} policy reforms have {{recently}} been announced by the Commonwealth government to encourage greater labour force participation by older people {{in the context of}} an ageing society. These policy reforms are generally supply side in orientation such as the removal of the Mature <b>Age</b> <b>Allowance,</b> or restrictions to the Disability Support Pension. In this paper it is argued that these pensions have historically been used to accommodate otherwise unemployed older male workers. A number of methods are used to quantify the level of hidden unemployment within the older male population over recent decades. Estimates of adjusted unemployment rates, which include hidden as well as official unemployment, reveal a very dramatic picture of unutilised older male labour beneath relatively modest official unemployment rates. It is argued that without complementary employment policy addressing the labour demand side these policy reforms will achieve little except to reveal the previously high levels of hidden unemployment in official unemployment statistic...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} parental influence on adolescent's consumer activities in Malaysia. A total of 4287 Form Four students from 32 randomly selected schools, with 80 percent of their parents, participated in this study. A majority of the adolescents were staying with parents in rural areas. The adolescents received some allowance and reported performing consumer roles. Chi square tests were conducted to determine parent-adolescent behavioral overlap and congruity of response. Adolescents tend to behave {{in a manner similar}} to their parents; both parent and adolescent perceptions pertaining to their interaction about consumption were congruent. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine factors significantly influencing adolescent-parent interaction about consumption and adolescent consumer activism. Parents income, number of siblings, and interval between allowances had a negative influence on adolescent-parent interaction about consumption. Sibling ranking, parental perception of the adolescent-parent interaction, and parent reported consumer practices had a positive influence on this dependent variable. Variance in consumer activism was significantly explained by the index of amenities, adolescent's <b>age,</b> total <b>allowance</b> received by the adolescent, adolescent-parent interaction, parent reported consumer practices and father's occupation. The results indicated that adolescents whose parent performed effective consumer practices tended to perform more of the socially desirable consumer behaviors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} restructuring of the welfare system for old age income security in Taiwan since the 1990 s that embraced a mixture of expansion, retrenchment, and consolidation, and to identify factors explaining this development. Substantial changes have taken place seen in three institutional areas, following different pathways:(1) initiation and expansion of a system similar to the basic pension system which based on various tax financed, status-differentiated old <b>age</b> <b>allowance</b> schemes targeted on people over 65 without any support of social benefits;(2) reform and retrenchment of the existing occupation-based social security system, including occupational social insurance schemes (since 1950 s), public pension schemes for civil servants (since 1960 s), and the mandatory occupational pension for employers (since 1984); (3) establishment of a national pension insurance system for the working-aged excluded from the occupation-based social security system mentioned above. I argue that this multi-dimensional restructuring {{is influenced by the}} interactions of three dynamic factors, namely: (1) the welfare system developed before the political transformation and its legacies; (2) the role and function of democratic elections and political parties in social interest representation; (3) the semi-presidential system for policy-making...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{structural}} fiscal deficit, Hong Kong SAR Government might adopt a {{more selective}} approach {{in the provision of}} social welfare. At the same time, Hong Kong population is aging rapidly in the coming two decades and the retirement protection becomes the challenge to policy makers. The Old <b>Age</b> <b>Allowance</b> (OAA), one form of public financial assistance to older adults, is consisted of two components: one is Normal OAA with lenient means-tested but the other one is High OAA which is universal. It is suggested to be combined with the Old Age Category of CSSA so as to provide greater and more selective support for the need. In a survey, we found that 70 % of 1, 867 middle-aged adults would definitely or probably apply for the OAA when they reach the qualified age whereas only 3. 8 % of them would definitely or probably not apply for the OAA. Both bivariate and multi-variate analyses revealed that those who would apply the OAA had higher financial needs than those who would not.

There is a separate equation for each half year of chronological age; and for pre- and postmenarcheal girls at ages 11 to 14. These are based on longitudinal data from 116 boys and 95 girls of the Harpenden Growth Study and the London group of the International Children's Centre longitudinal study. The bone age used is the revised version of the Tanner-Whitehouse standards, omitting the score for carpal bones (RUS age, TW 2 system). Boys aged 4 to 12 are predicted in 95 % of instances to within plus or minus 7 cm of true height, and at ages 13 and 14 to within plus or minus 6 cm. Girls ages 4 to 11 are predicted to within plus or minus 6 cm; premenarcheal girls aged 12 and 13 to within plus or minus 5 and plus or minus 4 cm, respectively; and postmenarcheal girls aged 12 and 13 to within plus or minus 4 and plus or minus 3 cm, respectively. Prediction can be somewhat imporved by allowing for midparent height. One-third of the amount that midparent height differs from mean midparent height is added or subtracted.
