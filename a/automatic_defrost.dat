50|$|Auto-defrost, <b>automatic</b> <b>defrost</b> or self-defrosting is a {{technique}} which regularly defrosts the evaporator in a refrigerator or freezer. Appliances using this technique are often called frost free, frostless or no-frost.|$|E
50|$|Meats and {{vegetables}} {{stored in a}} manual-defrost freezer will last longer than those stored in automatic-defrost freezers. This is because the temperature of a manual defrost freezer remains closer to -18 C while the temperature of <b>automatic</b> <b>defrost</b> freezers fluctuates, and because automatic-defrost freezers have drier air, thus the rate of sublimation increases.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, the {{refrigerator}} is manufactured by assembling the principle parts such as hermetic compressor, wire-on-tube condenser, roll-bond evaporator, capillary tube, overload protector with relay, refrigerator cabinet, <b>automatic</b> <b>defrost</b> mechanism, and thermostat control and multi-purpose compartment should be selected in level II to achieve both the objectives simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Most European {{refrigerators}} {{include a}} moist cold refrigerator section (which does require (<b>automatic)</b> <b>defrosting</b> at irregular intervals) and a (rarely frost free) freezer section.|$|R
50|$|In 1959 Zanussi {{launched}} the first “Supermarket” fridge with <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> and two compartments with separate temperature controls. At {{the end of}} the 1950s, Zanussi launched its “Tropic System” featuring a rounded style. Meanwhile the washing machines were already into the second generation, with front-loading, and five washing programmes, developed with an eye for the requirements of the important German market.|$|R
50|$|Freezer {{units are}} used in {{households}} and in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 {{years prior to the}} common home models. Most households use the freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style, which has been the basic style since the 1940s. A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting,</b> chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door.|$|R
40|$|Many {{innovations}} in refrigerator design rely on microprocessors, sensors, and algorithms to control <b>automatic</b> <b>defrost,</b> variable speed,and other features. Even though these features strongly influence energy consumption, the major energy test procedures presently test only a refrigerator's mechanical efficiency {{and ignore the}} ''software'' aspects. We describe a new test procedure where both ''hardware'' and ''software'' tests are fed into a dynamic simulation model. A wide range of conditions can be tested and simulated. This approach promotes international harmonization because the simulation model can also be programmed to estimate energy use for the ISO, DOE, or JIS test. The approach outlined for refrigerators can also be applied to other appliances...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaporator}} {{test stand}} has been designed, sized, constructed, calibrated and operated {{to investigate the}} evaporator performance degradation for low temperature refrigeration applications. Measurements have been taken of air- and refrigerant-side temperatures, refrigerant-side pressures, air- and refrigerant-side differential pressures, air- and refrigerant-side mass flow rate and the power consumption of the electric defrost heater. The system is designed {{to work as a}} commercial refrigeration system for low temperature applications including freezing and defrost cycles. A manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>defrost</b> control has been designed and tested. The calculated values are the air- and refrigerant-side capacities. The tests have shown that the system is able to accomplish all desired test conditions. The performance of the evaporator was evaluated continuously during testing. Its performance degraded constantly by accumulation of frost during each frosting cycle, which resulted in the loss of superheat towards the end of each cycle. The defrost operation could not restore the full capacity of the evaporator. The defrost cycle consists out of two phases, melting the ice and re-cooling the coil. The first phase melts all the ice of the coil but the drainage of the resulting water is incomplete. The re-cooling phase freezes the amount of water residue on the evaporator coil, which causes an accelerated frost formation in the following freezing cycle. All over this behavior causes an accelerated reduction in evaporator capacity and therefore earlier superheat loss. It has been investigated for two air flow rates. The comparison of cycles with different air flow rates showed that with an increased air flow rate the frost density increases and the free flow area of the air passage in the evaporator decreases more slowly...|$|E
40|$|The {{general-purpose}} laboratory refrigerator or freezer is an insulated cabinet with a {{door and}} a refrigeration unit that generates and maintains the required low temperatures. These units are used for storage of reagents, stock cultures, media, and patient specimens. When patient samples or cultures are stored in these units, a biohazard sign should be in plain sight. Never store food or drink for human consumption in a laboratory refrigerator. <b>Automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> freezers (frost-free freezers) {{should not be used}} because they periodically cycle through warm temperatures. These temperature fluctuations result in deterioration of reagents and other materials. For facilities with frost-free freezers already in place, a layer of frozen ice packs positione...|$|R
5000|$|Freezers with <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> and {{combined}} refrigerator/freezer units which also apply self defrosting to their freezer compartment are called [...] "frost free". The latter usually feature an air {{connection between the}} two compartments with the air passage to the refrigerator compartment regulated by a damper. By this means, a controlled portion of the air coming from the freezer reaches the refrigerator. Some older models have no air circulation between their freezer and refrigerator sections. Instead, they use an independent cooling system (for example: an evaporator coil with a defrost heater and a circulating fan in the freezer and a cold-plate or open-coil evaporator in the refrigerator.|$|R
5000|$|Many newer units employ <b>automatic</b> <b>{{defrosting}}</b> (often called [...] "frost-free" [...] or [...] "no frost") and do {{not require}} manual defrosting in normal use. Although, in some cases, users of Frost Free fridge/freezers have noted ice blocking the vent that allows air into the refrigerator compartment. All refrigerators and/or freezers whether or not frost free, should be defrosted at least every 6 months (or more {{if you live in}} humid conditions or if the door is opened excessively).Frost Free units should be defrosted every year, as frost can form on the evaporator covers, which can look unsightly and degrades freezing performance, sometimes to the point of the freezer thawing out due to degradation of defrosting. This can happen when the defrost timer is not set up correctly/malfunctioning or if the heater units or temperature sensors are malfunctioning.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s {{and provided a}} safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants. Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at {{the time for the}} unit was a deep freeze. These devices, or appliances, did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II. The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> and <b>automatic</b> ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though environmental issues led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the Postum Company (the forerunner of General Foods), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to Clarence Birdseye's successful fresh freezing methods.|$|R
50|$|Early freezer units {{accumulated}} {{ice crystals}} around the freezing units. This {{was a result}} of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing ("defrosting") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for {{a short amount of time}} to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.These older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around , which is suitable for keeping food for a week.|$|R
40|$|The Italian orange fruit export {{development}} outside EU {{countries has}} required commercial agreements regarding the restriction of parasites spread especially Mediterranean fruit fly. The correct use of cold treatment during the shipment {{is used to}} satisfy this requirement. This paper reports {{the results of a}} simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruits (14600 kg of ‘Tarocco’ oranges) in a 40 ft refrigerated container. Temperatures have been monitored inside the refrigerated container in different positions of the load (in the air, in the pallet and in the fruits) using 40 innovative direct-to-digital temperature probes. Moreover, an innovative package (with an increased vented surface) was compared to the standard boxes. Results show that the difference of average temperature between the temperature probes in head space was less than 0. 5 °C. Temperature peaks showed the on/off cycle of the <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> system. Though temperature probes placed on the floor showed a good homogeneity, the air temperature reached a minimum level of about - 0. 8 °C, near the cold air outlet, which is considered too low for the oranges cold storage. The vented boxes allowed a more rapid cooling, lowering the overall thermal resistance of fruit boxes, and so making fruits mostly affected by the cold air temperature near the air cooler outlet...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper are {{discussed}} the results of simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruit at industrial scale. Fruit temperature distribution in a refrigerated cargo (reefer) has been studied {{in order to reduce}} the temperature difference in the load, to increase quality and shelf life after shipment. The mean temperature difference between the probes placed in the head space was shorter than 0. 5 °C while graphic peaks showed the temperature increase due to the on/off cycle of the <b>automatic</b> <b>defrosting</b> system. The temperature was also more than 10 °C higher than the mean registered value, and leads to a partial warming of the product. This undesired effect appears less important when the distance of the probe is higher respect to the air-cooler. Data concerning the probes placed on the container floor demonstrated a good result in terms of temperature homogeneity, but temperature reached a minimum level of about - 0, 8 °C (when the cooling system started) which can be considered too low for orange fruits storage, due to the risk of cold damage rising (about - 1, 0 °C). Vented boxes allow a more rapid cooling and a more accurate temperature control, probably due to the presence of the vent openings and, consequently, the less thermal resistance. Indeed citrus fruits placed in the vented boxes show a temperature variation like the environment cold air, while the fruits in the classic boxes show a great inertia to modify their temperature. Therefore, using the vented boxes need a precise control of the container air temperature, as any air temperature fluctuation can lead to a fruit quality decrease. The container for citrus fruit transport has to be suitable for cooling; every container for food freezing is not suitable for the scope; indeed the low evaporation temperatures could lead the rising of fruit cold damages...|$|R
5000|$|The Ford Aspire {{was sold}} in North America from 1993 to 1997. It was the {{replacement}} for the Ford Festiva. It was the first car in its class to have dual airbags standard and antilock brakes optional. It came in two and four door body styles, both hatchbacks. The two door was available in base and SE trim while the four door was only available in base trim. The SE model offered a sporting package that consisted of fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, blue face instrument cluster with tachometer, and upgraded interior trim. The Aspire had very few options for the base model: cassette player, <b>automatic</b> transmission, rear <b>defrost</b> and wiper, alloy wheels, and a comfort and convenience package that had several minor interior upgrades. Due to slow sales the SE model was dropped after 1995 along {{with all of its}} optional equipment. The base model also lost its optional alloy wheels and rear wiper, making the Aspire a true [...] "stripper" [...] of a car. The performance with the five-speed was acceptable but the automatic was slower with 0-60 times at 16.2 seconds. Power steering was only available with the five-door automatic. The Aspire was given a facelift in 1997 with redesigned front and rear bumpers, a new radio, and new seat facings. In August 1997, Ford announced the Aspire would be discontinued due to slow sales. The last one rolled off the assembly line on September 26, 1997.|$|R
