5000|$|Frankie Avalon later recalled, [...] "Thats {{the picture}} of mine that I think people {{remember}} best, {{and it was just}} a lot of kids having a lot of fun -- a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people. Theres nothing that young people respond to more than when adults say, `These kids are nuts,` <b>and</b> <b>thats</b> <b>what</b> this movie was about. It was also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane." ...|$|E

[...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "Its been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind. I dont know anybody in the world working in film, <b>and</b> <b>thats</b> <b>what</b> we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million." [...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. You know, when people talk about The Twilight Zone, they say Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"? Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original Star Trek. Jose Chung is going to be one of those episodes that is immediately revered." [...] Assistant director Tom Braidwood appreciated Charles Nelson Reillys presence, saying that he captivated virtually everyone and gave everyone a lift, nicknaming everyone on the crew.

Brawley, MD, said"Many experts had {{anticipated}} these studies would show {{a small number}} of men will benefit from prostate screening, but a large number of men will be treated unnecessarily. <b>And</b> <b>thats</b> <b>what</b> these studies show. However, the question is not as simple as: does prostate cancer screening work? What we need to know is: what are benefits of prostate cancer screening and are they large enough to outweigh the harms associated with it? And despite the release of this early data, we still cannot say whether the benefits outweigh the risk." ...|$|E

So everyone was working on the same level with the same goals in mind. What we {{wanted to get out of}} it was a bit darker, a bit harder. Its a very kind of upbeat record <b>and</b> <b>thats</b> <b>what</b> I like to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Louder Than the Musics Jono Davies {{said that}} [...] "Of {{course there are}} one or two songs that stand out more than others, with the title track being one of them. But I found myself worshipping during the whole album, <b>and</b> <b>thats</b> <b>what</b> this album wants you to do. When Israel and the band sing, {{something}} special happens.

5000|$|I {{admire the}} rap and the break dancing {{and all the}} stuff coming out of hip hop. A lot of the records are {{messages}} that express community problems.

Thats what my song [...] "Brother Rapp" [...] is all about. A fella is calling on his lady and protesting at the same time: [...] "Dont put me in jail before I get a chance to rap.

5000|$|According {{with her}} the first version also {{contained}} a dubstep breakdown, which was removed for Lovato. He also stated, [...] "Demi has magic to it where she has so much sass in her voice but yet so much power and all those really high notes at the end, she added that on the spot." [...] Williams described the song, said: [...] "Its about me being really scared {{to fall in love}} again after being rejected, after feeling so fragile and vulnerable all the time — thinking, I dont know if I can do this ever again!" [...] Lovato told on MTV, about the songs lyrical address to [...] "falling in love and taking that risk". But, shes terrified and, by she, I mean me.

5000|$|The songs main riff {{was also}} {{featured}} {{on an earlier}} recording with different lyrics, titled [...] "Dirty Eyes", which saw official release on Volts, part of the Bonfire box set. [...] "Dirty Eyes" [...] features a different chord progression in the chorus and does not contain the [...] "band duel" [...] featured in [...] "Rosie." [...] In AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, Malcolm Young is quoted, [...] "We were always big fans of early rock and roll, like Elvis and Heartbreak Hotel, things like that - the stop-and-start things, the dynamics. If anything, for Whole Lotta Rosie {{we were looking for}} a feel like Little Richard, a good steamin rock feel, and see what we could lay on top with the guitars. It evoked that, but youre just looking for the vibe, whats exciting, <b>and</b> <b>thats</b> <b>what</b> we were listening to. Simple to put together, but still around like a classic." ...|$|E
5000|$|By 1994, the {{magazine}} was doing cover stories on Beastie Boys, Henry Rollins and Love and Rockets. Norman Wonderly, now the publisher, was credited by Shea as having [...] "made most of these happen and the more Norman got what he wanted, the more artists wanted their cover shoots to look the way Norman wanted, and so on. It wasn’t always easy; there were some nasty phone calls exchanged between everyone, {{and there was always}} some publicist who wanted to give us one half-hour of shoot time so the artist could go shopping or some stupid thing. Did we sometimes protest too much? Maybe, but we were up against a lot; we were underfinanced and still underappreciated in some corners of the music business, so we had to fight scrappily and mean when it was called for. Nobody takes you seriously unless you take yourself seriously, <b>and</b> <b>thats</b> <b>what</b> Norman brings to his position to this day".|$|E
