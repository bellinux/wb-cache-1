5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
5|$|Legree {{begins to}} hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and {{resolves}} to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, however, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> the other slaves {{as best he}} can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.|$|E
25|$|So Thommo begins - {{the high}} {{stepping}} gait of a thoroughbred, bowling hand bobbing at waist {{level and the}} ball visible. It is conventional <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> because facing a strange bowler {{for the first time}} invariably generates edginess. Then, in the split second before delivery, at gather, Thommo drags one leg behind the other in a sort of Swan Lake crossover, sways back and hides the ball behind his right knee - unconventional and very unsettling.|$|E
40|$|Subjects {{were exposed}} to {{sequences}} of partial-body cooling and warming {{over a period of}} three hours. Skin temperatures, core temperature, thermal sensation, <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> responses were collected for nineteen local body parts, and for the whole body. This paper relates local thermal sensations <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> to skin <b>and</b> core temperatures, and examines how the thermal sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> perceived for individual body parts affect thermal sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> perceived for the whole body. Overshoot in sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> is stronger when local body parts are cooled or warmed than when the whole body experiences a step-change...|$|R
30|$|The {{method to}} assess the {{mobility}} <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> impacts of ITS on vulnerable road users was developed from the method introduced by Kulmala (2010), initially developed {{for the assessment of}} safety impacts of ITS for cars. The method for mobility <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> impact assessment followed the steps defined by Kulmala (2010), but when assessing mobility <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> numbers 1 – 5 (<b>comfort)</b> <b>and</b> 6 – 8 (mobility) were of interest. The method was enhanced and adjusted to take into consideration the mobility <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> of vulnerable road users covering: mobility and exposure of vulnerable road users measured in: trip length, duration <b>and</b> frequency; <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> of vulnerable road users measured in: how the users perceive their travel, i.e., change their opinion regarding the comfort of the travel undertaken, and perceived safety in relation to traffic.|$|R
40|$|Subjects {{exposed to}} uniform environments were polled for their local and overall (whole-body) thermal {{sensation}} <b>and</b> <b>comfort.</b> Sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> for local body parts vary greatly. In cool environments, {{hands and feet}} feel colder than other body parts. The head, insensitive to cold but sensitive to warm, feels warmer {{than the rest of}} the body in warm environments. Overall sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> follow the warmest local sensation (head) in warm environments and the coldest (hands and feet) in cool environments. Subjects evaluate neutral conditions as “comfortable”, never “very comfortable”, and overshoot of sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> during wholebody step-changes is small...|$|R

He spent much time listening to <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> people of all ages, and brought hundreds of people back to religious observance through his passionate public speeches.|$|E
25|$|Death of a {{child can}} {{take the form of}} a loss in infancy such as {{miscarriage}} or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it. Intervention <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> support can make all the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.|$|E

The protective clothing should provide adequate protection as well as should be comfortable to wear. The protection <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> requirements are always the contradicting fact in several protective clothing including fire-fighters’. Appropriate material selection, clothing design and final evaluation of the results {{play a critical role in}} predicting the clothing performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort.</b> Several researches have been done on the performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> improvement of fire-fighter’s protective clothing. However, detailed review related to these parameters is not being reported in recent years. In this perspective review, we report the recent trends in the performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> properties of the fire-fighters protective clothing. The clothing design and different materials used to achieve a balance between performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> is illustrated. Various test standards related to the performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> is also being discussed.

25|$|Tulsidas was {{inspired}} by Adhyatma Ramayana, where Rama and other characters of the Valmiki Ramayana along with their attributes (saguna narrative) were transposed into spiritual terms and abstract rendering of an Atma (soul, self, Brahman) without attributes (nirguna reality). According to Kapoor, Rama's life story in the Ramacharitamanasa combines mythology, philosophy and religious beliefs into a story of life, a code of ethics, a treatise on universal human values. It debates in its dialogues the human dilemmas, the ideal standards of behavior, duties to those one loves, and mutual responsibilities. It inspires the audience to view their own lives from a spiritual plane, encouraging the virtuous to keep going, <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> those oppressed with a healing balm.|$|E

Discussing her evolving characterisation, Little writes: [...] "She hasn't always been the incarnation of lovable joviality: when she arrived in the Street in 1969, she was loud, brash and a vicious-tongued gossip." ...|$|E

500|$|These two popular goals {{coalesced}} {{around a}} third that was largely the revolutionaries' idea, {{which was that}} the king and his court, and the Assembly as well, must all be moved to Paris to reside among the people. Only then would the foreign soldiers be expelled, food be reliably available, and France served by a leader who was [...] "in communion with his own people". The plan appealed to all segments of the crowd. Even those who were innocently supportive of the monarchy (and there were many among the women) felt the idea of bringing home le bon papa was a good <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> plan. For revolutionaries, the preservation of their recent legislation {{and the creation of}} a constitution were paramount, and a lockdown of the king within reformist Paris would provide the best possible environment for the Revolution to succeed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} act, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages {{on a farm}} in 1985.

At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of [...] "deferral" [...] – a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and jealousy causes Kathy and Ruth to break their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a [...] "carer" [...] – a clone who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> donors as they are made to give up their organs.

Tucker still angrily insists he did not kill her, and he agrees to submit to a {{polygraph}} test. When Bayliss leaves, Pembleton speaks to Tucker in a soft <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> tone, trying to get Tucker to trust him. Pembleton suggests Tucker had a drink and blacked out the night he killed Adena, and he seems close to getting a confession before Tucker once again insists he is innocent. With four hours left before the deadline, Bayliss returns and says Tucker failed the polygraph test. Bayliss and Pembleton then aggressively team up on Tucker, talking quickly and intimidating him with repeated questions. They bring up a previously dropped statutory rape charge against Tucker involving a 14-year-old girl, then suggest he attempted {{to have sex with}} Adena and killed her because she resisted. They confront Tucker with gruesome crime scene photos of Adena and ask him if he is sure he didn't kill her, to which a frightened and confused Tucker replies, [...] "Not right now, I'm not." ...|$|E

His lawyers successfully advance a force majeure argument; {{as a result the}} Governor of Kentucky is reluctantly forced to release Danes on parole. Oswald accepts an offer of representation from PR guru Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose) after his fame leads to him being assaulted in public, leading to him becoming a spokesman for Phicorp, a drug company hoping to capitalise on the absence of death. During Torchwood's investigations into PhiCorp, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) confronts Danes, who admits the falsity of his expressed remorse. Tensions arise between Kitzinger and Danes when he is eclipsed in the media by Tea Party politician Ellis Hartley Monroe (Mare Winningham) and her [...] "Dead is Dead" [...] campaign. Danes launches an ad hoc publicity stunt; a video of Danes holding <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> a baby girl goes viral and results in Monroe's media attention waning.

He wrote to his brother, Theo, [...] "What I have done is a rather hard and coarse reality beside their abstractions, but it will have a rustic quality and will smell of the earth." [...] Rather than attempting to recreate what the scene might have been like, he explained [...] "one can express anguish without making reference to the actual Gethsemane, and... {{there is no need to}} portray figures from the Sermon on the Mount in order to express a gentle <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> feeling."

500|$|According to {{academic}} Brigid Cherry, nostalgia [...] "is a strong element of {{certain kinds of}} cult appeal." [...] When Veoh added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity. Academic I. Q. Hunter describes cult films as [...] "New Hollywood in extremis" [...] and a form of nostalgia for that period. [...] Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia {{as a form of}} resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time-based economy. [...] By virtue of the time travel plot, Back to the Future permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s. [...] Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period. [...] Similarly, films directed by John Hughes have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism. [...] Mathijs and Sexton describe Grease (1978) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following. [...] Other cult films, such as Streets of Fire (1984), create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past. [...] Cult films may also subvert nostalgia, such as The Big Lebowski, which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow. [...] Author China Miéville praises the use of satire in Donnie Darko for its avoidance of falling into facile <b>and</b> <b>comforting</b> nostalgia, but Nathan Lee of the New York Sun identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds.|$|E
