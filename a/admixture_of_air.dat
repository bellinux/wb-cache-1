This Standard covers {{requirements}} for manually operated metallic valves in nominal sizes 2 ½ (DN 65) through 12 (DN 300) having the inlet and outlet {{on a common}} centerline. These valves are intended for controlling the flow of gas from open to fully closed positions, for use in distribution and service lines where the maximum gage pressure does not exceed 125 psig (8.6 bar).

40|$|Treatment {{of samples}} with plasmas in {{biomedical}} applications often occurs in ambient air. Admixing air into the discharge region may severely affect the formation and destruction of the generated oxidative species. Little {{is known about the}} effects of air diffusion on the spatial distribution of OH radicals and O atoms in the afterglow of atmospheric-pressure plasma jets. In our work, these effects are investigated by performing and comparing measurements in ambient air with measurements in a controlled argon atmosphere without the <b>admixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> for an argon plasma jet. The spatial distribution of OH is detected by means of laser-induced fluorescence diagnostics (LIF), whereas two-photon laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF) is used for the detection of atomic O. The spatially resolved OH LIF and O TALIF show that, due to the air admixture effects, the reactive species are only concentrated {{in the vicinity of the}} central streamline of the afterglow of the jet, with a characteristic discharge diameter of similar to 1. 5 mm. It is shown that air diffusion has a key role in the recombination loss mechanisms of OH radicals and atomic O especially in the far afterglow region, starting up to similar to 4 mm from the nozzle outlet at a low water/oxygen concentration. Furthermore, air diffusion enhances OH and O production in the core of the plasma. The higher density of active species in the discharge in ambient air is likely due to a higher electron density and a more effective electron impact dissociation of H 2 O and O- 2 caused by the increasing electrical field, when the discharge is operated in ambient air...|$|E

40|$|Recent direct {{measurements}} of N 2 and O 2 vibrational populations in expansions <b>of</b> synthetic <b>air</b> show a closer coupling of the vibrational energies than indicated by adapting earlier experimental results from shock compressions to the nozzle expansion problem. An important {{difference between the}} shock wave and nozzle flow problems {{is the presence of}} NO in significant amounts throughout the relaxation {{in the case of a}} nozzle flow. This may account for the stronger coupling since NO is well suited to promote vibrational energy exchange. The results of a series of experiments and analysis examining vibrational energy coupling in expansions <b>of</b> <b>admixtures</b> approximating <b>air</b> are reported. N 2 and O 2 vibrational populations are determined by a single-pulse spontaneous Raman scattering technique. NO vibrational populations are determined by broadband absorption by the NO(y) system.

40|$|Abstract: The {{temperature}} of the deposits (Tdep) emplaced by the pyroclastic density current (PDC) generated by the seven major explosive eruptions from Somma–Vesuvius during the last 22 kyr were investigated using the thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) of lithic clasts embedded within the deposits. New data are presented for the Pomici di Base, Greenish Pumice, Mercato and 1631 AD deposits and compared to the literature data from the Avellino, 79 AD-Pompeii and 472 AD-Pollena eruptions. The Tdep mainly fall in the range 270 – 370 8 C and no sig-nificant correlation is evidenced between sedimentological features, eruptive and depositional pro-cesses and the final Tdep. The <b>admixture</b> <b>of</b> ambient <b>air</b> during the run-out appears the most effective process to cool the {{temperature of}} the ash and gases of the PDC, and is therefore the main factor affecting the deposit temperature. Somma–Vesuvius {{is one of the most}} hazardous vol-canoes in the world, with more than 650 000 people living within 10 km of the summit crater. During the last 22 kyr of activity, several explosive erup-tions of large magnitude and intensity have occurred (Santacroce 1987; Cioni et al. 2008; Santacroce et al. 2008), which generated large-volume pyrocla-stic density currents (PDCs, Gurioli et al. 2010). PDCs are hot, gravity-driven currents of volcanic particles and gas that travel at velocities of tens to hundreds of metres per second (Druitt 1998; Branney & Kokelaar 2002; Sulpizio & Dellino 2008), often causing near-complete destruction of widespread areas (Tilling & Lipman 1993). The hazards they pose are related to their temperature, particle concentration, ballistic content, dynamic pressure and ability to inundate and bury the environment under thick deposits (Baxter et al...|$|R

This article considers the issue of physico-chemical compatibility <b>of</b> <b>admixtures</b> <b>of</b> drug solutions/suspensions in nebulizers. A search of databases, prescribing information and primary literature was conducted to locate literature concerning the physico-chemical compatibility of inhalation solutions/suspensions. This was supplemented by telephone interviews. <b>Admixtures</b> <b>of</b> albuterol with ipratropium and/or cromolyn, of albuterol and budesonide, or tobramycin, or colistin are physico-chemically compatible.

40|$|Variations in the isotopic {{composition}} (δ 13 C, δD) of methane produced within a landfill site near Mainz, Germany, were studied using a newly developed tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer (TDLAS) method. Additional {{data on the}} mixing ratios of CO 2, O 2, N 2, CH 4 itself and δ 13 C of the CO 2 in the landfill gas were also acquired. Samples taken from several branches of the landfill biogas collection system had methane {{isotopic composition}}s in the range δ 13 C = − 62. 3 to − 55. 3 %o VPDB (n = 23) and δD = − 327 to − 287 %o VSMOW (n = 23). Although the variability of the stable isotope ratios is small, several significant correlations were found between these and the other measured parameters, which {{provide insight into the}} microbiological processes occurring within the landfill. Several samples showed evidence <b>of</b> <b>admixture</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>air</b> which occurs when the pumping rate in the collection branch exceeds the local methane production rate. A fraction of the atmospheric oxygen is consumed during the passage through the landfill and CO 2 is produced in addition to the CO 2 associated with methanogenesis. The consumption of oxygen is correlated with the δ 13 C and δD of CH 4 and the δ 13 C of CO 2. The correlation is consistent with partial bacterial oxidation of CH 4 resulting in the progressive enrichment of the remaining CH 4 (α(δ 13 C) = 1. 008 ± 0. 003 and α(δD) = 1. 044 ± 0. 020) and in the formation of very depleted CO 2. For samples showing no evidence of oxidation, there was a negative correlation between δD and δ 13 C(CH 4) (r = − 0. 86, n = 14) and between δ 13 C(CO 2) and δ 13 C(CH 4) (r = − 0. 95, n = 14), which we interpret as originating from slightly varying contributions from the two methanogenic pathways CO 2 reduction and acetate fermentation...|$|R
