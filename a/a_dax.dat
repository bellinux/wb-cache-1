25|$|Lufthansa was a {{state-owned}} enterprise (and flag carrier) until 1994. Deutsche Lufthansa AG shares have been publicly traded on all German stock exchanges since 1966. In addition to floor trading, {{it is also}} traded electronically using the Xetra system. It is <b>a</b> <b>DAX</b> index share and is listed in the German Stock Exchange’s Prime Standard. In its annual report for 2016, Lufthansa reported that German investors held 68.6 per cent of the shares (previous year: 74.9 per cent). The second largest group, with 13.4 per cent, were shareholders from the USA. Investors from Luxembourg accounted for 4.2 per cent, followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland, with 2.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. This ensures continued {{compliance with the provisions}} of the German Aviation Compliance Documentation Act (LuftNaSiG). 54.5 per cent (previous year: 53.9 per cent) of the shares were held by institutional investors and 45.5 per cent (previous year: 46.1 per cent) by private individuals.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Landau {{has done}} {{intensive}} {{research into the}} ways in which children learn new words and specifically into the way that spatial information impacts this word learning. One aspect of focus has been on determining which aspects of appearance children value most in learning object names. Research has shown that shape is viewed as more important than size or texture in learning novel object names in both children and adults. [...] For instance, when people learn that a square object is <b>a</b> <b>Dax,</b> they do not view non-squares as Daxes but still consider squares of a different size or texture to be good examples of <b>a</b> <b>Dax.</b> This bias towards shape increases with age. In fact, it has been hypothesized that the bias develops as a way of learning words but begins to be used in general categorization tasks as children develop.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that young children and adults share a shape bias in learning novel object count nouns: they generalize the label to objects sharing the same shape as a standard but differing greatly in size or texture (Landau, Smith, & Jones, 1988). Three experiments tested the hypothesis that this shape bias is linked specifically to the acquisition of count nouns and therefore should be altered systematically by manipulating the form class of the novel word. Three-year-olds, five-year-olds, and adults were shown an object and taught a novel word in one of several different syntactic contexts and were asked to gen-eralize the word to objects varying from the standard in shape, size, or texture. In the count noun context, “This is <b>a</b> <b>dax,</b> ” all subjects showed the original shape bias even when the standard object’s texture was made extremely salient. In the superordinate context, “This is a kind of dax, ” 5 -year-olds and adults showed a weaker shape bias, broadening their acceptance of shape changes. In the adjective context, “This is a daxy one ” 5 -year-olds and adults narrowed their acceptance of texture changes and broadened acceptance of shape changes, as did 5 -year-olds in another adjective context, “This is <b>a</b> <b>dax</b> one. ” Three-year-olds showed similar patterns of differentiation over the kind of and adjective contexts, bu...|$|E

We analyse the historical tax regimes in Germany from 1990 until 2011, their implications for dividend taxation and thus DAX future prices. The regimes differ considerably in manner and magnitude of dividend taxation and hence allow to empirically derive a tax effect. We find a mispricing of the DAX future under the different tax regimes due to tax distortions. Previous literature has tried to find elaborated theoretical models incorporating tax effects on future prices but none of them has undertaken an extensive empirical evaluation of the tax effects over an extensive time period. Our analysis has implications for a correct DAX future valuation formula, the marginal investor in the futures market and its taxation as well as policy implications for the taxation of dividends...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe DAX 1 {{protein is}} an orphan nuclear hormone {{receptor}} based on sequence similarity in the putative ligand-binding domain (LBD). DAX 1 mutations result in X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC). Our {{objective was to}} identify DAX 1 mutations {{in a series of}} families, to determine the types of mutations resulting in AHC and to locate single–amino-acid changes in <b>a</b> <b>DAX</b> 1 structural model. The 14 new mutations identified among our 17 families with AHC brought the total number of families with AHC to 48 and the number of reported mutations to 42; 1 family showed gonadal mosaicism. These mutations included 23 frameshift, 12 nonsense, and six missense mutations and one single-codon deletion. We mapped the seven single–amino-acid changes to a homology model constructed by use of the three-dimensional crystal structures of the thyroid-hormone receptor and retinoid X receptor α. All single–amino-acid changes mapped to the C-terminal half of the DAX 1 protein, in the conserved hydrophobic core of the putative LBD, and none affected residues expected to interact directly with a ligand. We conclude that most genetic alterations in DAX 1 are frameshift or nonsense mutations and speculate that the codon deletion and missense mutations give insight into the structure and function of DAX 1...|$|E

Few data are available concerning testicular function and fertility in men with DAX 1 mutations. Azoospermia as well as failure of gonadotrophin treatment have been reported. We induced spermatogenesis in a patient who has <b>a</b> <b>DAX</b> 1 mutation (c. 1210 C>T), leading to a stop codon in position 404 (p. Gln 404 X). His endocrine testing revealed a low testosterone level at 1. 2 nmol/l (N: 12 – 40) with low FSH and LH levels at 2. 1 IU/l (N: 1 – 5 IU/l) and 0. 1 IU/l (N: 1 – 4 IU/l), respectively. Baseline semen analysis revealed azoospermia. Menotropin (Menopur®: 150 IU, three times weekly) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (1500 IU, twice weekly) were used. After 20 months of treatment, as azoospermia persisted, bilateral multiple site testicular biopsies were performed. Histology revealed severe hypospermatogenesis. Rare spermatozoa were extracted from the right posterior fragment and ICSI was performed.

40|$|DAX 1 is {{an unusual}} member of the orphan nuclear {{receptor}} family of transcription factors. Mutations in human DAX 1 cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita, while abnormal duplication of the gene is responsible for male-to-female dosage-sensitive sex reversal. Based on these and other observations, DAX 1 is thought {{to play a role}} in adrenal and gonadal development in mammals. As DAX 1 has not previously been described in any other vertebrate, a putative avian DAX 1 clone was isolated from an embryonic chicken (Gallus domesticus) urogenital ridge cDNA library. The expression profile of this cDNA was then examined during gonadogenesis. The clone included the conserved 3 � ligand-binding motif identified in humans and mice but the 5 � region lacked the repeat motif thought to specify a DNA-binding domain in mammals. Southern blot analysis and fluoresence in situ hybridisation mapping showed that the gene is autosomal, located on chromosome 1 q. Sequence comparisons showed that the putative chicken DAX 1 protein has 63 and 60 % identity with the human and mouse proteins respectively over the region of the conserved ligand-binding domain. However, stronger identity (74 %) exists with a putative alligator DAX 1 sequence over the same region. Northern blotting detected a single 1 · 4 kb transcript in late embryonic chicken gonads, while RNase protection assays revealed expression in the embryonic gonads of both sexes during the period of sexual differentiation.
