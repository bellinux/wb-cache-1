5|$|Hand {{was also}} a {{founding}} member of the American Law Institute, where he helped develop the influential Restatements of the Law serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields. One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality, for which reason the July–August 1955 issue of the Mattachine Society Review, the magazine of the country's first nationwide homosexual organization, published <b>a</b> <b>salute</b> to Judge Hand featuring his photograph on the cover.|$|E
5|$|On January 5, 1989, {{production}} {{began on}} {{a new version of}} Super Sloppy Double Dare from Philadelphia at WHYY-TV, continuing in syndication. The series premiered on January 22, 1989. The second half of the series was produced at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, with production beginning in April 1989. This version of the show recorded in larger studios with a larger set allowed for a lower level devoted to physical challenges and obstacles with a bigger size and, typically, bigger messes. Many episodes {{in this part of the}} series featured unique and offbeat themes that questions, challenges, and sometimes wardrobe would be patterned after. Themes included <b>a</b> <b>Salute</b> to Baseball, Backwards Day, Stupid Hat Day, <b>a</b> <b>Salute</b> to Breakfast, and two Super-Slop-a-Mania episodes featuring wrestlers and personalities from the World Wrestling Federation. Another special episode saw Summers and Harvey each team with a contestant to compete against each other, with Jim J. Bullock taking over hosting duties. By the end of Super Sloppy Double Dare, the program was syndicated to 154 stations. The series left syndication on September 8, 1989.|$|E

Oliver Cromwell visited Clifford's Tower in 1650, and received <b>a</b> <b>salute</b> from the guns stationed on top of it. The cost of the garrison was levied on the city of York.|$|E
5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd <b>a</b> <b>salute</b> following the fight, sending the fans into a frenzy and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E

5|$|All five forts {{and three}} battery positionsLeåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Södra Slumpbergetwere {{declared}} historic {{buildings in the}} summer of 1998 and are to be preserved for the future. The balloon hangar, the only of its kind in Sweden, was declared a historic building three years later in 2001. Two forts, Rödberget and Södra Åberget, are held in operation, and the former is used as a tourist attraction with guided tours, and there is also a possibility for companies to hold smaller conferences inside the fort. Over 10,000 visitors were expected to visit Rödberget Fort in 2002, averaging 300 a day during the summer. Boden Fortress is also still one of the salute batteries of Sweden, which fire a 21-gun salute at special occasions such as the National holiday of Sweden and birthdays of some members of the Swedish Royal Family. The fortress was made <b>a</b> <b>salute</b> battery on 2 June 1931, but since the forts have been decommissioned, the salute is now fired with four cannon located at Kvarnängen in central Boden.|$|E
5|$|Although Heber's episcopate {{had been}} brief {{he had made}} a {{considerable}} impression, and news of his death brought many tributes from around India. Sir Charles Grey, an old Oxford friend who was serving as Calcutta's Chief Justice, spoke of Heber's cheerfulness, his lack of self-importance, his good humour, patience and kindness. Flags were flown at half-mast in Madras and Calcutta, and the Governor-General ordered <b>a</b> <b>salute</b> of 42 guns—one for each completed year of the bishop's life. In several cities public subscriptions were opened to raise funds for monuments. In St John's church in Trichinopoly, initially a simple plaque above the grave recorded the date and place of Heber's death; this was in due course made much more elaborate. In St George's church, Madras, a large sculpture by Francis Chantrey was erected, depicting Heber ministering to members of his flock. Reflecting Heber's interest in the training of local ordinands, further funds were raised to provide Heber scholarships at Bishop's College; in Trichinopoly a school founded by the German missionary Christian Friedrich Schwarz became the Heber Memorial School.|$|E
5|$|In the Spanish {{armament}} of 1790, Seymour {{was called}} to service {{in command of the}} ship of the line HMS Canada, opening his commission with a cruise off the Isle of Wight. Passing through shallow water, Seymour ordered the use of a lead line to measure the depth ahead, but was accidentally struck in the head by the lead weight while soundings were being taken. Although little immediate damage seemed to have been caused, during the firing of <b>a</b> <b>salute</b> several days later Seymour suddenly suffered a severely adverse reaction and had to be taken ashore for emergency medical treatment. The head injury rendered him unable to endure any loud noises or bright lights and {{for the next three years}} he lived as an invalid at his country estate in Hambleton. By 1793 he was sufficiently recovered to return to service, and escorted Lord Hood to the Mediterranean in HMS Leviathan. There Hood led the occupation, defence and ultimate withdrawal from Toulon during the Republican siege of the city. Following the collapse of the city's defences, Seymour was sent back to England with dispatches but returned shortly afterward to convoy Leviathan back to Britain.|$|E
