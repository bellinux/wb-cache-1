5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incident, reports carried {{speculation}} by Cho's {{family members in}} South Korea that he was autistic. However, no known record exists of Cho ever being diagnosed with <b>autism,</b> nor could an <b>autism</b> diagnosis be verified with Cho's parents. The Virginia Tech Review Panel report dismissed an <b>autism</b> diagnosis and experts later doubted the <b>autism</b> claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} impact of thiomersal on <b>autism</b> has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause <b>autism.</b> For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of <b>autism.</b> In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and <b>autism,</b> and rates of <b>autism</b> have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as governmental {{agencies such as the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in <b>autism</b> or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to <b>autism.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Autism</b> has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of <b>autism</b> are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with <b>autism</b> through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autism</b> is a {{disorder}} of neural development characterized by {{impaired social interaction}} and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills. People with <b>autism</b> {{have been found to}} have strong visual processing skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autism</b> is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of <b>autism</b> has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with <b>autism,</b> mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view <b>autism</b> as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with <b>autism</b> have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with <b>autism</b> have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autism</b> {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. <b>Autism</b> affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, <b>autism</b> is included within the <b>autism</b> spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for <b>autism</b> or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E
5|$|Children with high-functioning <b>autism</b> {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} <b>autism</b> prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with <b>autism.</b> For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{had three}} children, Elizabeth, Martha Ann, and Daniel. Martha Ann died {{shortly after her}} birth. His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived {{most of his life}} at the Allegheny Valley School, an {{institution}} specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities. Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing <b>autism,</b> and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with <b>autism</b> and his efforts to better educate the public at large about <b>autism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help children with <b>autism</b> gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although {{there is no}} known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with <b>autism</b> live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing <b>autism</b> should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Fischbach {{joined the}} Simons Foundation as the {{scientific}} director {{to oversee the}} Simons Foundation <b>Autism</b> Research Initiative. The Simons Foundation is an organization founded by Jim Simons and his wife Marilyn, and has awarded $130 million for <b>autism</b> research as of 2008. As scientific director, Fischbach collaborates with mathematicians, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists to try and understand <b>autism</b> more completely. Currently, Fischbach oversees research focusing on the neurobiology of <b>autism</b> {{and how it can}} relate to finding a possible cure.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and <b>autism</b> or <b>autism</b> spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with <b>autism</b> likewise did not show an association between <b>autism</b> and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and <b>autism,</b> but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations of children to study {{the relationship between the}} use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and <b>autism</b> and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and <b>autism,</b> and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown <b>autism</b> rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and <b>autism</b> has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E
5|$|No single {{repetitive}} or self-injurious behavior {{seems to}} be specific to <b>autism,</b> but <b>autism</b> appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Pathlight School is {{a special}} school for high-functioning {{children}} with <b>autism,</b> located in Ang Mo Kio, Singapore. Founded in 2004, it {{is run by the}} non-profit <b>Autism</b> Resource Centre, and comprises one half of the national educational provision for autistic children. The school coaches students in social and life skills, teaches them mainstream curriculum subjects and prepares them for employment, in an <b>autism</b> friendly environment. With more than 500 pupils enrolled, the school has been noted for its achievements in special education in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Pathlight School {{is run by}} the <b>Autism</b> Resource Centre, a {{non-profit}} organisation that also offers early intervention, therapy and training for persons with <b>autism</b> in Singapore. The school employs 81 staff, including teachers, therapists and <b>autism</b> consultants, and the school board is headed by founder, ARC president and Member of Parliament Denise Phua. Operating costs of the school are paid by the Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service, while other costs, estimated at S$5 million per year, are funded through fees, donations, merchandise sales and fundraising events. Under the partnership between Pathlight School and Eden School, the two schools have a centralised admission system and share various resources; together, they form the national provision of education for children across the <b>autism</b> spectrum.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with <b>autism</b> do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with <b>autism</b> have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with <b>autism</b> are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with <b>autism</b> may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% {{of individuals}} with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with <b>autism,</b> and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate <b>autism</b> from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in <b>autism</b> proper.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autism</b> is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with <b>autism</b> reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with <b>autism</b> as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with <b>autism.</b> This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with <b>autism.</b> These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with <b>autism,</b> but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with <b>autism,</b> and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|Capaldi's actions {{received}} favourable {{coverage from}} the <b>Autism</b> Daily Newscast, an official Google News website reporting on current events and news {{of interest to}} those on the <b>autism</b> spectrum, with site journalist Jo Worgan noting that the actor had devoted himself while {{on the set of}} Doctor Who to spending time with an autistic girl who was a fan of the show. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the Time Lord character took time to support the mental well-being of a child in addition to his duties of protecting the universe from harm.|$|E
5|$|Frequency {{estimates}} vary enormously. In 2015 it {{was estimated}} that 37.2 million people globally are affected. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found <b>autism</b> rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of <b>autism</b> to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1; combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for <b>autism</b> of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000. Part of the variance in estimates arises from differences in diagnostic criteria. For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 criteria for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg criteria, 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four criteria. Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates of the sex ratio range from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria. Females with <b>autism</b> spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of <b>autism,</b> given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all <b>autism</b> spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than <b>autism.</b> There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E
5|$|His long {{acknowledged}} {{learning disability}} {{and a possible}} intellectual disability have both been linked to his severe epilepsy; recent speculation finds some behaviours consistent with <b>autism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it {{should be seen as}} distinct from high-functioning <b>autism</b> is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and there are questions about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the <b>autism</b> spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Winslet narrated the English {{version of}} an Icelandic {{documentary}} named A Mother's Courage: Talking Back to <b>Autism,</b> about Margret Ericsdottir whose child, Keli Thorsteinsson, suffers from non-verbal <b>autism.</b> Inspired by the story, she teamed with Ericsdottir in 2010 to form an NGO named the Golden Hat Foundation. The organisation aims to create <b>autism</b> awareness and was named after a poem written by Thorsteinsson. As the brand ambassador of the luxury brands Lancôme and Longines, Winslet partnered with these companies to raise awareness and funds for the foundation. She created a make-up collection for Lancôme in 2011, and in 2017, she designed a new watch for Longines.|$|E
5|$|In April 2017, Sesame Street {{introduced}} a new Muppet called Julia with <b>Autism</b> to the show.|$|E
5|$|In North America, a Canadian {{study of}} 27,749 {{children}} in Quebec showed that thiomersal {{was unrelated to}} the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). In fact, the study noted that rates of PDDs {{were higher in the}} birth cohorts with no thiomersal when compared to those with medium or high levels of exposure. A study performed in the US which analyzed data from 78,829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes, noting different results from data in different HMOs. A study performed in California found that removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not decrease the rates of <b>autism,</b> suggesting that thiomersal could not be the primary cause of <b>autism.</b> A study on children from Denmark, Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with <b>autism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} Austrian {{pediatrician}} Hans Asperger (1906–1980), Asperger syndrome {{is a relatively}} new diagnosis in the field of <b>autism.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2008, <b>Autism</b> United advocates {{gathered}} {{to announce that}} several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, {{in a move}} {{poking fun}} at Democratic presidential {{candidate}} John Edwards and building on the media coverage aimed at his campaign for the previously mentioned advertisement, Tancredo received a haircut for $400, which was used to donate money to the <b>Autism</b> Society of America. The haircut was given by David Holden of New Hampshire whose son is afflicted with <b>autism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused <b>autism.</b> The controversy began to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the public and gained widening support within certain elements in the <b>autism</b> advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject.|$|E
5|$|That {{same year}} he {{suffered}} his first epileptic seizure and {{showed signs of}} a disability, probably <b>autism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Autism</b> Act 2009 {{was passed}} to improve {{services}} {{and support for}} adults with <b>autism.</b> The Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was intended to improve the workplace rights of people working for employment agencies. The Equality Act 2010 required equal treatment in access to employment, private and public services. The Child Poverty Act 2010 set targets for governments to eliminate child poverty.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Sociological and cultural aspects of <b>autism</b> have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that <b>autism</b> is simply another way of being.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the <b>autism</b> spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader <b>autism</b> phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, <b>autism</b> is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with <b>autism</b> but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
