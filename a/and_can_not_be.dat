The rector serves for a term of 4 years before a new election is held, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> reelected in the following term. Zeferino Vaz was the first rector and held the position for 12 years until his mandatory retirement.|$|E

Bechtel is also entitled to appoint three Governors to the Executive Committee, including the Vice Chair.

The Executive Committee has a seventh Governor who is appointed by Battelle; they are non-voting and advisory to the Executive Committee.

25|$|It is from Plato’s {{caution that}} {{in the modern era}} many are aware of {{political}} and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In motion picture rating systems, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on {{a life of their own}} once in the public sphere, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> given a definitive or concrete meaning; as there will always be a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.|$|E
25|$|But on October 30, 2009, Justice Kornreich {{declined}} {{to approve a}} renew and re-argue of her July29 decision holding that SNG could change its club rules, but {{she said that the}} decision only dealt with Rules 49–54, and that everything else about rules changes was dicta (meaning that it was just discussion—not essential to the decision about Rules 49–54 <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used as precedent). Further, the court ordered the nomination of a panel of three independent experts who had sat on an America's Cup jury in the past in order to resolve certain outstanding issues. On the basis of the unanimous opinion of those three experts, on November19, 2009, judge Kornreich ruled that: (1) all ballast, whether moveable or not, must be included when measuring the Load Water Line; (2) it would be safe to hold the race in Valencia in February, (3) the Notice of Race and other rules could be issued as little as 16 days before the race, but the matter is moot because SNG had already published the Notice of Race; that Notice of Race could be modified by SNG but any modifications could be challenged by GGYC and would be reviewed by the jury; (4) the question of when the panel of jurors is customarily appointed is moot because the jury would soon be named; (5) the arrangements between ISAF and SNG regarding appointment of the jury appeared acceptable.|$|E

500|$|Roman conspiracy: John Antiochenus accuse Gallienus of the assassination. An {{interesting}} {{passage in}} the work of the Anonymus post Dionem speaks of a certain [...] "Rufinus" [...] who orchestrated the assassination on his own initiative then explained his act to the emperor who condoned the crime. This story talks about Rufinus ordering the murder of an older Odaenathus out of fear that he would rebel, and has the younger Odaenathus complaining to the emperor. Since the older Odaenathus (Odaenathus I) was proved to be a fictional character, the story was neglected by most scholars. However, according to Theodor Mommsen, younger Odaenathus is an oblique reference to Vaballathus; Rufinus should be identified with Cocceius Rufinus, the Roman governor of Arabia between 261/262. The evidence for a Roman conspiracy is very weak <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confirmed.|$|E
