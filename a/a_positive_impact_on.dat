40|$|This {{paper is}} to analyze {{the impact of a}} company’s {{technology}} selection on its innovation success and organizational performance. Technological capability enables a company to add value to products and processes, and its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> innovation success has been examined. Apart from technological capability, a company also needs technology management capability to manage technological resources effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model for implementation of technology selection, consisting of five elements: technology selection, technological capability, technology management capability, innovation success and organizational performance. The model is empirically tested using the data of 120 Chinese companies acquired by interviews and surveys. The results indicate that a company’s technology selection has no direct <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> innovation success; technology selection has <b>a</b> significant <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> technological capability and technology management capability, which, in turn, have <b>a</b> significant <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> innovation success; innovation success has <b>a</b> significant <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> organizational performance...|$|R
