40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a formal {{analysis}} approach {{to estimate the}} expected (average) data cache access time of an application across all possible program inputs. Towards this goal, we introduce the notion of probabilistic <b>access</b> <b>history</b> that intuitively summarizes the history of data memory accesses along different program paths (to reach a particular program point) and their associated probabilities. An efficient static program analysis technique has been developed to compute the <b>access</b> <b>history</b> at all program points. We estimate the cache hit/miss probabilities and hence the expected access time of each data memory reference from the <b>access</b> <b>history.</b> Our experimental evaluation confirms the accuracy and viability of the probabilistic data cache modeling approach.

40|$|The Particle Flow Analysis (PFA) is {{currently}} under intense studies {{as the most}} promising way to achieve precision jet energy measurements required at the future linear $e^+e^-$ collider. In order to optimize detector configurations and to tune up the PFA {{it is crucial to}} identify factors that limit the PFA performance and clarify the fundamental limits on the jet energy resolution that remain even with the perfect PFA and an infinitely granular calorimeter. This necessitates a tool to connect each calorimeter hit in particle showers to its parent charged track, if any, and eventually {{all the way back to}} its corresponding primary particle, while identifying possible interactions and decays along the way. In order to realize this with a realistic memory space, we have developed a set of C++ classes that facilitates <b>history</b> <b>keeping</b> of particle tracks within the framework of Geant 4. This software tool, hereafter called J 4 HistoryKeeper, comes in handy in particular when one needs to stop this <b>history</b> <b>keeping</b> for memory space economy at multiple geometrical boundaries beyond which a particle shower is expected to start.

Since {{little is known about the}} use and nature of grey literature in the humanities and specifically in the discipline of history, a systematic analysis was done to characterize the bibliographic references appearing in ten core history journals. Methods: references from all research articles published in ten core history journals in 2005 were analyzed – five printed and five Open <b>Access</b> <b>history</b> journals - to determine the portion of references from grey literature. The Open <b>Access</b> <b>history</b> journals are free available on the internet. The references were analyzed and categorized according to the type of publication. The uses of grey literature in printed versus Open Access versions were compared. It will be shown that grey literature as a primary source will be less important than in STM journals. Surprisingly the role of grey {{literature is}} of significance in Open <b>Access</b> <b>history</b> journals. The printed history journals show opposed results. Supplementary to grey literature is the development of the format of grey literature as aggregated historical datasets. These datasets are electronically available and will have an important influence on historical research if historians will get more confident in using these sources.

The information <b>access</b> <b>history</b> of a user is represented {{as a set of}} words, and {{is considered to be a}} user model. We weight words in a document according to their relevancy to the user model. The relevancy is measured by the biases of co-occurrence, called IRM (Interest Relevance Measure), between a word in a document and words in the user model. We evaluate IRM through a constructed browsing support system, which monitors word occurrences on the user’s browsed Web pages and highlights keywords in the current page. Our system consists of three components: a proxy server that monitors ac-cess to the Web, a frequency server that stores the frequencies of words appearing on the accessed Web pages, and a keyword extraction module. ...|$|R

40|$|Data {{prefetching}} is {{an effective}} way to bridge the increasing performance gap between processor and memory. As computing power is increasing much faster than memory performance, we suggest {{that it is time to}} have a dedicated cache to store data <b>access</b> <b>histories</b> and to serve prefetching to mask data access latency effectively. We thus propose a new cache structure, named Data <b>Access</b> <b>History</b> Cache (DAHC), and study its associated prefetching mechanisms. The DAHC behaves as a cache for recent reference information instead of as a traditional cache for instructions or data. Theoretically, it is capable of supporting many well known history-based prefetching algorithms, especially adaptive and aggressive approaches. We have carried out simulation experiments to validate DAHC design and DAHC-based data prefetching methodologies and to demonstrate performance gains. The DAHC provides a practical approach to reaping data prefetching benefits and its associated prefetching mechanisms are proven more effective than traditional approaches...|$|R

To detect data races precisely and efficiently during the execution of multithreaded programs, the epoch-based FastTrack technique has been employed. However, FastTrack has time and space complexities that depend on the maximum parallelism of the program to partially maintain expensive data structures, such as vector clocks. This paper presents an efficient algorithm, called iFT, that uses only the epochs of the <b>access</b> <b>histories.</b> Unlike FastTrack, our algorithm requires O(1) operations to maintain an <b>access</b> <b>history</b> and locate data races, without any switching between epochs and vector clocks. We implement this algorithm {{on top of the}} Pin binary instrumentation framework and compare it with other on-the-fly detection algorithms, including FastTrack, which uses a state-of-the-art happens-before analysis algorithm. Empirical results using the PARSEC benchmark show that iFT reduces the average runtime and memory overhead to 84 % and 37 %, respectively, of those of FastTrack...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an access control model that preserves the unlinkability of audit-logs in a distributed environment. The model restricts entities from accessing and correlating {{two or more}} audit-records belonging to different service invocations created by the same user. While the traditional Chinese Wall (CW) model is sufficient to enforce this type of unlinkability, in distributed environments CW is inefficient because the simple security condition semantics requires knowledge of a user’s <b>access</b> <b>history.</b> Our model allows specifications that are simple and efficient to enforce in a decentralized manner {{without the need for}} an <b>access</b> <b>history.</b> The proposed enforcement architecture allows users to negotiate unlinkability policies with the system. The system attaches automatically generated policy constraints to the audit-records. When these constraints are enforced appropriately, they implement unlinkability policies that are provably secure and precise for a fixed protection state. The model extends to a versioning scheme that adapts to evolving protection state, trading off precision to maintain the security of deployed policies. ...|$|R
