Noticing the {{impending}} gathering, Quaritch organizes a pre-emptive strike <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection to the Tree of Souls, to intercede {{on behalf of the}} Na'vi.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to other}} owls, the screech owl females {{are larger than}} the males of their species. They have a compact size and shape. The screech owls are small and agile. They are about 7 to 10 inches tall and have a {{wingspan}} of about 18 to 24 inches. They have prominent, wide-set feather tufts with bright yellow/green eyes. They have different brownish hues with whitish, patterned underside. This coloration helps them get camouflage <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> bark. They have well-developed raptorial claws and curved bill. They use them {{as a tool to}} tear their prey into pieces that are small enough for them to swallow. They tend to carry their prey to the nest and then eat it.|$|E

5000|$|... “...there were {{miles of}} forest {{to work through}} and trees to be cut down. The swift current drove the steamers (Army transports) <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and injured them so much that this plan had to be abandoned.” ...|$|R
60|$|The cannon were principally {{directed}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> blocking <b>the</b> road. Gradually {{these were}} torn to pieces and, after an hour's firing, were so far destroyed that a passage through them was comparatively easy. Then the enemy again began {{to cross the}} stream.|$|R
500|$|The {{scene is}} also {{referenced}} {{in the season}} fourteen episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIII", in which {{a large number of}} Homer's clones created in the episode fall down the gorge. [...] "Bart the Daredevil" [...] was once again referenced in The Simpsons Movie when Bart and Homer jump over Springfield Gorge on a motorcycle, and when they land on the other side, the ambulance from this episode {{can be seen in the}} background (still smashed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree).</b> It is also referenced in the Family Guy season thirteen episode [...] "The Simpsons Guy", where Homer and Peter Griffin fell down to Earth in Kang and Kodos' ship and jump the gorge during their fight.|$|E
500|$|Contrary to the plan, the Indians {{lying in}} wait near {{the rear of the}} column, {{apparently}} unable to contain themselves any longer, opened fire, taking the column completely by surprise. [...] Leading the 1st Regiment (Canajoharie district), Colonel Ebenezer Cox was shot off his horse and killed in the first volley. [...] Herkimer turned his horse to see the action, and was very shortly thereafter struck by a ball, which shattered his leg and killed the horse. [...] He was carried by several of his officers to a beech tree, where his men urged him to retire from further danger. He defiantly replied, [...] "I will face the enemy", and calmly sat leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> smoking a pipe and giving directions and words of encouragement to the men nearby.|$|E

[...] The elders tell Black Elk that they will bring him to meet [...] "Our Father, the two-legged chief" [...] and bring him {{to the center of}} a hoop where he sees the tree in full leaf and bloom and the [...] "chief" [...] standing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Coming out of his trance he hopes to see that the earthly tree has bloomed, but it is dead.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was like}} {{standing}} {{on top of}} a time bomb ... he was standing on the TD chassis, exposed to enemy fire from his ankles to his head and silhouetted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and <b>the</b> snow behind him. Eyewitness account of Pvt. Anthony V. Abramski ...|$|R
5000|$|Palazzo Venier dei Leoni's long low façade, made of Istrian {{stone and}} set off <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> in <b>the</b> garden behind that soften its lines, forms a welcome [...] "caesura" [...] in the stately march of Grand Canal palaces from the Accademia to the Salute.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{just at the}} top of the hill. We {{shall be}} there in less than a quarter of an hour." [...] The sailors had been warned to walk with the {{greatest}} caution, and especially to avoid striking any of their weapons <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{this day}} she was {{everything}} but a child's horse," [...] Chris broke in. [...] "She was a devil. She tried to scrape me off <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> and to batter my brains out <b>against</b> <b>the</b> limbs. She tried all the lowest and narrowest places she could find.

60|$|For several strenuous {{minutes they}} reeled, locked together, about the trail, and fell <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> while {{neither of them}} {{concerned}} himself greatly about the strict rules of the game.

6000|$|... "So {{they will}} be a month from now," [...] {{explained}} Old Mother Nature, smiling down at Whitefoot. [...] "That which you call fur will come off. He will rub it off <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> until his antlers are polished, {{and there is not}} a trace of it left. You see Lightfoot has just grown that set this summer." ...|$|R
50|$|One {{striking}} {{feature of}} Japan's snow country are the snow monsters (Juhyō) on Mount Zaō (Zaō-san). Strong wind over the nearby lake fling water droplets which freeze <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and their branches, until near-horizontal icicles begin to form. Falling snow settles {{on the ice}} formations, and {{the end result is}} a grotesque figure of a <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> effect of a full forest of such trees gives visitors a ghostly impression.|$|R
5000|$|A Chankiri Tree or Killing Tree was a <b>tree</b> in <b>the</b> Cambodian Killing Fields {{against which}} {{children}} and infants were smashed because {{their parents were}} accused of crimes <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Khmer Rouge. It was so the children [...] "wouldn't grow up and take revenge for their parents' deaths". Some of the soldiers laughed as they beat <b>the</b> children <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> Not to laugh could have indicated sympathy, making oneself a target.|$|R

60|$|Upon a great branch where Meriem often swung at {{indolent}} ease he saw Geeka propped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree's</b> great bole. What {{could it}} mean? Meriem had never left Geeka thus alone before. Korak {{picked up the}} doll and tucked it in his belt. He called again, more loudly; but no Meriem answered his summons. In the distance the jabbering of the excited Manus was growing less distinct.|$|R

50|$|Glade {{skiing is}} {{inherently}} {{more dangerous than}} skiing on trails and usually reserved for experts, though moderate glade terrain exists. Hazards such as cliffs or streams {{may or may not}} be blocked off by ski patrol. Other dangers include tree wells, logs, stumps, and <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> themselves. Equipment required includes a ski helmet, ski goggles, and gloves all to protect <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and underbrush. Glade riders need to be fit and agile to negotiate trees and hidden obstacles such as tree wells or concealed root systems.|$|R
6000|$|The scout and the Indians {{appeared}} {{to be familiar with}} the sequestered place where they now were; for, leaning their rifles <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> they commenced throwing aside the dried leaves, and opening the blue clay, out of which a clear and sparkling spring of bright, glancing water, quickly bubbled.

5000|$|The {{corpus of}} the dispute was a {{squirrel}}--a live squirrel supposed to be clinging {{to one side of}} a tree-trunk; while over <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree's</b> opposite side a human being was imagined to stand.

The resultant metaphysical problem now is this: DOES THE MAN GO ROUND THE SQUIRREL OR NOT? ...|$|R
