25|$|Earlier {{case reports}} on sudden death {{prompted}} {{a study on}} a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), <b>astemizole</b> (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap).

50|$|Bilastine binds to {{guinea-pig}} cerebellar histamine H1-receptors (Ki=44 nM) and {{to human}} recombinant histamine H1-receptors (Ki=64 nM) with an affinity {{comparable to that}} of <b>astemizole</b> and diphenhydramine, and superior than that of cetirizine by three-fold and fexofenadine by five-fold (Corcóstegui). In different murine models, bilastine by oral route, antagonizes the effects of histamine in a dose-dependent manner, with potency similar to that of cetirizine and between 5.5 and 10 times greater than that of fexofenadine.|$|E
50|$|Prolongation of the QT {{interval}} {{may be due}} to {{an adverse}} drug reaction. Many drugs such as haloperidol, vemurafenib, ziprasidone, methadone and sertindole can prolong the QT interval. Some antiarrhythmic drugs, like amiodarone or sotalol work by getting a pharmacological QT prolongation. Also, some second-generation antihistamines, such as <b>astemizole,</b> have this effect. In addition, high blood alcohol concentrations prolongs the QT interval. A possible interaction between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thiazide diuretics is associated with QT prolongation. Macrolide antibiotics are also suspected to prolong the QT interval, after it was discovered recently that azithromycin was associated with an increase in cardiovascular death.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, various {{researchers}} showed that grapefruit juice, and grapefruit in general, {{is a potent}} inhibitor of CYP3A4, which can affect the metabolism {{of a variety of}} drugs, increasing their bioavailability. In some cases, this can lead to a fatal interaction with drugs like <b>astemizole</b> or terfenadine. The effect of grapefruit juice with regard to drug absorption was originally discovered in 1989. The first published report on grapefruit drug interactions was in 1991 in the Lancet entitled [...] "Interactions of Citrus Juices with Felodipine and Nifedipine" [...] and was the first reported food-drug interaction clinically. The effects of grapefruit last from 3-7 days, with the greatest effects when juice is taken an hour previous to administration of the drug.|$|E
50|$|Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A. The {{activity of}} the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels {{and the potential for}} rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.Earlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. Proarrhythmic {{effects have}} been {{observed}} with the selective histamine 1 (H 1) receptor antagonist drug <b>astemizole,</b> a widely prescribed antihistamine. The metabolites of <b>astemizole</b> {{and those of other}} antihistamine compounds have not been implicated as causative agents of cardiac arrhythmias. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether desmethylastemizole, the principal metabolite of <b>astemizole,</b> blocks delayed rectifier potassium (K+) channels. Background. QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes are associated with <b>astemizole</b> intake and have been ascribed to block the repolarizing K+ currents, specifically the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier iKr. <b>Astemizole</b> undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, and its dominant metabolite, desmethylastemizole, has a markedly prolonged elimination time. We report the clinical observation of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in a patient with undetectable serum concentrations of <b>astemizole</b> (< 0. 5 ng/ml) and “therapeutic” concentrations of desmethylastemizole (up to 7. 7 ng/ml or 17. 3 nmol/liter). Methods. The perforated patch clamp recording technique was used to study the effects of desmethylastemizole (20 nmol/liter) on action potentials and iKr in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. Results. Desmethylastemizole produced action potential prolongation and the induction of plateau early afterdepolarizations. Under voltage clamp conditions, desmethylastemizole suppressed iKr amplitude by ≈ 65 %. The drug E- 4031 (100 nmol/liter), which selectively blocks iKr, had a similar effect on current amplitude. Conclusions. Desmethylastemizole, the major <b>astemizole</b> metabolite, blocks the repolarizing K+ current iKr with high affinity. The clinical observation of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes found with <b>astemizole</b> intake may principally be caused by the proarrhythmic effects of its metabolite desmethylastemizole...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} acute and chronic (3 months) dosing with <b>astemizole</b> on indocyanine green {{kinetics}} {{have been investigated}} in normal volunteers and patients. A single dose of <b>astemizole</b> 40 mg produced significant reduction in indocyanine green clearance (P less than 0. 02) and volume of distribution (P less than 0. 02) when assessed at 48 h, but not at 24 h. In six volunteers who did not receive <b>astemizole</b> {{there was no significant}} change in indocyanine green kinetics over a 48 h period. In seven patients on chronic treatment with <b>astemizole</b> there was no significant change in indocyanine green kinetics when these were measured at 1 month and 3 months and compared to pre-treatment values. The change in indocyanine green clearance and volume of distribution following acute <b>astemizole</b> treatment did not correlate with H 1 -receptor antagonism. Change in indocyanine green clearance following acute drug administration may not be due to changes in liver blood flow and should therefore be interpreted with caution...|$|E

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 4 F 12 is a drug-metabolizing {{enzyme that}} is {{primarily}} {{expressed in the}} liver, kidney, colon, small intestine, and heart. The properties of CYP 4 F 12 that may impart an increased catalytic selectivity (decreased promiscuity) were explored through in vitro metabolite elucidation, kinetic isotope effect experiments, and computational modeling of the CYP 4 F 12 active site. By using <b>astemizole</b> as a probe substrate for CYP 4 F 12 and CYP 3 A 4, {{it was observed that}} although CYP 4 F 12 favored <b>astemizole</b> O-demethylation as the primary route of metabolism, CYP 3 A 4 was capable of me-tabolizing <b>astemizole</b> at multiple sites on the molecule. Deuteration of <b>astemizole</b> at the site of O-demethylation resulted in an isotope effect of 7. 1 as well as an 8. 3 -fold decrease in the rate of clearance for <b>astemizole</b> by CYP 4 F 12. Conversely, although an isotope effect of 3. 8 was observed for the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite when deuterated <b>astemizole</b> was metabolized by CYP 3 A 4, there was no decrease in the clearance of <b>astemizole.</b> Development of a homology model of CYP 4 F 12 based on the crystal structure of cytochrome P 450 BM 3 predicted an active site volume for CYP 4 F 12 that was approximately 76 % of the active site volume of CYP 3 A 4. As predicted, multiple favorable binding orientations were available for <b>astemizole</b> docked into the active site of CYP 3 A 4, but only a single binding orientation with the site of O-demethylation oriented toward the heme was identified for CYP 4 F 12. Overall, it appears that although CYP 4 F 12 may be capable of binding similar ligands to other cytochrome P 450 enzymes such as CYP 3 A 4, the ability to achieve catalytically favorable orientations may be inherently more difficult because of the increased steric constraints of the CYP 4 F 12 active site...|$|E
