40|$|Redundancy in {{structures}} {{can provide}} {{load carrying capacity}} for the structure under multiple load cases, damaged conditions, or different configurations. Since these different load paths arise due to some changes in conditions, they are {{also referred to as}} “alternate paths”. The damage tolerance of a structure is a function of its ability to develop <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> paths that effectively transfer loads to support points. A robust multi-path structure should be able to develop multiple <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> paths that can survive loading and perform its intended function regardless of large variations in changes of loads, stiffness, or configuration. Previous work on design of redundant truss structures for robust damage tolerance and progressive failure response has shown that redundancy by itself does not guarantee that a structure can provide effective <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> paths. Redundant structures must be tailored explicitly to develop such <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> paths. This paper investigates design optimization methods for robust design of redundant multiple load path structures. Different mathematical definitions for load paths are presented and compared. Topology optimization for damage tolerance is developed to generate candidate designs for <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> path investigations.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of fatigue resistance {{is one of}} the main concerns in structural engineering, a concern that is particularly important in the evaluation of existing bridge members designed or erected before the development of fatigue design provisions. The ability of a structural member to develop <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> paths after the failure of a component is known as member-level or internal redundancy. In fastened built-up members, these <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> paths are affected by the combination of fastener pre-tension and friction between the structural member components in contact. In this study, a finite element methodology to model and analyze riveted and bolted built-up members was developed in ABAQUS and validated with experimental results. This methodology was used to created finite element models of three fastened plates subjected to tension, in which the middle plate had failed, in order to investigate the fundamental effects of combined fastener pre-tension and friction on their mechanical behavior. Detailed finite element models of riveted and bolted built-up flexural members were created and analyze to understand the effect of fastener pre-tension in member-level redundancy and resistance to fatigue and fracture. The obtained results showed that bolted members are able to re-distribute a larger portion of the load away from the failing component into the rest of the member than riveted members, and that this transfer of load also took place over a smaller length. Superior pre-tension of bolts, in comparison to rivets, results in larger frictional forces that develop at the contact interfaces between components and constitute additional <b>alternate</b> <b>load</b> paths that increase member-level redundancy which increase the fatigue and fracture resistance of the structural member during the failure of one of its components. Although fatigue and fracture potential may be mitigated by compressive stresses developing around the fastener hole due to fastener pre-tension, it was also observed, that at the surface of the fastener hole and at the contact interface with another plate, tensional stresses could develop; however, further computational and experimental work should be performed to verify this claim. ...|$|R

The combination of the effects of abrasive and adhesive wear, caused by relative surface sliding and resulting in surface damage, and fatigue, caused by <b>alternated</b> <b>loads</b> in presence of high local stress intensity factors (i. e surface degradation by wear), is called "fretting fatigue". A presence of oxidation phenomenon can also be part of the fretting fatigue process. In the case of the railway wheelsets designed after 2003, there are no records of failures at press-fits because the design rules are based on shape of the transitions (D/d ≥ 1. 2) that make the axle transition the most stressed point. However, it is important to analyze the acceptability of defects and micro-cracks at the press-fits in order to correctly interpret fatigue strength considering that micro-scars and micro-cracks are some times detected after fatigue tests for D/d = 1. 2. In this paper we analyse the full-scale test results obtained on EA 4 T axles within the Euraxles project on the basis of detailed FE analyses and a new criterion for prediction non-propagation of cracks under RCF conditions.
