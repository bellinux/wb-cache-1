2500|$|Because Rohan is {{intended}} to be a high-level region anyway, and because leveling in Lord of the Rings Online is accomplished primarily by questing rather than defeating enemies, the penalty for [...] "power-leveling" [...] and shared loot has been removed in Rohan. [...] Instead, every player who taps an enemy (or heals another player who has tapped an enemy) will get full experience and loot rewards when the enemy is defeated, even if other players help in defeating the enemy. [...] Players are free to engage an enemy without the risk of [...] "stealing" [...] someone else's experience reward or, conversely, having their experience [...] "stolen." [...] If a player finds him-/herself on the losing end of a fight with a warband, anyone else who witnesses the impending defeat can step in and assist with no penalty to either the assistee or the <b>assistor.</b> [...] This practice encourages players to help each other, whether they are grouped or not. The new tapping rules were initially only implemented in Rohan, but due to positive player feedback were expanded {{to the rest of the}} game world in an update later that year.|$|E

Statements regarding which <b>assistors</b> promoted their continuous participation along with demographic statements were included in the questionnaire; free response comments were requested as well. Statistical measurements of factor analysis, frequency response, Chi-Square, and Analysis of Variance were used. Compared to previous research (Quigley, 1997) that identified three categories of barriers, this research identified five categories of assistors: situational, institutional, dispositional, parental, and program specific. Parental <b>assistors,</b> as a group, were statistically significant more {{than any of the other}} <b>assistors</b> when measured according to the independent variables of participants' age, children's age, and enrollment level. Institutional and dispositional <b>assistors</b> were found statistically significant when measured according to the variable of participants' age.

40|$|Background: More American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN) {{reside in}} California {{than any other}} single state in the United States; Los Angeles is home to the largest number of AIAN in the country. In 1997 the federal {{government}} initiated the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP – called Healthy Families in CA). In 2000 federal regulations were amended to exempt AIAN children from any SCHIP cost sharing. Since the California waiver implementation date there has been no significant change in the rate of AIAN enrollment. Methods: This study examined the policy and implementation barriers for AIAN children to obtain Healthy Families coverage. The principal research methods focused on: (a) a review of administrative data; (b) the development of eligibility estimates of the AIAN population; and (c) key informant interviews with AIAN-health serving institutions, health care providers (including urban, rural, and non-Indian clinics), the Healthy Families administrative unit (MRMIB), Department of Health Services (DHS), and health insurance plans. Results: About 2, 200 Healthy Family recipients are currently identified as AIAN, and we estimate that over 7, 000 additional uninsured AIAN children in California are Healthy Families eligible. AIAN applicants using certified <b>assistors</b> {{are more likely to be}} approved for enrollment than those not using <b>assistors,</b> but one third of tho se using <b>assistors</b> are denied coverage. This research identified many barriers to AIAN enrollment including: diverse and inconsistent understandings of the waiver and eligibility requirements; insufficient training regarding the waiver; insufficient program awareness/outreach; and the additional application burden with requirement of tribal enrollment documentation. There will be a positive change in AIAN enrollment with parental eligibility and practical steps are presented that can be taken to improve the process/system. Conclusion: The California Legislature and MRMIB have made a series of program modifications that are designed to improve the coverage rate and total enrollment of Healthy Families. The AIAN population is a group with special implementation legislation that does not appear to have been reached adequately by those efforts; this research will assist policy makers in improving the coverage of AIAN children and families...|$|R

40|$|No law in any {{jurisdiction}} {{that permits}} physician assisted dying offers individuals a medically assisted death {{without the need}} to comply with certain criteria. The Netherlands is no exception. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} physicians are averse to providing an assisted death even when the Dutch ‘due care criteria’ have been met and the unbearable suffering requirement is especially difficult to satisfy. Some individuals with an enduring desire to die who do not meet the ‘due care’ criteria under the Dutch legislation turn to other means of achieving a self-appointed death. This paper explores two alternative methods of securing a self-determined death (an assisted death involving lay <b>assistors</b> or a self-hastened death by stopping eating and drinking), and raises the question of how far the law should recognise autonomy in the context of physician assisted death...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Despite efficiency gains from processing more tax returns electronically, adding website services, and shifting resources from enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was unable {{to keep up with}} demand for telephone and correspondence services. Access to IRS's telephone <b>assistors</b> remained at 68 percent from 2012. The percentage of overage paper correspondence (over 45 days old) increased to 47 percent from 40 percent in 2012. In the face of similar trends, last year GAO reported that a dramatic revision in IRS's taxpayer service strategy was needed and recommended IRS take steps to better balance demand for services with available resources. GAO acknowledged this may require IRS to consider difficult tradeoffs, such as limiting some services. In response, IRS has proposed eliminating or reducing some services for 2014 such as answering basic tax law questions only during the filing season. However, IRS officials told GAO the proposed cuts may not be sufficient to stop the deterioration in services. Until IRS develops a strategy, it risks not communicating expectations about the level of services it can provide based on the resources available. IRS could use the strategy to facilitate a discussion with Congress and other stakeholders about the appropriate mix of service, level of performance, and resources. ...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses (1) how well the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is providing service to taxpayers and ensuring compliance with tax laws, and (2) IRS' progress in its long-term effort to modernize. GAO found that IRS posted mixed results in 2001 in collecting revenues, providing taxpayer service, and enforcing tax laws. On the plus side, IRS processed millions of tax returns and issued refunds without significant problems, taxpayers had an easier time getting through to telephone <b>assistors,</b> and IRS said that it made progress in correcting weaknesses that threatened the security of electronically filed tax information. On the down side, the quality of service provided to taxpayers who visited taxpayer assistance centers, trends in audit rates and enforcement programs, and productivity all experienced troubling declines. With respect to modernization, IRS is making incremental progress in overhauling its organization, performance management system, business processes, and information technology. IRS is also making important progress in implementing its new organizational structure, developing a blueprint for modernizing its business processes and information systems, and more fully defining its strategic direction. However, IRS progress has fallen short of expectations. For example, IRS is not {{where it should be}} in implementing management controls over business systems modernization, which has contributed to project delays. ...|$|R

GAO found that although the 2001 filing season appears to be running smoothly, some matters require further attention. For example, IRS has had problems with the personal identification number assigned to electronic filers. Although data indicate that taxpayers are having an easier time reaching IRS to ask questions, concerns persist about the productivity of its telephone <b>assistors.</b> With respect to business systems modernization, GAO has long held that IRS needs to establish fundamental modernization management controls before it begins to build and implement modernized systems. IRS has made some progress in this area, but it is still not where it needs to be. GAO is concerned that IRS is allowing its system acquisition projects to get ahead of its capabilities for managing them. Lastly, GAO's review of IRS' electronic filing systems last year showed that IRS had ineffective controls to ensure the security of those systems and electronically-transmitted taxpayer data. IRS moved promptly to correct those access control weaknesses before this filing season began, according to IRS officials. It developed plans to improve security over its electronic filing systems and internal networks and said that it had substantially implemented those plans. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 directed the Treasury to issue advance 2001 tax refunds to individual taxpayers who filed a tax year 2000 return. As a result, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had to identify eligible taxpayers so that checks could be sent to these taxpayers by December 31, 2001. The Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service was to issue the checks on behalf of IRS, with the first checks to be received {{during the week of}} July 23, 2001. As of September 30, 2001, 84 million taxpayers were to have received $ 36 billion in advance tax funds. IRS offset about $ 2. 1 billion from these advance tax refunds to recover delinquent federal taxes. IRS spent $ 104 million to run the program through September 2001, which included IRS staffing costs as well as the costs associated with contracts, postage, and printing. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified two initial problems that affected either the accuracy or timeliness of the advance refund notices. One involved computer programming errors that resulted in 523, 000 taxpayers receiving notices indicating that they would receive larger advance tax refunds than they were entitled to receive. The IG also determined that 5. 3 million taxpayers who had filled their tax returns by the April 16 filing deadline would have delays of up to nine weeks in receiving their advance refund notices. Two problems that continued throughout the advance tax refund period involved (1) undeliverable refund notices and checks due to incorrect addresses and (2) taxpayer difficulties in reaching IRS telephone <b>assistors.</b> Another problem that was quickly identified and corrected during {{the early stages of the}} advance tax refund period involved duplicate checks sent to about 25 taxpayers. ...|$|R

The study used the response data obtained by the survivor accounts (Blake et al. 2004) and {{the population of the}} building is derived from the formal investigation made by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Averill et al. 2005). The model results suggested that the impact of fire-fighters entering the building on the overall evacuation efficiency was minimal. Different hypothetical scenarios were also simulated, permitting to draw conclusions on, (1) the importance of having dispersed staircases within buildings, (2) the importance of having a balanced distribution of occupants in the staircases in the case of high-rise building evacuations, (3) the change in evacuation efficiency in high-rise buildings (the average floor evacuation efficiency decreases with height). The simulation work also highlighted three fundamental components of high-rise building evacuations that are not currently fully represented in evacuation models, namely (1) the impact of fatigue, (2) the impact of group dynamics and (3) the impact on evacuation dynamics of disabled people. The importance of the behaviours of this type of occupants in the WTC and the subsequent effects on the evacuation process has been fully discussed by Shields et al. (2009). Evacuation models need {{to take into account the}} possible simulation of not only mixed-population but also the global impact they may have on the evacuation process, e.g., their need for assistance, the formation of emerging groups with their <b>assistors</b> or others, etc. Johnson (2005) performed a study when he reviewed existing computer models with a critical point of view deriving from the WTC evacuation. He pointed out several aspects that need to be addressed in evacuation models, such as (1) the impact of the ingress/egress of emergency personnel, (2) the representation of more complex group dynamics, and (3) the impact of building information and management systems on the evacuees’ ability to evacuate.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Preparing for the tax filing season is a significant undertaking for Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The filing season is when most individuals file their tax returns, receive refunds, and contact IRS if they have questions. As returns are received, IRS begins a series of automated compliance checks to correct errors on tax returns and ensure that refunds are justified. For example, IRS rejects electronically filed returns with basic errors requiring taxpayers to correct and resubmit them. It uses what is called "math error authority" to automatically correct obvious noncompliance such as violations of limits on deductions or credits, which allows IRS to avoid costly audits. IRS must begin preparing for each filing season months in advance and preparations include the following. (1) Revising tax forms and publications to implement tax law changes. Recent major law changes that affected the 2009 filing season include the (a) Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which contained the recovery rebate credit allowing taxpayers who did not receive the full economic stimulus payment last year to claim {{some or all of}} the unpaid credit on their 2008 returns; (b) Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Housing Act), which included a first-time homebuyer credit of up to $ 7, 500; and (c) American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), which increased the maximum credit to $ 8, 000 and eliminated the payback provision of the first-time homebuyer credit for homes purchased before December 1, 2009. (2) Reprogramming and testing computer systems to incorporate tax law changes. (3) Hiring and training telephone <b>assistors,</b> many of whom are temporary hires employed for the filing season. (3) Coordinating with the paid preparer and tax software industries, which serve as important intermediaries between IRS and taxpayers and prepare close to 90 percent of all returns and all electronically filed returns. IRS also coordinates with a network of volunteer tax return preparers who help elderly individuals and others prepare their tax returns at over 12, 000 volunteer sites. Because of the magnitude and importance of the filing season, you requested that we review IRS's 2009 filing season performance. ...|$|R
