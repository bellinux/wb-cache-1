5|$|Every song in {{the album}} is {{available}} either as <b>A</b> <b>or</b> <b>B</b> sides of single releases both in seven or twelve inch format. Seven of the songs out of ten saw US release either as <b>A</b> <b>or</b> <b>B</b> side and UK had the remaining three songs available also as <b>A</b> <b>or</b> <b>B</b> sides of singles. As of 2000 the singles are available in both 7 and 12 inch formats and few different mixes, even though some releases have been more targeted to UK/Europe audience. The original album mix of the title track is not available as a single and the original mix was kept for future reissues of the album, unlike the two songs mentioned in the upper note, The single mix did not replace the title track on all future reissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{approximation}} becomes exact {{in a kind}} {{of infinite}} limit; if either <b>a</b> <b>or</b> <b>b</b> is an infinite cardinal number, their cardinal sum is exactly equal to the greater of the two. Accordingly, there is no subtraction operation for infinite cardinals.|$|E
5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property does not imply that <b>a</b> <b>or</b> <b>b</b> are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E

The {{difference}} arises because money can’t be destroyed in the way that slaves can be, so a stipulation for slave <b>an</b> <b>or</b> <b>b</b> is fundamentally different from one for a because in the first instance if a dies, the stipulation would be valid for b, whereas in the second, there would be no contract.|$|R

5|$|NGC 7424 is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet. Approximately 37.5 million light years distant, it is about 100,000 light years in diameter, has well defined spiral arms and is thought to resemble the Milky Way. Two ultraluminous X-ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC 7424. SN 2001ig was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova, one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its spectrum, but this emission later became undetectable {{and was replaced by}} lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a Type Ib supernova. A massive star of spectral type F, <b>A</b> <b>or</b> <b>B</b> is thought to be the surviving binary companion to SN 2001ig, which was believed to have been a Wolf–Rayet star.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face a long wait on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section {{was in the middle}} of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); one of only a few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type <b>A</b> <b>or</b> <b>B</b> staff.|$|E
5|$|In biochemistry, {{heavy metals}} are {{sometimes}} defined—on {{the basis of}} the Lewis acid (electronic pair acceptor) behaviour of their ions in aqueous solution—as class B and borderline metals. In this scheme, class A metal ions prefer oxygen donors; class B ions prefer nitrogen or sulfur donors; and borderline or ambivalent ions show either class <b>A</b> <b>or</b> <b>B</b> characteristics, depending on the circumstances. Class A metals, which tend to have low electronegativity and form bonds with large ionic character, are the alkali and alkaline earths, aluminium, the group 3 metals, and the lanthanides and actinides. Class B metals, which tend to have higher electronegativity and form bonds with considerable covalent character, are mainly the heavier transition and post-transition metals. Borderline metals largely comprise the lighter transition and post-transition metals (plus arsenic and antimony). The distinction between the class A metals and the other two categories is sharp. A frequently cited proposal to use these classification categories instead of the more evocative name heavy metal has not been widely adopted.|$|E

40|$|Improved serum-free {{media were}} {{developed}} for the anchorage-dependent growth of A 549 human lung carcinoma and B 16 mouse melanoma cell lines in vitro. Type 1 transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) inhibited the growth of <b>A</b> 549 <b>or</b> <b>B</b> 16 cells under serum-free conditions or {{in the presence of}} 10 % serum by 15 - 33 %. In contrast, in the presence of micrograms/ml concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), picomolar concentrations of TGF-beta 1 irreversibly inhibited the serum-free growth of <b>A</b> 549 <b>or</b> <b>B</b> 16 cells by 90 - 100 %. The PUFAs alone had little effect on cell growth. Cell growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 was not potentiated by saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, or prostaglandins. Inhibition of <b>A</b> 549 <b>or</b> <b>B</b> 16 cell growth by TGF-beta 1 in the presence of PUFAs was almost completely reversed by the antioxidant vitamin E, suggesting a role for lipid peroxidation in this process. Inhibition of <b>A</b> 549 <b>or</b> <b>B</b> 16 cell growth by TGF-beta 1 in the presence of 5 % fetal calf serum was also potentiated by PUFAs and partially reversed by antioxidants. The presence of retinoic acid was required for maximal PUFA-dependent growth inhibition of <b>A</b> 549 <b>or</b> <b>B</b> 16 cells by TGF-beta 1 under some, but not all, conditions. These results suggest that inhibition of carcinoma and melanoma cell growth by TGF-beta 1 is mediated, in large part, by PUFAs...|$|R
