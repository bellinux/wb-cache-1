5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an <b>atavism.</b> From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E

[...] "Atavisms are the reappearance of a lost character typical of remote ancestors and not seen in the parents or recent ancestors..." [...] and are an [...] "indication of the developmental plasticity that exists within embryos..." [...] <b>Atavisms</b> occur because genes for previously existing phenotypical features are often preserved in DNA, even though the genes are not expressed in some or most of the organisms possessing them.

25|$|A {{number of}} authors have {{questioned}} the assumption that cancers result from sequential random mutations as oversimplistic, suggesting instead that cancer results from {{a failure of the}} body to inhibit an innate, programmed proliferative tendency. A related theory developed by astrobiologists suggests that cancer is an <b>atavism,</b> an evolutionary throwback to an earlier form of multicellular life. The genes responsible for uncontrolled cell growth and cooperation between cancer cells are very similar to those that enabled the first multicellular life forms to group together and flourish. These genes still exist within the genome of more complex metazoans, such as humans, although more recently evolved genes keep them in check. When the newer controlling genes fail for whatever reason, the cell can revert to its more primitive programming and reproduce out of control. The theory is an alternative to the notion that cancers begin with rogue cells that undergo evolution within the body. Instead they possess a fixed number of primitive genes that are progressively activated, giving them finite variability. Another evolutionary theory puts the roots of cancer back to the origin of the eukarote (nucleated) cell by massive horizontal gene transfer, when the genomes of infecting viruses were cleaved (and thereby attenuated) by the host, but their fragments integrated into the host genome as immune protection. Cancer now originates when a rare somatic mutation recombines such fragments into a functional driver of cell proliferation.|$|E

500|$|Heilmann, though {{excited about}} Beebe's idea, found little {{evidence}} for these leg-wings when studying the nestlings in the Zoological Museum collection in Copenhagen. He also examined the nestlings of more basal bird species, {{such as the}} ostrich and the emu, searching for a trace of leg-wings there, again without success. Even after studying the nestlings of birds closely related to Beebe's doves, including pigeons, he still found no trace of leg-wings. Instead he found on the nestlings' thighs [...] "a series of permanent feathers, and no <b>atavism.</b> If it were a genuine relic from such a very remote past, it would make its appearance, like a glimpse, in the embryo or squab, quickly to vanish again." [...] Heilmann went on to outline the morphological difficulties involved in such a leg-wing, indicating that it could hinder survival. In effect, Beebe's Tetrapteryx theory was completely disregarded by Heilmann, and this remained the consensus in ornithological literature until much later. Despite this, Heilmann's Proavis illustrations sport a short border of feathers behind the thigh, which some authors have suggested was inspired by Beebe's Tetrapteryx idea.|$|E

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} skeleton is {{a plastic}} organ {{system and the}} skeleton of teleosts is no exception. Epigenetic factors during development influence skeletal anatomy, mechanical properties, and meristic characters. The adult teleost skeleton undergoes changes connected to mechanical adaptation, repair, mineral homeostasis, sexual maturation, and aging. Vestiges, rudiments, <b>atavisms,</b> hyperostotic bones, additional tooth rows, and variable numbers of vertebral bodies are prominent examples of variable characters. Morphological changes require changes of skeletal structures on the cellular level, including modulation, transdifferentiation, and remodelling. Alterations at the cellular level are best understood by acknowledging those characters that distinguish teleost skeletons from mammalian skeletons: (a) the absence of osteocytes in most species of teleosts; (b) abundant mononucleated osteoclasts that perform non-lacunar bone resorption; (c) a phosphorous-rather than a calcium-driven mineral homeostasis; and (d) a variety of tissue types intermediate between bone and cartilage. This brief account of teleost skeletal plasticity shows that the teleost skeleton is a lifelong plastic organ system. Using examples, also from our own studies, we provide examples of skeletal plasticity at various hierarchical levels...|$|R

2500|$|Narcolepsy may {{represent}} an evolutionary <b>atavism.</b> According to a hypothesis REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, {{also known as}} animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as {{the last line of}} defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal: the animal appears dead (cf. [...] "playing possum"). The neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep, a fact which betrays a potential evolutionary kinship. For example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, sympathetic activation, and thermoregulatory changes. This hypothesis, which integrates many research findings into a unified and evolutionarily well informed framework, also sheds light on the phenomenon of narcolepsy.|$|E

Subfamilies are tentatively sorted in a phylogenetic sequence, from the most basal to the most advanced.

However, it now seems that the Larentiinae are actually older, as indicated by their numerous plesiomorphies and DNA sequence data. They are either an extremely basal lineage of the Geometridae [...] together with the Sterrhinae , or might even be considered a separate family of Geometroidea. As regards the Archiearinae, some species that were traditionally placed therein actually seem to belong to other subfamilies; altogether it seems that in a few cases, the prolegs which were originally lost in the ancestral geometer moths re-evolved as an <b>atavism.</b>|$|E

The home of mysterious Asiatic peoples, Sadoveanu's Scythia is notably the background to his novels Uvar and Nopțile de Sânziene. The former shows its eponymous character, a Yakut, exposed to the scrutiny of a Russian officer. In the latter, titled after the ancestral celebration of Sânziene during the month of June, shows a French intellectual meeting a nomadic tribe of Moldavian Rom people, who, the reader learns, are actually the descendants of Pechenegs. Călinescu notes that, in such writings, [...] "the intrigue is a pretext", again serving to depict the vast wilderness confronted with the keen eye of foreign observers. He sees Nopțile de Sânziene as [...] "the novel of millenarian immobility", and its theme as one of mythological proportions.

40|$|International audienceHomeosis is a {{developmental}} abnormality {{corresponding to the}} transformation of {{a part of the}} body into another one. This term was introduced in 1894 by William Bateson, who aimed to make an inventory of all kinds of biological variation in order to understand how evolution proceeds. But, immediately afterwards experimental embryology, or Entwicklungsmechanik in Germany, adopted and redefined this term to refer to abnormal regenerations in which the newly developed organ was not identical to the initial one but rather resembled another part of the body. At that time, many experimental embryologists, such as Wilhelm Roux, were calling for the elimination of any phylogenetic explanation of development and were attempting to promote more mechanistic, proximate explanations. Despite these recommendations, several biologists continued to account for developmental processes by turning to phylogeny instead of mechanical forces. The case of homeosis is representative. Indeed, abnormal regenerations were often seen as examples of <b>atavisms,</b> or recurrence of ancestral characteristics, and many embryologists appealed to Ernst Haeckel's 'fundamental biogenetic law' to explain these strange phenomena. The break between Haeckelian tradition and Entwicklungsmechanik is thus less radical than often assumed, and the homeosis concept represents one of the factors of this continuity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the author shows the {{importance}} of finding an optimal model for transforming social into private ownership.

This is probably {{the reason for the}} wandering and differences in the approach to each of the basic categories of ownership transformation. The author considers that two categories are the most important: time, i. e. the speed of transformation, because the optimal shortening of any and anyone’s time is one of the basic conditions for successful transformation; the second category that the author considers very important is to ensure a permanent income of entrepreneurial capital. The main goal of transformation — forming a creative, healthy and efficient enterprise, will be fulfilled after four fundamental problems of existing and future enterprises are solved: the quick transformation of quasi-shareholding capital into shareholding capital, the chronic overindebtedness of enterprises, acquiring and creating new capital and efficient management, supervision and control...|$|R

[...] One feels spiritually connected to Theodorescu-Sion, because one finds, buried into his pastures, the labor and suffering of a race that has produced the painter himself." [...] According to Anca Gogîltan, the Tinerimea art show of 1910 was a watershed moment in the relationship between urban modern art and the rural majority of Romania, as both Theodorescu-Sion and Camil Ressu tackled rural life without idyllic conventionalism or moral indignation. She refers in particular to Sion's Transylvanian-themed Arat în Munții Abrudului ("Ploughing in the Mountains of Abrud"), [...] "underlining man's civilizing action" [...] rather than expressing [...] "social critique". Prior to World War I, Gogîltan argues, Sion and Ressu were the visual partners of Romanian agrarianism (or Poporanism), seeking to emphasize, like Mihail Sadoveanu in the literary field, the [...] "dignity", [...] "resilience" [...] and economic importance of the Romanian peasantry.|$|E

They found themselves better off in their idle old days under the new regime, enjoying vastly more pleasure and comforts than they had in their busy and toilsome youth under the old regime.

40|$|Darwinulidae is {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} few metazoan taxa in which fully asexual reproduction might have persisted for millions of years. Although rare males in a single darwinulid species have recently been found, they may be non-functional <b>atavisms.</b> The representatives of this family are characterized by a slow evolutionary rate, resulting in a conservative morphology in the different lineages over long time frames and across wide geographic ranges. Differences between species and genera, although often based on small details of valve morphology and chaetotaxy, are nevertheless well-recognizable. Five recent genera (Darwinula, Alicenula, Vestalenula, Penthesilenula and Microdarwinula) and about 35 living species, including also those left in open nomenclature, are included in this family. Previous phylogenetic analyses using both morphological characters and molecular data confirmed that the five genera are good phyletic units. Here, we report on the results of a study on darwinulid ostracods from Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). The taxonomic investigation led to the description of a new genus and two new species, namely Isabenula humphreysi gen. nov. sp. nov. and Vestalenula sp.

A key to the genera of Recent Darwinulidae, based on the morphology of valves and soft parts in adult females, is also provided. The discovery of Isabenula gen. nov., which shares intermediate morphological features with the genera Vestalenula and Penthesilenul, opens new opportunities to critically reconsider previous hypotheses on tempo and mode of evolution in the family Darwinulidae and on the phylogenetic relationships between its representatives...|$|R

Apart from just ‘publishing’ texts in a strict sense, social media, blogs and platforms also hold a lot of catalyst potential especially regarding reflective communication, which is barely made use of due to the stigma of poor quality. The printed book, on the other hand, remains among the indispensable criteria to gain a tenured position. “Researching” and “writing (documenting the results) “ appear as separate stages in the sciences, but are closely interlocked in the humanities – so the geneses of texts may indeed differ to a degree rendering those processes incomparable.

Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, and Genesis P-Orridge. It draws upon Third Culture sciences and conceptual worldviews for Social Engineering, Values Systems Alignment, and Culture Jamming purposes. An important example of macro-historical memetic engineering analysis explaining how , patriarchy, war and violence are culturally programmed is Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade (San Francisco: Harper SanFrancisco, 1988), which outlines her Dominator and Partnership Culture thesis. The savvy memetic engineer {{is able to}} isolate, study, and subtly manipulate the underlying values systems, symbolic balance and primal <b>atavisms</b> that unconsciously influence the individual psyche and collective identity. A highly educated but susceptible intelligentsia, worldwide travel, and information vectors like the Internet, cable television, and tabloid media, means that hysterical epidemics and disinformation campaigns may become more common. This warfare will be conducted using aesthetics, symbols, and doctrines as camouflage that will ultimately influence our cultural meme pool. These contemporary life conditions (Historic Times; Geographic Place; Existential Problems; and Societal Circumstances) are explored in books like Carl Sagan's The Demon Haunted World: Science As a Candle in the Dark (New York: Ballantine Books, 1996), John Brockman's The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution (New York: Touchstone Books, 1996), and Michael Shermer's Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudo-science, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time (New York: W.H.

5000|$|Since first {{establishing}} what {{he refers}} to as his philosophical construction yard (chantier) to explore the écart between Chinese and European thought François Jullien has been organizing a vis-à-vis between cultures, rather than comparing them, so as to map out a common field for reflection. His work has led him to examine such various disciplines as ethics, aesthetics, strategy, and the systems of thought (pensées) of both History and nature. The aim of this [...] "deconstruction" [...] from without (du déhors) is to detect buried biases, in both cultures, as well as to elucidate the unthought-of (l'impensé) in our thought. It serves also to bring out the resources (ressources) or fecundities (fécondités) of languages and cultures, rather than consider them from the perspective of their [...] "difference" [...] or [...] "identity." [...] Moreover, it launches philosophy anew by extricating it from the bog of its <b>atavisms</b> and purging it of facile notions (évidences).The enterprise has not failed to raise hackles in both philosophical and Orientalist circles. Jullien has argued in response that the way to produce the common (produire du commun) is to put écarts to work. Because they establish distance, écarts bring out [...] "the between" [...] ("l'entre") and put our reflection into tension. [...] "The similar" [...] ("le semblable"), on the other hand, produces only what is uniform, which we then mistake for [...] "universals."Within this construction yard between the languages and systems of thought of China and Europe, Jullien has since developed a philosophy of [...] "living" [...] (philosophie du [...] "vivre"). This marks a departure from Being, the major bias of Greek philosophy. The result is a general philosophy that unfolds (se déploie) as a philosophy of existence. Some of Jullien's recent developments in this area include reflections on intimacy ("l'intime") and [...] "landscape" [...] ("paysage").For a survey of Jullien's work, see De l'Être au vivre, lexique euro-chinois de la pensée, Gallimard, 2015.The readership for Jullien's work has been expanding of late beyond the disciplines of Orientalism and philosophy.The world of management has begun to adopt such concepts as situational potential (potentiel de situation), as opposed to [...] "plans of action"; maturation (of conditions), as opposed to projected modelizations; and the initiation of silent transformations ("transformations silencieuses"), to induce change rather than impose it.Cf. A Treatise on Efficacy, 2004; Conférence sur l'efficacité, 2005.The world of psychology and analysis has begun to adopt the concept of [...] "silent transformation" [...] (cf. The Silent Transformations, 2011); the distinction between the word and speech (cf. Si parler va sans dire, 2006); and the concepts of the allusive (l'allusif), availability (la disponibilité), indirectness (le biais), and obliquity (l'obliquité) (cf. Cinq concepts proposés à la psychanalyse, 2012).The art world has begun to adopt the concepts of silent transformation; of the [...] "great image" [...] ("The great image has no form"); of soaring (l'essor) and slackness (l'étale) (slackness is what is determined, what has completely come to pass, and has therefore lost its effect; soaring is the upstream of the effect, when the effect is still occurring, still at work, and has not yet gone slack); of the frontal and the oblique (evocation, being oblique, might be preferable to representation, which is frontal: [...] "paint the clouds so as to evoke the moon"); of coherence, as opposed to sense (if a work does not deliver a [...] "sense," [...] then is it not co-herence that confers the work's con-sistency, that makes it [...] "hold together" [...] as a work?); of the evasive, as opposed to the assignable); of the allusive, as opposed to the symbolic. The art world has also begun to adopt the concepts of the écart and the between (l'entre). Because it is based on distinction, difference specifies an essence and stores it away as knowledge. An écart, however, establishes a distance and thus maintains a tension between the things it separates. Even while producing its disturbance, the écart brings forth a between, precisely because of the distance established. If the [...] "between" [...] is the thing of which ontology cannot conceive—because it has no in-itself: i.e., no essence—it is also the space through which thing passes, or occurs: the space of the operatory and the effective.Cf.
