5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the law's passage, polling {{indicated}} the public's views became increasingly negative {{in reaction to}} specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010. Polling statistics showed a general negative opinion of the law; with those in favor at approximately 40% and those against at 51%, as of October 2013. About 29% of whites approve of the law, compared with 61% of Hispanics and 91% of African Americans. Opinions were divided by age of the person at the law's inception, with a solid majority of seniors opposing the bill <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> majority of those younger than forty years old in favor.|$|E

5|$|The 1953–54 {{season was}} Port Vale's 42nd season of {{football}} in the Football League, and their fifth season {{overall in the}} Third Division North. Freddie Steele's side were crowned Third Division North champions with 69 points {{out of a possible}} 92, eleven points ahead of their nearest rivals. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, and would be denied an appearance in the final due to a controversial goal from a dubious penalty. These achievements were based upon a record-breaking 'Iron Curtain' defence, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> squad of nineteen players, most of whom had taken the club to second in the league the previous season.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{off-season}} {{began with}} a trade for Alex Tanguay, formerly of the Colorado Avalanche, and with Sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant Jim Playfair so he could focus on his duties as general manager. Despite a marked improvement in team offence <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> 96-point season, it was only good enough for eighth place in a Western Conference where seven teams cracked the 100-point barrier. In the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Red Wings in the first round. During the series, the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick-related penalties in the fifth game. Notably, backup goaltender Jamie McLennan was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward Johan Franzen. Franzen would score the series clinching goal in the Game 6 defeat in Double Overtime.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E

40|$|A plasma {{polymerisation}} {{process for}} creating highly hydrophobic polymer films comprises grafting chemical groups {{with a low}} affinity to oxygen to monomers and using plasma to carry out polymerisation with little change to their structure.
