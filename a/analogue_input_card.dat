40|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} and survey vessels are fitted with shipborne wave records (SBWRs) which operate reliably with minimal servicing. In the past, the wave data have normally been logged as a time series, using central ship's computing facilities, or recorded by a simple chart recorder. This resulted in unacceptable post-processing delays and costs. This document describes an automatic logging/processing system which was installed and operated sucessfully {{for a number of}} years on OWS Cumulus, requiring manual intervention only at monthly intervals to download the processed data files. The system uses a dedicated personal computer, with <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> <b>card,</b> to acquire and spectrally analyse the wave amplitude signal and to save the spectral data on hard disk.

40|$|The former Research Institute for Sustainable Energy (RISE) testing {{laboratory}} was originally a facility for measuring, monitoring and testing {{a variety of}} renewable energy systems. The RISE facility was independent of the School of Engineering and Energy, but has recently {{been taken over by}} the School as the Engineering and Energy Laboratory. Many of the systems associated with the laboratory have not been operated {{for a number of years}} and the condition of these systems, and the equipment that is associated with them, is not known. Personnel involved with the former RISE facility have since left Murdoch taking with them their knowledge of the facility. This project was primarily concerned with re-commissioning these systems and developing an operational knowledge of the SCADA based control system. Areas to be covered in particular were: •	connections to the grid from PV arrays and wind turbines •	PLC system and software •	inverters, solar array simulator, environmental chamber and other peripheral equipment •	power supplies such as the diesel generator, motor generator set and battery banks •	 3 phase permanently connected power monitors •	AC and DC electrical systems Initial inspections of the electrical systems showed that two key components of the facility were found to be defective and would need to be rectified if the facility was to function properly. These components were the diesel generator which provided electricity totally independent of the grid for testing purposes, and a fault on the PLC which was affecting the operation of the electrical systems. Also several main pieces of equipment had since been removed from the facility; most notably of these being the battery banks, main test inverter and the DC supply from the wind turbines located in what is now known as the Renewable Energy Outdoor Test Area (ROTA). Several pieces of equipment required for the operation of the diesel generator would also require attention such as the fuel tank and starting battery. Approval was granted for the alternator to be repaired and placed back into service. Approval was also granted for the purchase of a replacement <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> <b>card</b> to rectify the fault with the PLC. In addition to this another requirement of the project was to develop a system so that the laboratory could be used as a training facility for future students. A procedure was developed so that an electrical system consisting of actual real components; a source, a transmission and distribution system and a load could be simulated. Software was also developed using National Instruments LabVIEW software to monitor and record various power parameters from the system. The system is referred to as the “Small Electrical Distribution System”. As an aside to this a program has been developed that monitors and records voltage, current and power that is being produced by the Real PV Array located on the roof of the Energy and Engineering Laboratory building. For someone who is unfamiliar with the setup of the electrical systems that make up the Energy and Engineering Laboratory a simplified block diagram of the Main AC switchboard has been produced. Schedules have been included of all socket inlets and outlets, main AC and communications cables and the Main AC Switchboard nomenclature. The diesel generator is nearly ready to be re-commissioned after approximately 5 years of non use. Procedures have been developed so that a user can configure the Main AC switchboard so that the “Small Electrical Distribution System” can be operated safely and measurements obtained and analysed. The main goal of the project was to get the diesel generator operating; therefore this report is focused on the equipment associated with the diesel generator. The equipment focused on was the diesel generator itself, the Main AC Switchboard, the Load Bank and the PLC system. Systems such as the Main DC switchboard and Solar Array Simulator were not covered in as much detail as they are not required for the “Small Electrical Distribution System”...|$|E
40|$|The {{submitted}} paper {{presents the}} results of research on the development of a monitoring system for HV power transformers using the IEC 61850 communication standard. The characteristic feature of this system is its implementation on Linux-based programmable PLC. Data registration functionality, aggregation, archiving and data visualization are merged on one controller. Data registration is performed through built-in digital and <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> <b>cards,</b> Ethernet and serial ports used for communication with external devices. Data aggregation and archiving is based on the MySQL database system, through data visualization and presentation thanks to an in-built HTML server with an implemented HTML web page that shows the most important parameters in real time. In addition, the implemented IEC 61850 stack enables a direct communication with the SCADA system. The stack has been implemented within the controller {{in such a way that}} the need for additional equipment, such as standard machine translation, is reduced. Both the device and all the algorithms developed in the Institute of Electrical Engineering allow collecting and recording the signals in real time, and moreover make a preliminary diagnosis of the transformer...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{control is}} an {{approach}} to evaluate process system with real-time parameters by controlling selected variables to accomplish the control objectives. Real-time issues such as rapid testing, nonlinearity and computational problem have led researchers {{in recent years to}} do intensive work on development methodologies to enhance control in real-time. Selection of control approaches has also been reviewed to adapt with these real-time issues apart from other strategies. In this research, a predictive algorithm namely Generalized Predictive Control will be evaluated in real-time by applying LabVIEW software as tools for algorithm implementation. LabVIEW is chosen because of its block diagram implementation with simple graphical user interface approach to execute algorithm in real-time faster. Hence, it is essential for complex algorithm to control real-time process system. Coupled-tanks have been identified as process models that are inherently nonlinear and hard to control due to unavailability of the exact modelsâ€™ descriptions. As for this, real time control will be applied to the coupled tank as the test bed for level control process. Experimental evaluation and comparison of the predictive algorithm performance will be benchmarked against PID control. PC and <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> output <b>card</b> will be used as the controller and also for data acquisition and realtime data display...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION There {{are several}} {{advantageous}} with analogue implementations of neural networks. The main one is, of course, that most signal sensors generate analogue signals. Several years ago Intel introduced the Electrically Trainable Neural Network, ETANN i 80170 NX [1 - 4], {{with a fairly}} conventional back-propagation (BP) algorithm and a processing time of a few micro seconds. The main disadvantageous of the analogue implementations are the relatively low precision (12 %), the sensitivity to noise {{and the fact that}} one generally requires some post-processing of the outputs from the neural networks. This is generally performed using some von Neumann computer, i. e a digital machine. Pulse Coupled neural Networks, PCNN, [5 - 10] could easily be implemented as hybrid circuits, i. e. an <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> and a digital output. One would simply have an <b>analogue</b> <b>input</b> to the circuit and make use of the inherent feature that the output is a temporal series of binary images. However, as has be...|$|R
