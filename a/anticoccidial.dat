40|$|Manuscripts {{documenting the}} {{occurrence}} of resistance against all commonly used <b>anticoccidial</b> drugs abroad, together with {{the high incidence of}} clinical coccidiosis in the field (60 - 90 % of flocks) in the Netherlands, were the reasons to start investigations on {{the occurrence of}} <b>anticoccidial</b> drug resistance of Dutch and other European Eimeria spp. field isolates. The results showed a high degree of resistance against most tested <b>anticoccidial</b> drugs. The research performed in this thesis was preceded by an extensive literature review focusing on <b>anticoccidial</b> products and alternative strategies. Based on this literature study one alternative coccidiosis control strategy, namely a mannanoligosaccharide (a prebiotic), was chosen for further experimental studies in broiler chickens. Additionally, two other products i. e. ibuprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)) and a mucolytic enzyme (protease) were also used in experimental research aiming at assessing their <b>anticoccidial</b> potential. Ibuprofen was chosen because as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor it was expected to reduce the pathology of coccidiosis lesions through impairment of the production of prostaglandins, and because it was reported that another NSAID (indometacin) was able to reduce oocyst shedding. The mucolytic enzyme was studied as it was speculated that a protease might block the attachment of Eimeria to the mucus layer through its degradation. In view of the poor <b>anticoccidial</b> effect found in the studies performed with mannanoligosaccharide, ibuprofen and the mucolytic enzyme, further research focused on vaccination against chicken Eimeria, which despite some drawbacks has shown to be highly effective against outbreaks of clinical coccidiosis. Another reason to focus on vaccination was the inefficacy of rotation and shuttle programs to solve the coccidiosis resistance problem, which is {{explained by the fact that}} resistance is stable even in the absence of drug selection pressure. A welcome side effect of vaccination is the improved sensitivity of Eimeria spp. field isolates for <b>anticoccidial</b> drugs reported by some researchers. This phenomenon may play a key role in reducing the <b>anticoccidial</b> drug resistance problem. However, large-scale field studies documenting this were lacking. Therefore, the relation between the coccidiosis prevention program (vaccination with a live attenuated <b>anticoccidial</b> vaccine or <b>anticoccidial</b> drugs in feed) and <b>anticoccidial</b> drug sensitivity profiles of Eimeria spp. field isolates for diclazuril and monensin was studied. The results showed that use of vaccination was associated with an increased sensitivity of Eimeria spp. field isolates to <b>anticoccidial</b> drugs. Coccidiosis vaccines could be produced more efficiently if cross protection between Eimeria spp. would be relevant enough to reduce the number of species included in the vaccine and/or reduce the vaccination dose. Therefore, cross protection studies between an E. acervulina vaccine line and E. tenella, and E. maxima were performed. The results showed complete protection against E. acervulina, partial cross protection against E. tenella but no cross protection against E. maxima.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a review of}} the current trends in the analysis of coccidiostats in various matrices, focusing principally on screening and rapid methods. Coccidiosis is an infectious disease having a high negative impact on the animal industry. Drugs are therefore necessary to prevent and/or to combat this disease. However, it is also of crucial importance that these veterinary drugs do not enter the human food chain. European legislation has therefore established the boundaries for the use of coccidiosats and has also addressed the unavoidable problem of cross-contamination of the feed, mainly caused by the use of the same production lines. Consequently {{there is a need for}} analytical methods and/or analytical strategies for the monitoring and control of the residues of <b>anticoccidials,</b> both in feed and in the resulting matrices for human consumption. In the frame of the European collaborative project CONffIDENCE, such attempts to establish the required analytical tools were made, which required beforehand {{a review of the}} state of the art in this domain. Aiming at this objective, in this review we consider themost interesting publications since 2000. In essence, both a rapid approach with mainly immunoassays and chromatographic methods were developed. To date, the obstacle to routine use of the first approach has been its inability to detect more than two compounds simultaneously, but recent developments in flow cytometry have made it possible to detect six coccidiostats at once. On the other hand, an increasingly popular approach for detecting multiple coccidiostats simultaneously is liquid chromatography coupledwith tandemmass spectrometry. There remains a need to adapt these analytical methods to legislative requirements...|$|R
40|$|Coccidiosis is an {{economically}} important disease in chickens, caused by infection with Eimeria species. Due to increasing resistance against <b>anticoccidials</b> and European legislation to forbid prophylactic in-feed medication by 2012, alternatives {{for the current}} control strategy with <b>anticoccidials</b> in feed should be considered. Vaccination {{might be a good}} alternative, but is not often applied in broilers due to high costs and disappointing results. 	Suboptimal results of vaccination might be caused by insufficient uptake of vaccine by part of the flock, due to mass application. However, this was not studied to this date. Studying transmission of vaccine or field strains can increase knowledge on infection dynamics in vaccinated flocks, which might contribute to optimalisation of vaccine programs. Therefore, an experiment was carried out where transmission and excretion of vaccine and field strains were examined and effects on body weight were assessed. 	The experiment consisted of a vaccination period from days 2 - 27 and a challenge period from days 28 - 49 of age. On day 2 of age, 88 SPF broilers were divided in four groups of 22 animals: group 1 remained unvaccinated (NV, control group). In groups 2 - 4 half of the flock (11 animals) was vaccinated (Vaccinated, V birds) with 600 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts of the Paracox vaccine (Intervet). The other 11 birds of each group were sham vaccinated with water (Contact-Vaccinated, CV birds). In the challenge period, birds from groups 1 - 4 were divided into eight groups of 10 birds. Groups 2 A, 3 A, 4 A consisted of V birds and groups 2 B, 3 B and 4 B of CV birds. Groups 1 A and 1 B consisted of NV birds. In all groups, except 4 A and 4 B (unchallenged vaccinated controls), five birds per group were challenged (inoculated, I birds) with 5000 sporulated oocysts of a field strain of E. acervulina and five were not (contact-inoculated, CI birds). Individual droppings were examined daily from days 5 - 49 to determine OPG (number of oocysts per gram of faeces). The total infection delay time, i. e. time between expected and actual start of excretion added for all CV or CI birds per group, was determined as a measure for transmission of the Eimeria strain. Body weights were determined on day 0 and weekly from day 2 - 49. 	In the vaccination period, all 11 CV birds became infected and total infection delay times were, 16, 12 and 18 days for groups 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The peak of output was significantly higher for CV birds compared to V birds. In the challenge period, all CI birds became infected and total infection delay time was zero days for groups 1 A, 1 B (NV) and 3 A (V), one day for groups 2 B and 3 B (CV) and nine days for group 2 A (V). Total oocyst output after challenge infection by NV birds was significantly higher compared to CV or V birds but was not significanty different between CV and V birds or between CI and I birds. A significant difference in body weight between V and CV birds was only found at day 7 after vaccination, when V birds showed a slight growth check. During the challenge period, body weights could not be compared due to large differences in cage conditions. 	From these results it can be concluded that direct or contact-vaccination apparently could not reduce the (rate of) transmission of the field strain of E. acervulina, but did reduce oocyst output after challenge compared to non-vaccinated birds. When birds were not directly vaccinated but were into contact with vaccinated birds, i. e. contact-vaccinated, a similar degree of protection against high oocyst output after challenge infection occurred. 	The {{results of this study suggest}} that vaccinating only part of the flock might be applicable in vaccination programmes. The absence of differences in rate of transmission between non-vaccinated and (contact) -vaccinated birds suggest that the probability of coming into contact with infectious material might play a more important role for spread of vaccine strains than the number of oocysts in the environment. Consequently, in future vaccination efficacy studies, effects of bird density and available space for the birds should be evaluated as well...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{increasing}} resistance of Eimeria spp. against <b>anticoccidials,</b> objections of consumers and legislative restrictions against medicated feed in de EU {{it is necessary}} to develop new strategies against coccidiosis. The severity of the disease is often (partially) dependent on the initial contamination dose, which has a great influence on infection dynamics within a flock. Obtaining insight into (influencing) the dynamics of Eimeria in a population is essential for optimizing and evaluating control strategies. 	For this purpose two transmission experiments where carried out, in a group of 20 broilers. One SPF broiler was orally inoculated on day 2 with 5 sporulated oocysts of E. acervulina, placed in a gelatinous capsule. On day 3, the inoculated animal was placed in a 1000 cm 2 litter pen with 19 non-inoculated contact birds. From day 6 to day 30 (Experiment 1) or day 31 (Experiment 2), each bird was placed in a cat transport cage during one hour per day, to produce a single dropping. Number of oocysts per gram of faeces (OPG) of the single droppings was determined, using the McMaster technique. Sedimentation flotation technique was carried out when samples where negative or when a negative result was expected. 	The inoculated bird tested positive in both techniques on day 7, in both experiments. In Experiment 1 the inoculated bird tested positive during 2 days, in Experiment 2 during 1 day. Oocyst excretion in contact birds in Experiment 1 started on day 12 (n= 1), day 13 (n= 14), day 14 (n= 3) or on day 16 (n= 1). In Experiment 2, oocyst excretion in contact birds started at day 12 (n= 4), day 13 (n= 6), day 14 (n= 4), day 15 (n= 2), day 17 (n= 2) or on day 18 (n= 1). 	Contact birds that shedded oocysts before day 16 (C 1 -animals) where infected by uptake of oocysts shedded by the inoculated bird. Animals who shedded oocysts from day 16 (C 2 -animals) where most likely infected by uptake of oocysts shedded by formerly infected contact birds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of oocyst output of these C 2 -animals is higher than the AUC of the C 1 -animals. The peaks in oocysts output of C 2 -animals is also higher than the peaks of C 1 -animals. 	These results show that not all the animals of a flock get infected at the same time, but some animals get infected by the contact birds of the first generation. Also, C 2 -birds shedded more oocysts than the C 1 -birds. This build up of infectious oocysts can result in high infectious doses for the following generations of susceptible contact birds and might cause severe clinical signs. These results have increased the understanding of the infection dynamics of an Eimeria infection in a flock. This can make a contribution towards the development of better control strategies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the <b>anticoccidial</b> activity of the ionophore CP- 84, 657 against laboratory strains of the five major pathogenic species of Eimeria that infect poultry. Based on lesion scores and weight gain, the ionophore CP- 84, 657 achieved broad-spectrum <b>anticoccidial</b> efficacy in battery trials at doses of 4 and 5 ppm that was equivalent to reference commercial ionophores. In uninfected chickens, 4 ppm of CP- 84, 657 was the highest dose that gave growth rate and feed efficiency equivalent to commercial agents over 21 days in batteries and 49 days in floor pens. Ionophore CP- 84, 657 is an efficacious, well-tolerated <b>anticoccidial</b> in chickens, with potency com-parable {{to that of the}} most potent known ionophores...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} trial a total of 250 day-old male chicks were {{distributed}} into five treatments and given the following diets: a diet with growth promoter; a diet without added growth promoter; a diet added with avilamycin only; diet supplemented with 0. 5 g of oregano oil kg diet- 1; 1. 0 g of oregano oil kg diet- 1. In other trial a total of 288 day-old chicks was used and distributed into four treatments, which were given the following diets: a diet with <b>anticoccidial</b> agent; a diet without <b>anticoccidial</b> agent; a diet supplemented with 0. 5 g of oregano oil kg diet- 1; a 1. 0 g of oregano oil kg diet- 1.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>anticoccidial</b> {{efficacy}} of a herb, neem fruit (Azadirachta indica) is {{compared with an}} ionophorus <b>anticoccidial</b> Kokcisan (salinomycin sodium) against coccidiosis in broilers. Two hundred and forty one-day-old broiler chicks were reared for 42 days. These birds were divided into 6 groups i. e. A,B,C,D,E and F comprising of 40 birds each. There were six treatments, 25 gm salinomycin sodium/ 50 kg feed (A), 50 gm ground neem fruit/ 50 kg feed (B), 100 gm ground neem fruit / 50 kg feed (C), 150 gm ground neem fruit/ 50 kg feed (D), infected non-medicated (E), non-infected non-medicated (F). Groups A,B,C,D and E were given a challenge dose of coccidial oocyst {{at the age of}} 22 days. Weight gain, feed consumption, oocysts in the faeces, clinical findings and mortality were recorded. The result revealed that the birds of non-infected non-medicated group had better (P 0. 05). Moreover, neem fruit 150 gm/ 50 kg feed had excellent performance in terms of oocyst count and lower mortality as compared to other treated groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT Lasalocid at the {{concentration}} of. 0075 % (68 g/ton) {{with and without}} roxarsone 45. 4 g/ton was fed {{in combination with the}} growth promotants bacitracin methylene disalicylate 200 g/ton, bambermycins 2 g/ton, lincomycin 4 g/ton, nosiheptide 2. 5 g/ton, zinc bacitracin 200 g/ton, and virginiamycin 20 g/ton exhibited a high degree of <b>anticoccidial</b> activity against mixed Eimeria infection in chickens in 9 day challenged battery trials. In these short term challenge trials chicks fed lasalocid, and the lasalocid growth promotant combinations, performed significantly better (P<. 05) for growth and <b>anticoccidial</b> efficacy than those fed the growth promotants alone, and the infected, unmedicated controls. In almost all instances, the lasalocid-roxarsone-antibiotic combinations allowed for numerical increases in gains, improvement in feed conversion, and numerical decreases in lesions (in some cases, statistically significant (P<. 05) over chicks fed lasalocid alone and/or the lasalocid antibiotic combination. The growth promotants did not inter-fere with the <b>anticoccidial</b> activity of lasalocid. The growth promotants fed alone exhibited no <b>anticoccidial</b> activity. However, when roxarsone was combined with the antibiotics, the combination resulted in numerically improved performance, reduced mortality, and in most instances, statistically significant decreases in lesions (P<. 05) over the infected, unmedicated control...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Continuous {{feeding of}} the <b>anticoccidial</b> {{halofuginone}} to broilers {{is associated with}} reduced skin tensile strength and increased skin tearing during processing. The possible mitigating effect of shuttle administration of halofuginone and salinomycin to female broilers was evaluated. Halofuginone or salinomycin {{were included in the}} starter and grower diets in all four possible combinations, with <b>anticoccidial</b> omitted from the finisher diets. Starter, grower, and finisher diets were fed to broilers through 3, 6, and 7 wk of age, respectively. Skin strength of pullets fed a diet based on milo and corn (NW) vs a diet based on corn was also compared in a factorial arrangement. Two further treatments were also included: 1) halofuginone-only NW diet supplemented with 2, 500 ppm ascorbic acid from 0 to 7 wk; and 2) NW diet reared on wire floor without <b>anticoccidial</b> treatment. Skin tensile strength was determined at 3, 6, and 7 wk of age. Dietary composition had no effect upon skin strength or BW of broilers. Addition of ascorbic acid to the diet containing halofuginone <b>anticoccidial</b> did not improve skin strength. Continuous feeding of halofuginone reduced skin strength whereas withholding <b>anticoccidial</b> and continuous feeding of salinomycin resulted in high skin strength. When halofuginone was used in shuttle feeding programs with salinomycin, there were no differences in skin strength at 7 wk of age compared to birds that were continuously treated with salinomycin. These results suggest halofuginone may be used in a shuttle program either during the starter or grower phase without adverse affect on skin tensile strength at slaughter...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was planned to {{evaluate}} the <b>anticoccidial</b> activity of the different concentrations of the HCl against Eimeria tenella infection in broiler chickens {{in comparison with the}} amprolium <b>anticoccidial.</b> For this purpose, a total of 198 chicks were placed 11 per pen with three pens per treatment. The different concentrations of HCl (1000 ppm, 2000 ppm and 3000 ppm) and amproilum (at the dose rate of 125 ppm) were given to the experimental groups in drinking water from 10 to 19 th days of age. One group was kept as infected non medicated control and one as non infected non medicated control. At the 12 th day of age, all the groups were inoculated orally with 75, 000 sporulated oocysts except non infected non medicated control. <b>Anticoccidial</b> activity was evaluated on the basis of performance (weight gain, feed conversion ratio) and pathogenic (oocyst score, lesion score and mortality %age) parameters. Among HCl medicated groups, the maximum <b>anticoccidial</b> effect was seen in the group medicated with 1000 ppm HCl followed by 2000 ppm and 3000 ppm HCl medicated groups. Amprolium and 1000 ppm HCl were almost equivalent in suppressing the negative performance and pathogenic effects associated with coccidiosis (Eimeria tenella) challenge. In summary, the lower doses of HCl have the potential to be used as alternative to chemotherapeutic drugs for Eimeria tenella control. It is therefore suggested that further studies should be carried out to determine the possible minimum safe levels of HCl with least toxic effects to be used as <b>anticoccidial...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Avian {{coccidiosis}} is {{a disease}} caused worldwide by several species of parasite Eimeria that causes significant economic losses. This disease affects chickens development and production, that most of times is controlled with <b>anticoccidial</b> drugs. Although efforts {{have been made to}} address this disease, they have been made to control Eimeria sporozoites, although enteric stages are often vulnerable, however; the parasite oocyst remains a problem that must be controlled, as it has a resistant structure that facilitates dispersion. Despite some commercial products based on chemical compounds have been developed as disinfectants that destroy oocysts, the solution of the problem remains to be solved. Results: In this work, we assessed in vitro <b>anticoccidial</b> activity of a compound(s) secreted by yeast isolated in oocysts suspension from infected chickens. The yeast was molecularly identified as Meyerozyma guilliermondii, and its <b>anticoccidial</b> activity against Eimeria tenella oocysts was assessed. Here, we report the damage to oocysts walls caused by M. guilliermondii culture, supernatant, supernatant extract and intracellular proteins. In all cases, a significant decreased of oocysts was observed. Conclusions: The yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii secretes a compound with <b>anticoccidial</b> activity and also has a compound of protein nature that damages the resistant structure of oocyst, showing the potential of this yeast and its products as a feasible method of coccidiosis control...|$|E
