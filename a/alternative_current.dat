50|$|Magnetic {{actuators}} offer {{very good}} linearity of the tilt angle versus the applied signal amplitude, both in static and dynamic operation. The working principle {{is that a}} metallic coil {{is placed on the}} moving MEMS mirror itself and as the mirror is placed in a magnetic field, the <b>alternative</b> <b>current</b> flowing in the coil generate Lorentz force that tilts the mirror. Magnetic actuation can either be used for actuating 1D or 2D MEMS mirrors. Another characteristics of the magnetically actuated MEMS mirror is the fact the low voltage is required (below 5V) making this actuation compatible with standard CMOS voltage. An advantage of such actuation type is that MEMS behavior does not present hysteresis, as opposed to electrostatic actuated MEMS mirrors, that make it very simple to control. Power consumption of magnetically actuated MEMS mirror can be as low as 0.04 mW.|$|E

50|$|Snubbers are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the current switching device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term <b>alternative</b> <b>current</b> path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).|$|E
5000|$|This grant {{led to the}} {{construction}} projects inaugurated in 1928 (photo circa 1928). The East annex was moved and became the infirmary; in its place, the brick building of the Couillard's wing was built. The West annex was also moved and became the north part of the [...] "Ruche" [...] (hive); in its place the St-Helen's wing was built. The coal-fire steam heating plant was built with its tall chimney. Later, coal was replaced by oil, then by wood. A larger water tower was built and a steam pump was used to pump water from the lake through a 6" [...] copper pipe. The potable water still came from the well at the previous water tower. Concrete tunnels were used to deliver water and steam to all the buildings. Between the nun's villa and the sanatorium, the tunnel was {{large enough to be}} used by employees during the hard winters when the temperature often drops below forty degrees. A steam turbine drove a direct current generator. In 1950, it was replaced by two <b>alternative</b> <b>current</b> generators with two diesel engines each (used alternatively) that also supplied the village until the prolongation of Hydro Québec's power lines in 1967-1968.|$|E

50|$|Induced-charge {{electrokinetics}} {{in physics}} is the electrically driven fluid flow and particle motion in a liquid electrolyte. Consider a metal particle (which is neutrally charged but electrically conducting) {{in contact with}} an aqueous solution in a chamber/channel. If different voltages apply {{to the end of}} this chamber/channel, electric field will generate in this chamber/channel. This applied electric field passes through this metal particle and causes the free charges inside the particle migrate under the skin of particle. As a result of this migration, the negative charges moves to the side which is close to the positive (or higher) voltage while the positive charges moves to {{the opposite side of the}} particle. These charges under the skin of conducting particle attract the counter-ions of the aqueous solution; thus, the electric double layer (EDL) forms around the particle. The EDL sing on the surface of the conducting particle changes from positive to negative and the distribution of the charges varies along the particle geometry. Due to these variations, the EDL is non-uniform and has different sings. Thus, the induced zeta potential around the particle, and consequently slip velocity on the surface of the particle, vary as a function of local electric field. Differences in magnitude and direction of slip velocity on the surface of the conducting particle effects the flow pattern around this particle and causes micro vortices. Yasaman Daghighi and Dongqing Li, for the first time, experimentally illustrated these induced vortices around a 1.2mm diameter carbon-steel sphere under the 40V/cm Direct Current (DC) external electric filed.Chenhui Peng et al. also experimentally showed the patterns of electro-osmotic flow around an Au sphere when <b>Alternative</b> <b>Current</b> (AC) is involved (E=10mV/μm, f=1 kHz).Electrokinetics here refers to a branch of science related to the motion and reaction of charged particles to the applied electric filed and its effects on its environment. It is sometimes referred as non-linear electrokinetic phenomena as well.|$|E

They were then {{used as the}} dye-sensitized solar cell counter electrodes. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that polypyrrole forms a nanoparticle-like structure on the conductive glass. The amount of deposited polypyrrole (or film thickness) increased with the deposition duration, {{and the performance of}} polypyrrole based-dye-sensitized solar cells is dependant upon polymer thickness. The highest efficiency of <b>alternative</b> <b>current</b> and direct current polypyrrole based-dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is 4. 72 % and 4. 02 %, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggests that the superior performance of <b>alternative</b> <b>current</b> polypyrrole solar cells is due to their lower charge-transfer resistance between counter electrode and electrolyte. The large charge-transfer resistance of direct current solar cells is attributed to the formation of unbounded polypyrrole chains minimizing the I 3 [*]− reduction rate...|$|E
