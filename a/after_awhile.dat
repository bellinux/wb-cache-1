2500|$|During an Artform {{interview}} with Willoughby Sharp in 1969, Beuys {{added to his}} famous statement - [...] "teaching is my greatest work of art" [...] - that “the rest is the waste product, a demonstration. If you want to express yourself you must present something tangible. But <b>after</b> <b>awhile</b> this has only the function of a historic document. Objects aren’t very important any more. I {{want to get to}} the origin of matter, to the thought behind it." [...] Beuys saw his role of an artist as a teacher or shaman who could guide society in a new direction (Sotheby's catalog, 1992).|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>awhile,</b> the {{minister}} fixed {{his eyes on}} Hester Prynne's.|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>awhile</b> he roused himself, {{and began}} to drink wine furiously.|$|E
60|$|Grace looked <b>after</b> him <b>awhile,</b> as one stunned; {{and then}} turned to her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well!' I answered. 'Lorenzo {{asked me}} {{about the state of}} Forli, and I told him. Then, <b>after</b> {{thinking}} <b>awhile,</b> he said, [...] "Tell this to Checco--"' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, my lord," [...] said Martin, <b>after</b> pausing <b>awhile</b> {{and looking}} very contemplative during the time, [...] "I {{certainly}} have the money; that is, I and mother together; but--" ...|$|R
60|$|Again there {{returned}} silence, broken <b>after</b> <b>awhile</b> by George, this time.|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>awhile,</b> up came Jack Brimblecombe on deck, {{a bottle}} in his hand.|$|E
60|$|But <b>after</b> <b>awhile</b> Griswold {{began to}} think he was in a terrible dilemma.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} lieutenant, <b>after</b> {{listening}} <b>awhile.</b> [...] "You young fellows always hear women's voices. If {{you are going}} to dream you had better get into your hammock. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Having assured {{themselves}} {{that here was}} a human habitation, it remained to be ascertained whether it was tenanted. <b>After</b> waiting <b>awhile</b> {{to see if anyone}} passed in or out, Otter undertook this task. Going down {{on his hands and knees}} he crept up to the wall, then along it to the doorway, and <b>after</b> listening there <b>awhile</b> he lifted a corner of the hide curtain and peeped into the interior. Presently he rose, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Janet," [...] said Mary, <b>after</b> pausing <b>awhile,</b> [...] "you {{had better}} leave me alone. Don't {{be angry with}} me; but really {{it will be better}} that you should leave me alone." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>awhile,</b> {{he pushed}} the boat out of its shelter on to the {{glittering}} water, and seized the paddle.|$|E
60|$|He {{became quite}} calm <b>after</b> <b>awhile.</b> Even his passion {{seemed to have}} died down {{under the weight of}} this immense sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "For God's sake, André, {{stop that}} irritating noise," [...] said Mme. Duchesse <b>after</b> <b>awhile,</b> [...] "that tapping has {{got on my}} nerves." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Baleka {{was very}} clever: {{she did not}} shriek, as most girls would have done. No; she understood, and, <b>after</b> waiting <b>awhile,</b> she rose and crept from the hut, her blanket in her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, brook! Oh, {{foolish and}} {{tiresome}} little brook!" [...] cried Pearl, <b>after</b> listening <b>awhile</b> to its talk, [...] "Why art thou so sad? Pluck up a spirit, {{and do not}} be all the time sighing and murmuring!" ...|$|R
60|$|It continued, however, without cessation; and the {{monotonous}} {{beating of}} the rain overhead began to exert a drowsy influence upon the men, who, throwing themselves here and there upon the large war-canoes, <b>after</b> chatting <b>awhile,</b> all fell asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] {{she said}} <b>after</b> <b>awhile,</b> [...] "could make a {{difference}} to our marriage, Luke. Except, of course, if you ceased to care." ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>after</b> <b>awhile</b> Umslopogaas left me {{and went}} to the hut of Zinita, his Inkosikasi, where she lay wrapped in her blankets, and, as it seemed, asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Dick and Sam {{will be here}} <b>after</b> <b>awhile.</b> And then, if you wish, we'll air all of your doings {{since the}} time Captain Putnam {{discharged}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|They obeyed, and, <b>after</b> {{thinking}} <b>awhile,</b> Panda made {{a motion}} with his hand, whereon the two councillors lifted the kaross from off Mameena, who looked about her calmly {{and asked if}} she were taking part in some child's game.|$|R
60|$|So, <b>after</b> waiting <b>awhile,</b> I {{returned}} to my room, closed the window, drew the grille across again, and dragged the heavy curtain before the opening; then, having extinguished my candles, went to bed in the dark. In a few minutes I must have been asleep.|$|R
6000|$|I {{answered}} [...] "Yes," [...] {{that was}} {{from my point}} of view, since otherwise I saw no chance of achieving the object that had caused me to enter upon this adventure. Then, being especially requested to do so, the Sergeant, <b>after</b> reflecting <b>awhile,</b> gave his considered opinion.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the man, mejuffrouw," [...] began Stoutenburg <b>after</b> <b>awhile,</b> [...] "who on New Year's day at Haarlem {{dared to}} lay hands upon your person. Do you {{recognize}} him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you assuming, citizen Chauvelin," [...] queried Carrier <b>after</b> <b>awhile,</b> [...] "that this {{packet of}} papers was dropped {{purposely}} by the Englishman, {{so that it}} might get into our hands?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must wait," [...] {{answered}} Oliver Wadsworth, who was along. [...] "I {{think his}} mind will clear <b>after</b> <b>awhile.</b> It is certainly clearer {{now than it}} was some months ago." ...|$|E
60|$|She did {{not move}} or answer, but {{remained}} with her face turned full away, {{so that he could}} see only the contour of her cheek. <b>After</b> waiting <b>awhile,</b> he flushed, turned swiftly and set his machine rattling. In a moment he was racing between the trees.|$|R
6000|$|<b>After</b> sitting <b>awhile</b> in {{contemplation of}} this person's {{familiar}} contour, I was irresistibly moved to step over the intervening benches, lay {{my hand on}} his shoulder, put my mouth close to his ear, and address him in a sepulchral, melodramatic whisper: [...] "Hollingsworth! where have you left Zenobia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See now, Shepherdess," [...] said Olfan <b>after</b> {{thinking}} <b>awhile,</b> [...] "shall we {{take this}} man for a guide and return down the cliff to the city, for there, unless fate is against us, we may find friends among the soldiers and fight out this battle with the priests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, father, and I'll {{explain it}} all <b>after</b> <b>awhile.</b> But {{now you are}} hurt, and you must take it easy. Did you tumble over the cliff, or did that bear----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you tell}} me what you did hear?" [...] he asked <b>after</b> <b>awhile,</b> with seeming calm, though he felt as if his words must choke him, and her answer strike him dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "A curious personality, that knave," [...] he said {{carelessly}} <b>after</b> <b>awhile,</b> [...] "an unscrupulous devil as daring {{as he is}} reckless {{of consequences}} I should say ... yet trustworthy withal ... what think you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had never}} heard her speak like this before, and did not {{remember}} that intense feeling {{is the mother of}} eloquence. He gazed {{at her for a moment}} in astonishment; then he dropped his face into his hands again and groaned, making no other answer. <b>After</b> waiting <b>awhile,</b> she went on-- ...|$|R
60|$|He rested <b>awhile</b> <b>after</b> this. The idea {{of death}} alone seemed entertaining. Then, 'Is there really nothing I could turn to?' he asked himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will walk}} with you, and smoke my last cigar." [...] So they went out, {{and up to}} Heale's. Tom went in: but he {{observed}} that his companion, <b>after</b> standing <b>awhile</b> in the street irresolutely, went on up the hill, and, {{as far as he}} could see, turned up the lane to Vavasour's.|$|R
