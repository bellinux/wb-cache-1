40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} keys to improving track safety standards {{is to establish a}} strong correlation between track geometry variations and wheel-rail force parameters that are indicators of vehicle-track safety performance. In this study, wheel-rail forces were collected during field tests of a loaded lumber car and an empty tank car. Computer models of the two tested freight cars were built, and the models were calibrated using field test results. The computer models were then used to evaluate the impact of varying track geometry parameters on track safety using the maximum single wheel L/V ratio, maximum truck side L/V ratio, and minimum vertical wheel load ratio. It was confirmed again that the correlations between these force parameters and any individual geometry parameter were weak. With further investigation, it was found that much better correlation can be achieved using multiple regression techniques to define each wheel-rail force parameter as a function of all track geometry parameters combined together. Expressions of the maximum truck side L/V ratio, maximum single wheel L/V ratio, and minimum vertical wheel load ratio were obtained as functions of curvature, cross level, <b>alignment,</b> <b>gauge,</b> and cant deficiency using multiple regression analysis.

5000|$|When {{building}} the railway Line {{the company had}} limited finances, the line was built to the [...] Narrow Gauge and included long sections of steep gradients and sharp curves. The final eighteen kilometres of the route from Western Junction to Launceston used the existing Broad <b>gauge</b> <b>alignment</b> of the Launceston and Western Railway, with a third rail being laid {{for use by the}} narrow gauge trains. The Railway Line was officially opened on 1 November 1876. As Tasmania has a very competitive Road Transport industry and a modern road network, only limited deviations have been built in the Main line's 125-year history. Although the line still follows the original alignment, the standard of the track has improved by the use of heavier rail welded into long lengths, steel sleepers and better ballast. The line remains in service, and sees multiple freight trains most days, these generally operating Burnie to Boyer and Burnie / Launceston to Hobart and return.|$|R

Semi-periodic profiles of rail irregularities consisting of elevation, <b>alignment,</b> cross and <b>gauge</b> irregularities have also been proposed using FRA maximum tolerable rail deviations.

The resulting system matrices of train and bridge are very sparse, and, thus, are stored in one-dimensional arrays, yielding a time-efficient solution. A numerical algorithm for computing bridge-train response including an iterative scheme is also formulated. A program simulating train-bridge interaction and solving this problem using the new algorithm is implemented as new modules for the finite element analysis software named XFINAS. Computed results using the new program are then checked by that of the validated 2 -D bridge-train interaction model.

40|$|Abstract — Over its {{useful life}} a railway track {{is subject to}} many {{mechanical}} and environmental stresses which gradually lead to its deterioration. Monitoring the wear condition of the railway superstructure {{is one of the}} key points to guarantee an adequate safety level of the railway transport system; in this field, the use of high-efficiency laser techniques has become consolidated and implemented in diagnostic trains (e. g. the “Archimede train” and the “Talete train”) which allow to detect the track geometric parameters (<b>gauge,</b> <b>alignment,</b> longitudinal level, cross level, superelevation defect, etc.) and the state of rail wear (vertical, horizontal, 45 -degree etc.) with very high accuracy. The objective of this paper is to describe a new non-conventional procedure for detecting the transverse profile of worn-out rails by means of image-processing technique. This methodological approach is based on the analysis of the information contained in high-resolution photographic images of rails and on specific algorithms which allow to obtain the exact geometric profile and the measurement of the relevant deviations compared to new rails of the same typology. The analyses and the first results, obtained from laboratory researches, concern rails cross sections taken from railway lines under upgrading. The procedure has shown high precision in the wear evaluation as well as great rapidity in being performed...|$|R
50|$|With {{the line}} into Utah complete, the D&RG system {{consisted}} of a main line from Denver to Ogden, passing through or over Colorado Springs, Pueblo, the Royal Gorge, Salida, Marshall Pass, Gunnison, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Montrose, Grand Junction, Green River, and Salt Lake City. It included numerous branches, but only three west of Grand Junction - to Pleasant Valley, Bingham Canyon, and Little Cottonwood Canyon. The main line began by following {{the valley of the}} Grand (Colorado) River west out of Grand Junction, but curved away at Mack to avoid Ruby Canyon. Some steep grades and sharp curves carried the original line over the highlands north of the river, crossing the state line and continuing southwesterly and westerly to Green River, Utah. Curving northwest around the Beckwith Plateau, the railroad crossed the Price River at Woodside, where it began to follow that river through its valleys and canyons. Almost immediately, due to flooding, the railroad had to be removed from the canyon between Grassy Trail (south of Cedar) and Farnham (southeast of Wellington), though it remained alongside the river from Grassy Trail southeast to Woodside until bypassed by the present standard <b>gauge</b> <b>alignment.</b> Continuing on, the line passed through the Price Canyon, including the Castle Gate rock formation, as it rose {{to the top of the}} Wasatch Range at Soldier Summit. The Spanish Fork Canyon took the line down into the Utah Valley, with some 4% grades near the top before it met the earlier U&PV at Tucker. Through the Utah Valley and adjacent Salt Lake Valley, connected by the Jordan Narrows, the D&RGW's line closely paralleled a UP line, serving many of the valleys' populated areas. The final stretch generally followed the Great Salt Lake's shore to Ogden, where it connected to the Central Pacific Railroad.|$|R
