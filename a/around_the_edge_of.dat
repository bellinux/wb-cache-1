5|$|The 1981 Doctor Who episode Logopolis, {{which was}} filmed at Crowsley Park, used {{a model of}} the Lovell Telescope as the Pharos Project, from which the Doctor played by Tom Baker fell and regenerated. The model was based on the Mark I telescope, but it also {{featured}} some modifications from the Mark IA telescope such as the rim <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the dish.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} barbican had been {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for houses and the moat had begun to be occupied with housing. By 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bailey wall. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running {{down the side of the}} keep.|$|E
5|$|Freema Agyeman, {{who played}} Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood, {{introduced}} the episode, which was shown {{on a large}} screen above the stage and smaller screens <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall. As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting members of the audience. A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled {{him back to the}} TARDIS. The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in costume and prosthetics.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{intensification}} {{took place}} throughout September20, attaining {{the status of}} tropical storm by 1800UTC and received the name Emily. The storm tracked in a general west-northwest direction <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a strong subtropical ridge. By 1200UTC on September21, the center of Emily passed directly over St. Vincent with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Situated underneath an anticyclone, rapid intensification took place as the storm quickly tracked towards Hispaniola. In the 24-hour span between 1800UTC on September21 and 1800UTC on September22, the central barometric pressure of the storm dropped 44mbar (hPa) to 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg) and winds increased to 125mph (205km/h), equivalent to a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale. At the time of peak intensity, the hurricane hunters recorded flight-level winds of 155mph (250km/h) and unofficial pressure of 949mbar (hPa; 28.02inHg).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1785, the {{government}} had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort's guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established {{at the start of}} the century and in the 1840s new private housing was built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to turn into a prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle's guns became more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{appears to}} lie on the highest ground in the area, {{although}} this is actually located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the park and by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by {{the views of the}} keep and tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. The keep, park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders has argued that the keep and high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Etau was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004. Forming on August8, 2009 {{from an area}} of low pressure, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking in a curved path <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a subtropical ridge, Etau continued to intensify as it neared Japan. By August10, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a weak tropical storm with winds of 75km/h (45mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992hPa (mbar). Shortly after, Etau began to weaken. Increasing wind shear led to the center becoming devoid of convection and the system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August13. The remnants of Etau persisted for nearly three days before dissipating early on August16.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Moss is a {{peat bog}} in Lindow, {{an area of}} Wilmslow, Cheshire, which {{has been used as}} common land since the medieval period. It formed after the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in {{north-east}} Cheshire and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice. Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity. Once covering over , the bog has now shrunk to a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised. Lindow Moss is a lowland raised mire; this type of peat bog often produces the best preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27bodies to be recovered from such areas.|$|E
5|$|M-37 parts East Beltline Avenue {{and turns}} west along I-96. The freeway runs west and then north <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Grand Rapids. Near 3Mile Road, I-96/M-37 runs west again, {{continuing}} across the Grand River and meeting the US Highway 131 (US131) freeway. The next interchange immediately west of US131 is for Alpine Avenue, which M-37 follows north. This road runs through a commercial and retail corridor {{in the communities}} of Walker and Comstock Park. South of 6Mile Road, Alpine Avenue widen into a four-lane divided highway. This highway splits from Alpine Avenue north of 8Mile Road and turns to the northwest as the surroundings transition to rural farmland again. M-37 transitions back to a two-lane road south of Sparta. The trunkline passes {{to the west of}} Kent City and crosses into Muskegon County at Casnovia. Through this area, the highway parallels a line of the Marquette Rail that runs north from Grand Rapids.|$|E
5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable {{the animals to}} avoid it. A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts {{are thought to be}} balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E

5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the device, covers {{the top and bottom}} ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid {{on the left side of}} the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E
