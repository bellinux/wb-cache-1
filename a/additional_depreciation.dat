5000|$|At various times, <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> {{deductions}} {{have been}} allowed to encourage investment. These allowances generally have had limitations. For example, an additional deduction of 50% of the cost of qualifying property is allowed for certain property acquired after December 31, 2007 and before January 1, 2011 [...] A nearly identical allowance was available for property acquired after September 10, 2001 and before 2005. The IRS recently issued guidance clarifying when taxpayers are eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation. In addition, the guidance provides procedures for electing 100 percent bonus depreciation and 50 percent bonus depreciation for certain property. In addition to extending the availability of bonus depreciation in general, the Tax Relief Act provided for a new 100 percent depreciation deduction for qualified property that is acquired and placed into service by the taxpayer between September 8, 2010, and January 1, 2014. [...] Special rules have also apply for biofuel, recycling, and disaster assistance property.|$|E
40|$|The {{subsidiary}} company of Swedish Match AB called Intermatch Sweden AB has submitted {{a claim to}} RegR for them to change the notification of SRN, regarding the company’s settlement of foreign tax. To make the matter clear Intermatch Sweden AB {{has pointed out that}} they consider deductions for depreciations not to {{have an effect on the}} foreign income when the amount to settle is calculated. The intention with this study is to analyse the legal situation regarding how the level of the settlement is affected by the consolidated costs. Such as <b>additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> regulated in the law “Settlements of foreign tax”. In the process I will aspire to address the arguments of the study with the help of one ruling put in focus and related previous ruling. <b>Additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> of the assets, which arise due to the depreciation as recorded in the books, should not reduce the foreign income when the level of settlement is to be calculated the RegR has pronounced. I don’t see a complete analogy in the way the different consolidated costs has affected the outcome of the rulings in regards to the level of settlement. By that I mean that the costs at hand have affected the calculation in different ways and these differences have not been presented by the company in question In doing so disregarding how the denominator and the Swedish tax are affected. A new bill has been accepted and will take effect on January 1 st 2009 witch means that the issues at hand will lead to a different conclusion since <b>additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> after January 1 st 2009 will be treated as a cost of the operations when calculating the level of settlement...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the impact of previous creative accounting operations on the government’s financial performance, two approaches are used following Krishnakumar et al. (2010). A single-equation model directly estimates the impact of <b>additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> booked in the past on deficits and surpluses. Alternatively, a system of two equations, one for true revenues and one for true expenses, models the impact of previous creative accounting operations on the actual financial performance. Because of the conservative stance of the cantonal fiscal policy, models are estimated with regard to different possible outcomes. Model I considers all observation irrespective of {{the sign of the}} (subsequent) balance. Model II considers only the case where the (subsequent) true balance is positive (surplus). Model III is when the (subsequent) true balance is negative (deficit). Previous AD are especially expected to enhance (subsequent) surpluses.|$|R

For Section 1250 assets (real estate), Recaptured Depreciation is defined as [...] "Additional Depreciation" [...] in IRS Publication 544 (see column 3 on page 30 of the 2016 version of this publication). <b>Additional</b> <b>Depreciation</b> is the portion of Accumulated Depreciation in excess of straight line.

Over that period, it has recorded <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges in 28 of its 34 annual financial reports. The canton of St. Gallen (SG) was a late-adopter.

30|$|We used panel {{data about}} the 26 Swiss cantons over the period 1980 – 2013. This setting is {{interesting}} since the individual cantonal legislation sets out or tolerates depreciations management operations especially designed to inflate expenses—with the so-called <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges—and thus to worsen the financial performance {{in a way to}} specifically manage surpluses. Two different models of fiscal performance were estimated. The first model relies on a single equation with the balance (deficit or surplus) as the dependent variable. In the second model, the impact on the balance is indirectly considered since a set of two simultaneous equations is used: one with the operating revenues as the dependent variable and the other with operating expenses as the dependent variable. This simultaneous strategy allowed us to disentangle the respective effect of depreciations management on revenues and expenses and therefore provide more precise estimations compared to the single-equation model. The econometric results are based on several estimators and proved to be robust. They confirm that a positive and significant correlation exists between previous <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges and the subsequent level of revenues, whereas a negative correlation exists with the level of subsequent expenses, with a similar order of magnitude. Consequently, depreciations management seems to produce a significant positive impact on the future balance.|$|E
30|$|The cantonal {{setting is}} also {{valuable}} since a common and detailed chart of account allows {{those with the}} necessary accounting skills and understanding to detect the book entries related to depreciations management. The main book entry that allows finance ministers to inflate expenses is the so-called <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges (AD). With some insight and expert knowledge, the amount of AD that is charged to an accounting period can be spotted in the detailed annual general purpose financial report 6 of the period, since a specific budget heading in the chart of accounts is used for AD.|$|E

This deduction is fully phased out for businesses acquiring over $2,000,000 of such property during the year. [...] In addition, <b>additional</b> first year <b>depreciation</b> of 50% of the cost of most other depreciable tangible personal property is allowed as a deduction.

40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1976 is the {{culmination}} of more than two years of work by both houses of Congress. The Act is the most extensive tax reform effort since the enactment of the 1954 Code. The changes made by the Act to the partnership provisions in subchapter K are the first substantive changes in this area since the subchapter 2 ̆ 7 s enactment {{as a part of the}} 1954 Code. It is clear from the Act and the accompanying committee reports that the changes to Subchapter K were motivated by the wide use of tax shelter limited partnerships, which led Congress to believe that taxpayers abused some of the partnership provisions. Most of the changes made to Subchapter K are of a restrictive nature applicable to tax shelter limited partnerships. This comment discusses the substantive changes contained in the five subsections of section 213 of the Act. The first three subsections were intended to clarify issues which were uncertain under prior law, relating to special allocations, retroactive allocations, and guaranteed payments. The remaining two subsections narrow provisions of the prior law which were not unclear but which had been abused by taxpayers.

30|$|The {{heterogeneity}} is also {{strong in}} terms of reported and true balances of the statement of financial performance. Nonetheless, the standard deviation appears to be smaller for reported balances in many cantons, suggesting that AD is effectively used to smooth reported balances. On average <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges lower the surplus from +[*] 129 CHF per capita down to a reported amount of +[*] 61 CHF per capita. This points {{out the fact that}} Swiss cantons generally experienced a structural surplus which was partially managed thanks to the use of AD. This is at least true for cantons presenting a positive true balance (B[*]>[*] 0) on average between 1980 and 2013.|$|E
30|$|In view of this, the {{improvement}} in subsequent financial performance stemming from (previous) <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges seems to come through both channels: a support for (subsequent) tax revenue and a pressure on (subsequent) operating expenses. The effect is almost equal, with 1 additional CHF AD per capita corresponding with subsequent revenues to be 0.207 CHF higher and subsequent expenses to be 0.262 CHF lower (model I). Thus, the combined effect improves subsequent financial performance by about 0.469 CHF per capita. This impact is slightly larger than the one estimated from the single-equation model. However, this measure is more precise since the simultaneous-equation model partials out more precisely {{the effects of the}} control variables on expenses and revenues.|$|E
3000|$|On top of {{estimating}} the single-equation model using alternative estimators, several robustness checks {{were performed to}} ensure the reliability in the results.

50|$|Most recently, {{wind energy}} policy has {{continued}} through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5), {{signed into law by}} President Obama. In terms of wind energy, five areas were advanced: 1. an extension was given for the federal production tax credit (PTC) until December 31, 2012; 2. wind energy facilities can make use of an investment tax credit (ITC) for certain property in substitution for PTC; 3. wind projects initiated in 2009 and 2010 can receive a 30% grant from the Treasury Department for the cost of the property; 4. general business credits were modified; 5. the 2009 bonus depreciation was extended.

40|$|The {{accounting}} for business combinations {{has long been}} one of the most controversial financial reporting issues, generating numerous opinions and interpretations by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF). At the center of the controversy is the principal established in 1970 by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APBO) No. 16 that both the purchase method and the pooling-of-interests method are acceptable in {{accounting for}} business combinations. The distinction between purchase and pooling relates mainly to how the difference between the price paid for the common shares of the acquired company and the book value of its net assets (herein referred to as the "step-up") is accounted for on the consolidated financial statements. Under the pooling method, the step-up is not recognized and the net assets of the acquired company are combined with those of the acquiring company at their book values as though the two companies had always been a single enterprise. Under the purchase method, the acquiring company recognizes the differential by restating all assets and liabilities of the acquired company to their fair values. Consequently, the <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> and amortization expense arising from the asset write-up often associated with the purchase method leads to post-merger earnings that can be substantially lower than those reported under the pooling treatment. ...|$|E
