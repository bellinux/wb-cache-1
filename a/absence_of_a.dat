5|$|In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{required}} serpin, the protease that it {{normally would}} regulate is over-active, leading to pathologies.

However, they exhibit arrested development by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat pouches, long fur, or long-calls until they are between 15 and 20years old. The development of these characteristics depends largely on the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resident male.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating {{on the basis of}} a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.|$|E

Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant.
