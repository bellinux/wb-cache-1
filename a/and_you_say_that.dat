Not one step does he take to give me the sovereignty of Bohemia which he so solemnly promised me, and seems to think that it is honour and reward enough for me to have spent my treasure and blood in his service. But my turn is at hand, and when the hand which saved his throne shall cast him from it he will learn how rash he has been to have deceived and slighted me. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the stars last night all pointed to a favourable conjunction, and that the time for striking the great blow is at hand?" ...|$|E

And {{so you have}} both given your pledge to fight no more in this campaign. By St. George, I should not be ill-pleased if someone would put me under a similar pledge, for I tell you that I am heartily sick of it. Never did so disordered an army start from England. An army led by bishops and priests is {{something}} strange. Bishops have before now ridden often in battle, but never before did they assume command. Methinks when I go home that I will ask the king {{to give me the}} direction of Westminster Monastery and Abbey; at any rate I could not make a worse hand of it than the Bishop of Norwich is doing of this. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> De Beaulieu promised to send your armour on the first opportunity.

6000|$|What {{are those}} inductions and deductions, and {{how have you}} got at this hypothesis? You have {{observed}} in the first place, that the window is open; but by a train of reasoning involving many inductions and deductions, you have probably arrived long before at the general law--and {{a very good one}} it is--that windows do not open of themselves; and you therefore conclude that something has opened the window. A second general law that you have arrived at in the same way is, that tea-pots and spoons do not go out of a window spontaneously, and you are satisfied that, as they are not now where you left them, they have been removed. In the third place, you look at the marks on the windowsill, and the shoe-marks outside, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in all previous experience the former kind of mark has never been produced by anything else but the hand of a human being; and the same experience shows that no other animal but man at present wears shoes with hob-nails in them such as would produce the marks in the gravel. I do not know, even if we could discover any of those [...] "missing links" [...] that are talked about, that they would help us to any other conclusion! At any rate the law which states our present experience is strong enough for my present purpose. You next reach the conclusion that, as these kind [89] of marks have not been left by any other animal than man, or are liable to be formed in any other way than a man's hand and shoe, the marks in question have been formed by a man in that way. You have, further, a general law, founded on observation and experience, and that, too, is, I am sorry to say, a very universal and unimpeachable one,--that some men are thieves; and you assume at once from all these premisses--and that is what constitutes your hypothesis--that the man who made the marks outside and on the window-sill, opened the window, got into the room, and stole your tea-pot and spoons. You have now arrived at a vera causa;--you have assumed a cause which, it is plain, is competent to produce all the phenomena you have observed. You can explain all these phenomena only by the hypothesis of a thief. But that is a hypothetical conclusion, of the justice of which you have no absolute proof at all; it is only rendered highly probable by a series of inductive and deductive reasonings.|$|E

5000|$|Many commentators, both at {{the time}} that Descartes wrote and since, have argued that this {{involves}} a circular argument, as he relies upon the principle of clarity and distinctness to argue for the existence of God, and then claims that God is the guarantor of his clear and distinct ideas. The first person to raise this criticism was Antoine Arnauld, in the [...] "Fourth Set of Objections" [...] to the Meditations:"you are not yet certain of the existence of God, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you are not certain of anything. It follows from this that you do not yet clearly and distinctly know that you are a thinking thing, since, on your own admission, that knowledge depends on the clear knowledge of an existing God; and this you have not proved in the passage where you draw the conclusion that you clearly know what you are."

5000|$|In his autobiography, Gifted Hands, Carson recounted that exams for a Yale {{psychology}} course {{he took his}} junior year, [...] "Perceptions 301", were inexplicably burned, forcing students to retake the exam. Carson said that other students walked out in protest when they discovered the retest was significantly harder than the original examination, but he alone finished the test. On doing so, Carson said he was congratulated by the course instructor who told him the retest was a hoax intended to find [...] "the most honest student in the class". Carson said the professor awarded him $10, and that a photographer for the Yale Daily News was present to take his picture, {{which appeared in the}} student newspaper with a story about the experiment. Doubts were raised about this story in 2015 during Carson's presidential campaign. The Wall Street Journal attempted to verify Carson's account, reporting that Yale undergraduate courses were identified with only two digits in the early 1970s, and that Yale offered no course called [...] "Perceptions 301" [...] at that time and that Carson's photo never appeared in the Yale Daily News. Carson, while acknowledging the class number was not correct, said: [...] "You know, when you write a book with a co-writer <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there was a class, {{a lot of the time}} they’ll put a number or something just to give it more meat. You know, obviously, decades later, I’m not going to remember the course number." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bastiats {{original}} {{parable of}} the broken window from Ce quon voit et ce quon ne voit pas (1850): Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James Goodfellow, when his careless son has happened to break a pane of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly {{bear witness to the}} fact that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation - [...] "It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?"Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions.Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the accident brings six francs to the glaziers trade - that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs - I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen.But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, [...] "Stop there! Your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen."It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented.|$|E
