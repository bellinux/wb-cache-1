40|$|Limulus paramyosin and myosin were {{localized}} in the <b>A</b> <b>bands</b> <b>of</b> glycerinated Limulus {{striated muscle}} by the indirect horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody and {{direct and indirect}} fluorescent antibody techniques. Localization of each protein in the <b>A</b> <b>band</b> varied with sarcomere length. Antiparamyosin was bound at the lateral margins <b>of</b> the <b>A</b> <b>bands</b> in long (- 10. 0 µ) and intermediate (- 7. 0) u) length sarcomeres, and also in a thin line in the central <b>A</b> <b>bands</b> <b>of</b> sarcomeres, 7. 0 - 6. 0 µ. Antiparamyosin stained the entire <b>A</b> <b>bands</b> <b>of</b> short sarcomeres (< 6. 0). Conversely, antimyosin stained the entire <b>A</b> <b>bands</b> <b>of</b> long sarcomeres, showed decreased intensity <b>of</b> central <b>A</b> <b>band</b> staining except for a thin medial line in intermediate length sarcomeres, and was bound only in the lateral <b>A</b> <b>bands</b> <b>of</b> short sarcomeres. These {{results are consistent with}} a model in which paramyosin comprises the core of the thick filament and myosin forms a cortex. Differential staining observed using antiparamyosin and antimyosin at various sarcomere lengths and changes in <b>A</b> <b>band</b> lengths reflect the extent of thick-thin filament interaction and conformational change in the thick filament during sarcomeric shortening...|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> Middle Devonian {{limestone}} runs west to {{east from}} Cremyll to Plymstock including the Hoe.

To the north and north east of the city is the granite mass of Dartmoor; the granite was mined and exported via Plymouth. Rocks brought down the Tamar from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals. There is evidence that the middle Devonian limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, Cattedown and Radford.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|After the Pangaean supercontinent sundered {{during the}} Cretaceous period, the region {{became part of}} a {{shifting}} transition zone between a shallow inland sea—the Western Interior Seaway—and <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> plains and low hills to the west. A sandy and swampy coastline oscillated east and west, alternately submerging and uncovering the area atop the present Colorado Plateau that Chaco Canyon now occupies.|$|E

5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E

The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{an anecdote}} about the Second World War by the Romani {{historian}} Jacques Sigot, {{the film was}} inspired by a Romani who escaped the Nazis with help from French villagers. It depicts the rarely documented subject of Porajmos (the Romani Holocaust). Other than <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> Romani people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani. Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama.|$|E
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If <b>a</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
