25|$|Alarm {{response}} behavior varies {{according to}} the type of predator announced. If the alarm indicates a hawk diving toward the colony, all the prairie dogs in its flight path dive into their holes, while those outside the flight path stand and watch. If the alarm is for a human, all members of the colony immediately rush inside the burrows. For coyotes, the prairie dogs move to the entrance of a burrow and stand outside the entrance, observing the coyote, while those prairie dogs that were inside the burrows will come out to stand <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> well. For domestic dogs, the response is to observe, standing in place where they were when the alarm was sounded, again with the underground prairie dogs emerging to watch.|$|E

25|$|The Suns, due {{to their}} better season record, had homecourt advantage, but that would not last past game 1. In a hotly contested battle of Western Conference heavyweights, each team tried to deliver a {{knockout}} blow to the other. The Spurs finally landed it, but by accident. With {{the game in the}} balance Tony Parker and Steve Nash collided head-to-head. A large gash opened along Nash's nose and though the medical staff tried admirably, they could not stop the bleeding and he was forced to sit the final 45 seconds <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the Spurs won game 1, 111–106. Game 2 saw the Suns rebound and blow out the Spurs to a 101–81 beating. After this game, Suns center Amar'e Stoudemire labeled the Spurs a dirty team. Game 3 switched back to San Antonio and saw a return of the physical play, resulting in Manu Ginóbili receiving a bruised and bloodied eye and Nash being kneed in the groin by Bruce Bowen. However, Tim Duncan led the Spurs to a 108–101 victory.|$|E

[...] Amongst the printer's tricks were embossing of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net. [...] Other effects included burnishing by rubbing with agate to brighten colours; varnishing; overprinting; dusting with metal or mica; and sprays to imitate falling snow.|$|E
500|$|The adventurers {{evade the}} city's guardians, {{gain access to}} the temple, and find it filled with {{artifacts}} from many ancient civilizations, identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional [...] "archaeologists" [...] studying the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen alien beings, one missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. A portal to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into the portal. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley–who has regained his sanity–escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is caught in the vortex while trying to scrounge some of the treasure, and even though Jones offers him his whip to pull him to safety, he willingly lets go and is sucked in. Jones and the others escape <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the city crumbles, revealing a flying saucer rising from under the ground and vanishing, while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{appearance}} in Batman: Arkham Origins included a speech {{delivered at the}} conclusion of the character's story arch. The player is given the opportunity to observe Anarky after he has been defeated, <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society, tries to reconcile his admiration for Batman, and ultimately denounces the Caped Crusader as a false hero. Nick Dinicola of PopMatters, in comparing the game to its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City, asserted that the narrative of Origins consistently challenged Batman's ideological reasons for acting as he does, whereas City uncritically took his motivations as a given. [...] "Anarky’s wonderful speech takes Batman to task for the contradictions in his symbolism," [...] writes Dinicola, choosing that moment in the game as one of several examples of this theme. [...] "Considering that Batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear, Anarky is equating the rise of Batman with the downfall of society." [...] Dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like Anarky to scrutinize Batman's heroism, rather than simply assert it, allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold Batman as a heroic figure in a way City could not. To Dinicola, this validated the act of challenging a superhero's traditional interpretation in service to the story.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} commended {{the show for}} its {{widespread}} appeal, while others have argued the opposite and criticized it for catering solely to preschoolers. In an interview with The New York Times, Tom Ascheim said that [...] "the show's quirky appeal extended far beyond Noggin's target audience. 'The simplicity is really understandable by my two-year-old, but my ten-year-old really giggles at Oobi. Andrew Dalton of The Stir stated {{that he was a}} fan of the show himself, adding that Oobi is [...] "just happy to be simple and gleeful, and that actually makes it more appealing to sit <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> a grown-up." [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Jane Clifford felt that it could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, remarking that [...] "if as a kid you ever drew eyes or a mouth on your hand and then 'talked' to a friend, you'll relate to this show." [...] Oppositely, Rebecca Brayton of WatchMojo.com felt that while Oobi [...] "had the intentions to build academic skills in children ... it left their parents empty-handed." [...] Evan Levine of The Star Democrat stated in his review that [...] "it is certainly fun for preschoolers {{to be able to make}} their own Oobis, and they’ll no doubt relate to some of the issues discussed … parents, however, may find that the show wears thin quickly and feels a little forced." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{non-stop}} {{protests in}} Ottawa, Lawrence Cannon requested the Government of Sri Lanka {{for an immediate}} ceasefire. He also rejected calls from the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canada to stop all protests in Ottawa. Cannon condemned the LTTE for preventing civilians from leaving areas being attacked and using them as human shields. Bev Oda and the Conservative Party of Canada both condemned the use of LTTE flags, insisting that they symbolize connection with a terrorist organization. David Miller and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also condemned the Gardiner Expressway blockade. Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff had made statements on the protests in a few occasions. Ignatieff urged the Harper government to break its silence and take initiative in condemning the violence. He stated {{that there are no}} military solutions to the conflict and that the war must stop under a worldwide initiative and internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy. On 21 April, Ignatieff met with a few Tamil leaders in Ottawa to discuss the humanitarian crisis. On the occasion, he said the following: [...] "I am deeply concerned about escalating violence in Sri Lanka, and the resulting deaths of thousands of civilians. It was important for me to hear from Tamil Canadians, whose family and friends in Sri Lanka are suffering first hand from this crisis. We cannot sit back <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> thousands of innocent lives are lost in the cross-fire, and we condemn any attempt to use civilians as human shields." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he spoke, Moore {{said that}} he and others had been part of an elaborate, {{long-term}} disinformation campaign begun primarily to discredit Paul Bennewitz: [...] "My role in the affair ... was primarily that of a freelancer providing information on Paul's (Bennewitz) current thinking and activities" [...] (Clark, 1998, 163).

2500|$|According to University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci, {{this is part}} of {{a pattern}} of behaviour. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, Wikileaks {{announced}} that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party. When these e-mails were released, however, it [...] "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks." [...] According to Tufekci, there are three steps to Wikileaks' [...] "disinformation campaigns": [...] "The first step is to dump many documents at once — rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting." ...|$|E
