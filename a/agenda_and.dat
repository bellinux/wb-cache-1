5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|As a {{case study}} of disinformation, the authors {{describe}} journalist , whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence.

In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council, which operated as a front organization for Soviet intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U.S. Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had defected from their posts in Soviet intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.|$|E

5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career.

5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was {{nominated}} for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. Saddled with a shortened term, Morehead {{was not able to}} formulate a significant legislative <b>agenda,</b> <b>and</b> stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from the Democrats in the summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler {{resisted}} Clay's attempts {{to set the}} Whig <b>agenda,</b> <b>and</b> vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with no political office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it {{to him as a}} gift on his return to Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{heaviest}} fighting took place near {{the intersection of}} Wschodnia and Południowa (now Rewolucji 1905 r.) streets (where four barricades were located), near the Scheibler factory in the Źródliska park and on the Rokociny road (al. Piłsudskiego). The Rokociny area was manned by a 3,000-strong worker militia, which eventually was forced to retreat to the Źródliska park. The insurgents had no organized <b>agenda,</b> <b>and</b> commonly fought under red standards; common demands were the improvement of workers' living conditions and greater rights for the Polish population. On 23 June (or as late as 26 June – sources vary) the Tsar signed a decree of martial law in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Karnataka {{is headed by}} the Chief Minister who is chosen by the ruling party members of the Legislative Assembly.

However, the constitutional and formal {{head of the state}} is the Governor who is appointed for a five-year term by the President of India on the advice of the Union government. The people of Karnataka also elect 28 members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. The members of the state Legislative Assembly elect 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{suffered a}} big setback in the 1987 legislative election. The UCR lost {{the majority in}} the chamber of deputies. All provinces elected Peronist governors, with the exception of Córdoba and Río Negro. Along with the city of Buenos Aires (a federal district at the time), they were the only districts where the UCR prevailed. As a result, the government could not move forward with its legislative <b>agenda,</b> <b>and</b> the PJ only supported minor projects. The PJ was strengthened for the 1989 presidential elections, and the UCR sought to propose governor Eduardo Angeloz as candidate. Angeloz was a rival of Alfonsín within the party.|$|E

30|$|The macropolitics of education, {{according}} to Alderson (2009), addresses the <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> issues within {{the purview of}} national or local government (p. 2). While recognizing {{the central role of}} educational policy-making and implementation at the macropolitical level, Alderson (2009) also attaches great weight to individual factors: the personality of the players themselves, their emotions, their ambitions, their <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> their influence (p. 2). Macro-level educational policy often involves innovations in language education, which requires individuals within an educational institution to respond to and to take actions. It is therefore argued that “politics with a small p includes not only institutional politics, but also personal politics: the motivation of the actors themselves <b>and</b> their <b>agendas.</b> <b>And</b> personal politics can influence language education both in day-to-day affairs, and in projects for innovation and change” (Alderson 2009, p. 3).|$|R
5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of Kraków's president include drafting and implementing resolutions, enacting city bylaws, managing the city budget, employing city administrators, and preparing against floods and natural disasters. The president fulfills his duties {{with the help}} of the City Council, city managers and city inspectors. In the 1990s, the city government was reorganised to better differentiate between its political <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> administrative functions. As a result, the Office of Public Information was created to handle inquiries and foster communication between city departments and citizens at large.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Diệm and the {{execution}} of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary counter-insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes. In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist <b>agenda,</b> <b>and</b> the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians {{in an attempt to}} have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1915 and June 1916, Bogdan-Pitești managed another press venue, Libertatea ("Freedom"). Its {{political}} director was retired statesman Nicolae Fleva, later replaced by Arghezi. In February 1916, Galaction and Arghezi launched Cronica, another review with a pro-German <b>agenda,</b> <b>and</b> which may itself {{have been published}} with discreet assistance from Bogdan-Pitești. Although Bogdan-Pitești, Domnica and Caragiale paid a mysterious visit to Berlin in early 1916, they were never listed as foreign spies by Siguranța Statului counter-intelligence. Bogdan-Pitești's name then surfaced in a February 1916 conversation between German statesman Matthias Erzberger and Raymund Netzhammer, the Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest. Erzberger asked if the Vlaici landowner could ever help advance the Germanophile cause; the Archbishop, a loyal German subject, replied that Bogdan-Pitești was unreliable. Allegations later surfaced that Bogdan-Pitești {{was one of the}} men receiving payoffs from the German spy Albert E. Günther, manager of Steaua Română company. The dossier attesting this was lost, but secondary sources have it that Bogdan-Pitești alone received 840,000 lei from Günther's hands.|$|E
