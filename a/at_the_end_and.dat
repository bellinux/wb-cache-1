5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an {{addition}} to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{had hoped}} to start filming in March 2002, but {{production}} did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers.|$|E
5|$|Spore {{prints are}} dark brown, {{sometimes}} with violet shades. Spores are thick-walled with an apical pore, and elongated ellipsoid to equilateral in face view, and somewhat inequilateral in side view, typically measuring 12.0–12.6–13.1 by 6.8–7.1–7.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, four-spored with sterigmata up to 5.5μm long, and have dimensions of 27–37 by 9–11μm. Clamp connections {{are present in}} hyphae. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant. They are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, and variably shaped, and range from narrow clubs to narrow flasks with a neck no longer than 8μm; their dimensions are typically 20–30 by 6–8μm. The pleurocystidia (found on the gill face) are common; they are broadly club-shaped but taper to a point (sometimes with a rounded tip <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end),</b> <b>and</b> measure 25–35 by 9–14μm. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are also present, with variable shapes similar to the cheilo- and pleurocystidia.|$|E

5|$|The Stadio San Paolo was {{the only}} stadium during the {{competition}} where the Argentine National Anthem was not jeered, Maradona bowed to the Napoli fans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> his country went on to reach the final. However, after the final, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) forced Maradona to take a doping test, which he failed testing positive for cocaine; both Maradona and Napoli staff later claimed it was a revenge plot for events at the World Cup. Maradona was banned for 15 months and would never play for the club again. The club still managed to win the Supercoppa Italiana that year, with a record 5–1 victory against Juventus, {{but it would be}} their last major trophy for 22 years. However, in the European Cup, they were eliminated in the second round.|$|E
5|$|The hot {{and humid}} {{conditions}} in Nanning slowed the runners' pace and twelve of them remained within the main pack by the 10km point. The following five kilometres was decisive for the race, as Samuel Tsegay, Titus Masai and Mosop were all left trailing. The leading four runners were soon reduced to three, as Kipruto fell away to leave Zersenay Tadese, Wilson Kiprop and Sammy Kitwara to battle for the medal positions. Zersenay and Kiprop were neck and neck in the lead from the last kilometre and it was Kiprop who pulled away in the final 100metres to break the Eritrean's four-year undefeated streak. Zersenay faded badly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> appeared injured after taking second place. Kitwara and Kipruto were third and fourth, sealing the Kenyan team victory, while Samuel Tsegay's fifth place helped Eritrea to the team silver.|$|E
5|$|Tidus makes few {{appearances}} in {{the plot of the}} 2003 sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, Yuna sees a sphere with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the hope of finding more clues that Tidus is alive. The individual in the sphere is later revealed as Shuyin. Depending on the player's development during the game, the fayth will appear to Yuna <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> tell her that they can make Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an unlockable character as Star Player, a blitzball player. In Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play-through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. An illusion of Tidus also appears as a boss character.|$|E

25|$|This {{suggests}} the following pattern: each iteration is formed {{by taking the}} previous iteration, adding an R <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> then taking the original iteration again, flipping it retrograde, swapping each letter and adding the result after the R. Due to the self-similarity exhibited by the Heighway dragon, this effectively means each successive iteration adds {{a copy of the}} last iteration rotated counter-clockwise to the fractal.|$|E
25|$|Lectionary 183, {{designated}} by siglum ℓ 183 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering) is a Greek manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment, written in uncial letters.

25|$|Third {{and most}} {{important}} match in the group came against England. England batted first and scored 171/4 with Jos Buttler's magnificent fifty. Sri Lanka in the chase, again looked so poor, where 50 runs for 5 wickets after 9 overs. The defending champions were {{on the brink of}} a huge defeat in the match, Angelo Mathews came to the crease. He with Kapugedera smashed England spinner in all corners where the match went down to the wire at the end. With falling wickets in regular intervals, Sri Lanka lost the match by 10 runs at the end, where skipper Mathews played a gem of an innings with a hamstring injury. But his 54 ball 73 was not enough <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> Sri Lanka along with South Africa were eliminated from the World Twenty20.|$|E
25|$|As the war looked {{increasingly}} {{bad for the}} allies, {{with the}} impending German conquest of Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, Mussolini could no longer hold himself back and declared war on the allies on 10 June 1940. To Mussolini {{it seemed that the}} war was already nearly over, and {{he wanted to make sure}} that Italy at least got a position at the peace tables <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> obtained such lands as Corsica, Nice, and more North African territory. The Italian offensive against France did not actually begin until ten days after the declaration of war, and Italian troops (fighting against a numerically inferior French force, which was however well-entrenched in the Alpine Line) were very slow to capture territory, while Germany had already taken hold of Paris. By 25 June, the armistice with France had already been arranged, though Italian troops made only insignificant progress into French territory, advancing of few kilometers and suffering exceedingly heavy casualties.|$|E
25|$|Each {{individual}} {{has a family}} deity, called Kula dewa, who resides in the temple called the family temple that the individual and his family patronize. Balinese Hindu follow a 210-day calendar (based on rice crop and lunar cycles), and each temple celebrates its anniversary once every 210 days. Unique rituals and festivals of Balinese Hindus, that are not found in India, include those related to death {{of a loved one}} followed by cremations, cockfights, tooth filings, Nyepi and Galungan. Each temple anniversary, as well as festivals and family events such as wedding include flowers, offerings, towering bamboos with decoration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> a procession. These are celebrated by the community with prayers and feast. Most festivals have a temple as venue, and they are often occasions for prayers, celebration of arts and community. Some traditions, in contrast, involve animist rituals such as caru (animal blood sacrifice) such as Tabuh Rah (lethal cockfighting) or killing of an animal to appease buta kala (spirits of the earth) - however, the animal sacrifices are conducted outside the premises of a temple.|$|E

500|$|Because of its {{extended}} conversations, intricate {{descriptions and}} lengthy asides, {{the book is}} considered [...] "heavy" [...] by some critics. In later editions its chapter breaks were removed (though some versions now restore them), and the work is in three sections – the final of which comprises nearly half the novel. The novel's feel {{is compounded by the}} lack of clarity on some points; some characters' motives are unclear even <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> the chaotic sequence of events is difficult to track.|$|E
