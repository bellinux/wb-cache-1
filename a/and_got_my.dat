2500|$|Although {{claiming}} [...] "we all {{helped put}} the album together", Q-Tip {{was the only}} Tribe Called Quest member present at every recording session. Group member Phife Dawg later admitted [...] "I was being ignorant on that first album, that’s why I was only {{on a couple of}} tracks. I was hardly around. I would have rather hung out with my boys on the street <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> hustle on rather than gone in the studio. I wasn’t even on the contract for the first album. I was thinking me and Jarobi were more like back-ups for Tip and Ali, but Tip and Ali really wanted me to come through and do my thing".|$|E
2500|$|During {{a period}} of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: [...] "You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold myself by two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> money back. But for this once, I could say I never was bought {{in my life and}} this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often I must have been accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the {{disappointed}} betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ".|$|E

6000|$|... "I shan't spend money," [...] said Griffenbottom; [...] "it's {{out of the}} question. They can't touch me. I've {{spent my}} money, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> article. If others want the article, they must spend theirs." ...|$|E

60|$|GILBEY. I want {{none of your}} gaiety here. This is {{a respectable}} household. Youve gone <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> poor {{innocent}} boy into trouble. It's the like of you thats the ruin of the like of him.|$|E
60|$|I {{sorted out}} my various cans and tins, tested {{the oil in}} my chronometer, {{arranged}} in neat order my various ropes and apparatus, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> frying-pan into readiness for any emergency. Of food we had for the present no lack.|$|E
60|$|I turned <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> hat; Glendenning {{came in for}} his, {{but seemed}} unable to find it, though he stood before the table where it lay. I had to laugh, though I felt so little like it, as I {{put it in his}} hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I {{have made a}} mistake, Mr. Jennings, <b>and</b> have <b>got</b> <b>my</b> card mixed up. Do you mind taking the thirteenth dance instead of this? I shall be very much obliged if you will." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I ... I think...." [...] {{he began}} hesitantly. [...] "No; by George, I'm sure of it. We used to hunt cottontails over that ground, and shoot {{blackbirds}} in the brush. And there, where the bank building is, was a pond." [...] He turned to Polly. [...] "I built my first raft there, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> {{first taste of}} the sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, last night. He {{was in the}} barn, and {{he jumped}} out at my wife {{and said he was}} going to blow the fort to pieces! She got so scared she dropped her pailful of milk and ran to the house. I got mad <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> shotgun, but the fellow had skipped out before I could catch sight of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Deuce {{take the}} man!' cried Mrs Gamp, drawing it forth. 'If he ain't been <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> night-bottle here.

60|$|We wasted {{a little}} time in vague discussion. Then I {{took one of the}} bars in both hands, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> feet up against the rock until they were almost on a level with my head, and so thrust against the bar. It bent so {{suddenly}} that I almost slipped. I clambered about and bent the adjacent bar in the opposite direction, and then took the luminous fungus from my pocket and dropped it down the fissure.|$|E
60|$|These {{two years}} and three months were the most active ones which I ever spent, though I was {{occasionally}} unwell, and so lost some time. After going backwards and forwards several times between Shrewsbury, Maer, Cambridge, and London, I settled in lodgings at Cambridge (In Fitzwilliam Street.) on December 13th, where all my collections were {{under the care of}} Henslow. I stayed here three months, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> minerals and rocks examined by the aid of Professor Miller.|$|E
6000|$|I {{dropped a}} nickel {{out of the}} window <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> paper; the Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change; is around the corner yet. It was delicious to see a {{newspaper}} again, yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display head-lines. I had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence, respect, deference, so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave through me: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, it was Ross. He {{was serving}} in the regular army at the time. He has told me since that he felt no fear whatever. 'Uncle Sam's blue coat was like Siegfried's magic armor,' he said; 'it {{was the kind of}} thing the mounted police of Canada had been called upon to do many a time, and I went in <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> men.' That ended the war, so far as violent {{measures}} went, and it really ended the sovereignty of the cattle-man. The power of the 'nester' has steadily increased from that moment." ...|$|E
60|$|To see {{her with}} her white hair and her worn face {{kneeling}} at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and wept. I {{had never seen her}} shed a tear before, and, {{in the hope that the}} relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was not kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.|$|E
60|$|We {{have had}} two northers and the water grew so cold that it drove the fish out. The {{last two or three}} days have been warm and to-day it was hot. However, I did not expect the {{bonefish}} in yet, and when we went in bathing at flood-tide I was very glad to see two fish. I hurried out <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> rod and began to try. Presently I had a little strike. I waited and it was repeated; then I jerked and felt the fish. He made a wave {{and that was the last}} I knew of him.|$|E
