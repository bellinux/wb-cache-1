In a medium irradiated with low LET radiation the spurs are sparsely distributed across the track and are unable to interact.

At 298 K, X-band microwave frequencies ( [...] ≈ 9.75GHz) give [...] ≈ 0.998, meaning that the upper energy level has a slightly smaller population than the lower one.

2500|$|At room temperature, {{most of the}} {{molecules}} {{will be in the}} lowest energy state, which is known as the ground state. [...] A few molecules will be in higher energy states, which are known as excited states.

2500|$|Experimentally, this {{equation}} permits a large combination of frequency and magnetic field values, {{but the great}} majority of EPR measurements are made with microwaves in the 9000–10000MHz (9–10GHz) region, with fields corresponding to about 3500 G (0.35 T). Furthermore, EPR spectra can be generated by either varying the photon frequency incident on a sample while holding the magnetic field constant or doing the reverse. In practice, it is usually the frequency that is kept fixed. A collection of paramagnetic centers, such as free radicals, is exposed to microwaves at a fixed frequency. By increasing an external magnetic field, the gap between the [...] and [...] energy states is widened until it matches the energy of the microwaves, as represented by the double arrow in the diagram above. At this point the unpaired electrons can move between their two spin states. Since there typically are more electrons in the lower state, due to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (see below), there is a net <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> and it is this absorption that is monitored and converted into a spectrum. The upper spectrum below is the simulated absorption for a system of free electrons in a varying magnetic field. The lower spectrum is the first derivative of the absorption spectrum. The latter is the most common way to record and publish continuous wave EPR spectra.|$|E

General Francisco de Miranda of Venezuela, who had been attracting support for revolutionary activities as early as 1797, offered a canal concession to Britain in return for aid.
