50|$|In mortgages, an <b>attornment</b> <b>clause</b> is {{a clause}} whereby the {{mortgagor}} attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee {{the right to}} distrain, as an additional security. As used in modern legal transactions, the term attornment refers to an acknowledgment {{of the existence of}} the relationship of landlord and tenant. A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an attornment upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing encumbrances on and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the due diligence process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the attornment is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.|$|E
