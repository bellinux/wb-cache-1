5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E
5|$|King Faysal, who {{recently}} returned to Iraq {{from a medical}} vacation, was very stressed during the crisis. His health deteriorated even more during the hot summer days in Baghdad. The British chargé d'affaires met him in his pajamas squatting in his bed on 15 August, where he denied that a massacre was committed in Simele. Faysal left Iraq again on 2 September 1933, seeking <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> climate in London, where he died five days later.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{within the}} park is at an {{elevation}} of about , and the park itself sits in a natural basin. The basin and the underlying sandstone trap water and thus form the lake and surrounding bogs. The higher elevation leads to <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> climate, and the basin helps trap denser, cooler air, leading to longer winters and milder summers.|$|E

5|$|Floatovoltaics are an {{emerging}} form of PV systems that float {{on the surface}} of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> temperature than they would be on land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Inga {{accelerated}} somewhat as {{it passed}} to the southeast of Bermuda. By the morning hours of October 5, {{it was determined that}} the hurricane posed no significant threat to the island. At 1200 UTC, the storm's lowest known barometric pressure of 964 millibars was recorded. Shortly thereafter, it briefly strengthened to Category 3 status; the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). As it moved towards the open waters of the Atlantic and entered <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> environment, it deteriorated to Category 1 intensity on October 6. The hurricane slowed again, and as cold air became entrained into its circulation, it began to lose tropical characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1934 The {{object of}} this study was to compare the {{efficiency}} of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> with that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler, as well as with that of two other coolers (tub cooler and sprinkler cooler). The <b>cooling</b> efficiency of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> was slightly lower than that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler. The <b>cooling</b> efficiency of <b>a</b> sprinkler <b>cooler</b> was found to be higher than that of <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler,</b> but the cooling efficiency of either one of these two coolers was considerably lower than that of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler.</b> When <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> and <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> were thoroughly cleaned and sterilized there was no difference of' practical significance in the bacterial contamination of the milk by these two coolers. The flavor and odor of milk <b>cooled</b> with <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or with <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> was on <b>an</b> average slightly superior to the flavor and odor of milk from the same lot which was <b>cooled</b> with <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler</b> or with <b>a</b> sprinkler <b>cooler.</b> No difference was observed in the volume of cream forming on milk from the same lot when the milk was <b>cooled</b> with <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or with <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> or when it was not cooled.

5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in <b>a</b> <b>cooler.</b> He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span {{a period of}} over 9000years. The artifacts were disposed {{in a manner that}} permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy, as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied {{near the end of the}} Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> climate from about 1000BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird {{visitors}} to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to damping off. Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> conditions (due either to latitude or altitude) can delay flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth of leaves and branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and has done well in cultivation in England. The Royal Horticultural Society gave it an Award of Merit in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on Mount Wellington.|$|E

5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|On December7, 2011, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), {{a public}} {{consortium}} consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast predicting an above-average hurricane season. In its report, TSR noted that tropical cyclone activity could be about 49% above the 1950–2010 average, with 14.1 (±4.2) tropical storms, 6.7 (±3.0) hurricanes, and 3.3 (±1.6) major hurricanes anticipated, and a cumulative ACE index of 117 (±58). Later that month on December21, Weather Services International (WSI) issued an extended-range forecast predicting a near average hurricane season. In its forecast, WSI noted that <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> North Atlantic Oscillation {{not seen in}} a decade, combined with weakening La Niña, {{would result in a}} near-average season with 12named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. They also predicted a near-average probability of a hurricane landfall, with a slightly elevated chance on the Gulf Coast of the United States and a slightly reduced chance along the East Coast of the United States. On April 4, 2012, Colorado State University (CSU) issued their updated forecast for the season, calling for a below-normal season due to an increased chance for the development of an El Niño during the season. In April 2012, TSR issued their update forecast for the season, slightly revising down their predictions as well.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2005, the mobile-game {{publisher}} Gameloft {{announced that}} they would bring Meteos and Q Entertainment's other puzzle game, Lumines, to cell phones. The game was released on March 30, 2006, as Meteos Astro Blocks. In 2006, Buena Vista Games announced they would publish four Q Entertainment games, including the then-unannounced Meteos: Disney Magic for the Nintendo DS. A sequel to Meteos, Meteos: Disney Magic, developed by Platinum Egg and Aspect Co., follows Meteos basic concept {{with a number of}} changes—most notably, replacing the game's alien species with Disney characters. The Nintendo DS was held sideways, creating a taller playing field on the touchscreen. Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Jack Sparrow, and Winnie the Pooh are featured in the game, whose plot involves restoring order in the storybook vault after its contents are mysteriously rearranged. A significant change in gameplay was the ability to drag tiles left and right; in Meteos, tiles could only be moved up and down. Meteos: Disney Magic was released in North America on February 22, 2007, and in Europe on June 1. It had <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> reception than its predecessor, with a score of 74 out of 100 from Metacritic. Phil Theobald, who also reviewed the first Meteos, while enjoying Disney Magic, thought that the lowered difficulty made it less fun.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in <b>a</b> <b>cooler</b> climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E
