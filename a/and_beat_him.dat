5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca <b>and</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E

Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, <b>and</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him.</b> In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E

Booker T and Roode then fought at Against All Odds to a double count-out.

On the February 28, 2008, episode of Impact!, Roode handcuffed Booker T to the ring ropes <b>and</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> with a belt, until Roode's former manager Ms. Brooks, now Traci Brooks, came to Booker T's defense.

Orme started the 4/5 favourite, and with two furlongs to run he {{strode into the}} lead.

The next day he won the Subscription Stakes easily from Porridge, after leading from the start and never being caught. He raced again the next day, his third race in as many days, in a Free Handicap Sweepstakes over ten furlongs where he faced five opponents. Orme started as the 4/6 favourite, Bushey Park was at 5/1. Next in the betting came El Diablo, The Lover and Therapia all priced at 100/12. Bushey Park led {{in the early stages}} until Orme went into the lead with about two furlongs left to run.

Orme had to carry 16 pounds more weight than El Diablo and 22 pounds more than The Lover.|$|E
5|$|John Wilkes Booth had {{originally}} planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell. Having found {{no opportunity to}} abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three {{senior members of the}} Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped {{at the top of the}} stairs by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, <b>and</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) to one side, and jumped on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.|$|E
