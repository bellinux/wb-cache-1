40|$|Located in the sub-Antarctic, Marion Island (46 &#x 00 B 0; 54 &#x 2032; S, 37 &#x 00 B 0; 45 &#x 2032; E) has a {{distinct}} periglacial environment that is sensitive to climate change. Diurnal soil frost {{is the most important}} geomorphic process occurring on the island and this paper aims to understand the synoptic weather circulation pattern associated with summer soil frost occurrence in a sub-Antarctic environment. Preliminary results from automated microclimate measurements in the interior of Marion Island show that summer soil frost is dependent on <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> circulation. This occurs exclusively during post-cyclonic airflow after the passage of a cold front connected to a mid-latitudinal cyclone and subsequent ridging in of the South Atlantic Anticyclone behind the cold front, or when a series of low pressure systems passes over the island. The duration and intensity of soil frost cycles are dependent on the duration of post-cyclonic <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> circulation. Summer soil frost on Marion Island is driven by a complex interaction between the latitudinal position of the passing cyclone, the latitudinal position of the ridging anticyclone as well as the trajectory of the air mass circulation. The data suggest that predicted trends in synoptic climate change in the sub-Antarctic may lead to non-linear responses in soil frost dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{climate of}} Marion Island {{is driven by}} {{synoptic}} weather patterns which have also been suggested to influence the soil thermal characteristics. The primary aim of this work {{was to examine the}} effect of synoptic weather systems on soil temperature dynamics on an altitudinal gradient on the eastern side of Marion Island. The study specifically addresses the implications of climate change on future soil thermal dynamics in a maritime sub-Antarctic environment. Ground temperature were obtained from three ground temperature monitoring stations on the eastern side of Marion Island, which were established along an altitudinal gradient at Long Ridge North (200 m a. s. l.), Katedraalkrans (750 m a. s. l) and at Delta Extension (1000 m a. s. l.). To assess the synoptic weather circulation patterns, a synoptic climate classification methodology that is based on the single station principal component (PCA) and cluster analysis were used. Results show that certain clusters were more dominant than others and over the measured time span certain synoptic weather patterns, mainly cyclonic air circulation types, have decreased while anticyclonic circulation have increased. Soil frost occurs at all three stations on Marion Island, not only under cyclonic circulations (as previously suggested) but significantly under anticyclonic air mass circulation as well. Soil frost is dependent on the duration of post-cyclonic <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> circulation. Synoptic weather patterns are also affecting ground surface lapse rates. Changes from positive to negative lapse rates were observed and this predominantly occurred under the atmospheric circulation pattern associated with clusters that are predominantly anticyclonic. Long term climatic change as predicted by the PCA show a reduction in low pressure systems or more anticyclonic conditions affecting the island. These change will significantly affect the soil thermal dynamics at an altitudinal scale on sub-Antarctic Marion Island...|$|E

During El Niño events, the atmospheric ENSO effect leads to a shift and weakening of the Amundsen Sea Low, causing enhanced import of colder West <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> into the western Ross Sea.

40|$|There is {{much debate}} over the source of bromine {{radicals}} in the atmosphere that drives polar boundary layer ozone depletion events (ODEs), but there is strong evidence to suggest a source associated with the sea ice zone. Here we report the first high temporal resolution measurements of Br 2, BrCl and BrO in coastal Antarctica, made using a Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (CIMS). Mixing ratios ranged from instrumental detection limits to 13 pptv for BrO, 45 pptv for Br 2, and 6 pptv for BrCl. We find evidence for blowing snow {{as a source of}} reactive bromine both directly during a storm and subsequently from recycling of bromide deposited on the continental snowpack. An unusual event of trans-continental <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> transport might have been responsible for severe surface ozone depletion observed at Halley. The halogen source region was the Bellingshausen Sea, {{to the west of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula, the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> having spent 3 1 / 2 days in complete darkness prior to arrival at Halley. We, further, identify an artefact in daytime BrCl measurements arising from conversion of HOBr, similar to that already identified for CIMS observations of Br 2. Model calculations using the MISTRA 0 -D model suggest a 50 – 60 % conversion of HOBr to Br 2, and 5 – 10 % conversion to BrCl. Careful data filtering enabled us to use the halogen observations, in conjunction with the MISTRA model, to explore the temperature dependence of the Br 2 :BrCl ratio. We find evidence of a ratio shift towards Br 2 at temperatures below ~− 21 °C, suggesting a relationship with hydrohalite (NaCl. 2 H 2 O) precipitation.

40|$|Seismic {{reflection}} and refraction data provide {{insights into the}} sedimentary infill and the underlying volcanic structure of Laguna Potrok Aike, a maar lake situated in the Pali Aike Volcanic Field, Southern Patagonia. The lake has a diameter of ~ 3. 5 km, a maximum water depth of ~ 100 m and a presumed age of ~ 770 ka. Its sedimentary regime is influenced by climatic and hydrologic conditions related to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Southern Hemispheric Westerlies and sporadic outbreaks of <b>Antarctic</b> polar <b>air</b> <b>masses.</b> Multiproxy environmental reconstructions of the last 16 ka document that this terminal lake is highly sensitive to climate change. Laguna Potrok Aike has recently become {{a major focus of}} the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program and was drilled down to 100 m below lake floor in late 2008 within the PASADO project. The sediments are likely to contain a continental record spanning the last ca. 80 kyrs unique in the South American realm. Seismic reflection data show relatively undisturbed, stratified lacustrine sediments at least in the upper ~ 100 m of the sedimentary infill but are obscured possibly by gas and/or coarser material in larger areas. A model calculated from seismic refraction data reveals a funnel-shaped structure embedded in the sandstone rocks of the surrounding Santa Cruz Formation. This funnel structure is filled by lacustrine sediments of up to 370 m in thickness. These can be separated into two distinct subunits with low acoustic velocities of 1500 - 1800 m s- 1 in the upper subunit pointing at unconsolidated lacustrine muds, and enhanced velocities of 2000 - 2350 m s- 1 in the lower subunit. Below these lacustrine sediments, a unit of probably volcanoclastic origin is observed (> 2400 m s- 1). This sedimentary succession is well comparable to other well-studied sequences (e. g. Messel and Baruth maars, Germany), confirming phreatomagmatic maar explosions as the origin of Laguna Potrok Aike...|$|R
