That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an <b>affordable</b> <b>price.</b> Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated.

She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

Its power was ample for the time and class, allowing it to pull a two-bottom plow.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{business model}} for video rental stores had traditionally been {{to pay a}} large flat fee per video, approximately $65, and offer unlimited rentals for the lifetime of the medium itself. Sumner Redstone, whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept a 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through Rentrak. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized {{on the fact that}} movies were generally not available for purchase at <b>affordable</b> <b>price</b> points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher manufacturer's suggested retail price targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70–$100 per title.|$|E

25|$|The Secretariat of Communications and Transport of Mexico {{proposed}} a high-speed rail link that would transport passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco, with {{stops in the}} cities of Querétaro, Guanajuato, Leon and Irapuato; and a connected line running from {{the port city of}} Manzanillo to Aguascalientes. The train which would travel at 300km/h allows passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2hours at an <b>affordable</b> <b>price</b> (the same trip by road would last 7hours).

25|$|By 1960, {{the shoes}} {{designed}} by Roger Vivier for Dior {{were made at}} Rayne's UK factory and personally supervised by Edward Rayne. Four years later, Vivier began selling Rayne brand shoes in his Rue François store in Paris. The company also stayed in tune with mainstream direction of fashion – Mary Quant shoes were first displayed in its flagship store. The company also retained {{a stake in the}} mass market, with an interest in both H.E. Randall and Lotus chainstores. By 1966, Rayne was showcasing what were known as 'Young Design quartet' – Jean Muir, Roger Nelson, Moya Bowler and Gerald McCann – capitalising on London's thirst for younger designers by getting them to design fashionable shoes in a more <b>affordable</b> <b>price</b> bracket, with designs being sold in Harrods and some high-street shoe shops. Rayne also maintained a strong foothold in the couture end of shoe production – indeed his role as chair of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers from 1960 meant his shoes were shown as part of the twice annual fashion events held by the society. He also enlisted designers such as Norman Hartnell to create shoes for Rayne.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} classical Ethiopian Semitic language Ge'ez by having phrasal verbs {{and using a}} word-order that places the main verb last instead of first in the sentence. There is a strong Ge'ez influence on Tigrinya literature, especially with terms that relate to Christian life, Biblical names, and so on. Ge'ez, because of its status within Ethiopian culture, acted as a literary medium until relatively recent times. Aside from Ge’ez, Tigrinya itself has had development into the press as the language was incorporated in a ministry newspaper that was published by the British administration of Eritrea. It sold 5000 copies weekly and was at the <b>affordable</b> <b>price</b> of five cents and it {{was reported to be}} {{the first of its kind}} in the region. However, The earliest written example of Tigrinya is a text of local laws found in Logosarda district, Southern Region, Eritrea and in northern Ethiopia, which dates from the 13th century during the reign of the Zagwe dynasty. However, the phonology of the Tigrinya language along with the morphology still strongly shows the connection to the predecessor language of Ge'ez while the connection also displays Tigriniya's semitic character.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the social welfare {{implications of the}} European and American definition of <b>affordable</b> <b>prices</b> when a country is divided into independent zones. We find that the European definition is always soc ial welfare superior, because it forces to keep lower prices. We also introduce to new defintions of <b>affordable</b> <b>prices.</b> The first definition advocates for a common price for the unprofitable area. We prove that this definition is social welfare superior to the current definitions. In the second definition denote as "yardstick pricing", we define the <b>affordable</b> <b>prices</b> for the unprofitable areas as a function that does not depende on their own zone profitable area price. We show that yardstick price is more efficient for social welfare when the differences in demand among zones are not very large. ...|$|R

Sonically, it benefited from a design error where crosstalk between left and right channels presented better detail and more ambiance; the error was corrected in a later guise. Its sound is described by reviewers as dark and warm, with a [...] "sweet and sensual midrange"; some reviewers observed a very noticeable rolling off at frequency extremes that may detract from sonic neutrality, and that its soundstage lacked precision but it was universally praised for its value for money. The amplifier was a hot seller, and the [...] alone achieved a record 1.1 million units in its lifetime. The figure would be much higher if the sales of other amplifiers derived directly from its design are included. The quality made possible at a £79 (US$133) price tag opened up the market for budget yet quality amplifiers, and spawned similarly low-priced competitors such as ARCAM Alpha, Rotel 840, Mission , Pioneer A400, Denon [...] and Marantz [...] In 2002 it ranked No. 19 in list of [...] "The Hot 100 Products" [...] by Stereophile.
