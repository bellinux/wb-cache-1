5|$|Gravitational waves, {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> {{and can be}} thought of as ripples in spacetime. They should not be confused with the gravity waves of fluid dynamics, which are a different concept.|$|E
5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E

5|$|In modern quantum physics, the {{electromagnetic}} field {{is described by}} the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of {{the electromagnetic}} field, called photons. In QED, photons are massless particles and thus, according to special relativity, they travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in vacuum.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} light has become {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the {{speed of light}} in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> through glass.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, {{the data from the}} camera was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority over the use of the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
