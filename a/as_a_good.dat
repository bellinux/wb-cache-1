5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> middle ground between the two releases.|$|E
5|$|As Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting {{was seen}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> choice by {{business}} and the middle class. While he was Chancellor inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target causing the Governor of the Bank of England to write several letters to the Chancellor, each time inflation exceeded three per cent.|$|E
5|$|Collier was well-liked by {{players and}} renowned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sportsman and {{student of the}} game. The Kentucky chapter of the NFL Players Association in 2007 {{established}} the Blanton Collier Award in his honor. The Paris High School football field is named after him.|$|E
25|$|Curzon Street {{railway station}} {{was a major}} railway station during the 19th century and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> station with another {{terminus}} opposite. Unfortunately, it was located {{too far from the}} city centre and it was not successful. It failed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> passenger station and shut down in 1966 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> station.|$|R
50|$|After {{closure to}} {{passengers}} the station remained in use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> station until 1964. The station area included an engine shed which was opened on 28 April 1847, extended in 1858 and closed in 1876, after {{which it was}} converted for use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> shed. The shed was demolished in the mid-1990s.|$|R

5|$|The {{definition}} of the two sets is thus a historic one. Out of pure coincidence, the phoneme inventory of present-day colloquial Sinhala is such that yet again the śuddha alphabet suffices <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> representation of the sounds.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ceciliae is {{considered}} an edible mushroom and used as food, although many field guides recommend to avoid eating it. Others recommend it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> edible species. A study of 16 edible mushrooms was done to learn about their chemical compositions and antioxidant activities. Among these species, A.ceciliae and Pleurotus ostreatus were the two mushrooms that showed most powerful radical scavenging activities.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
50|$|Although {{closed to}} passengers, the site remains in use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> yard.|$|R
50|$|After {{the opening}} of Paragon station the old station was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> station. Expansion was soon {{required}} and land including the old Gaol (west of Manor House Street) and houses on Bell Vue Terrace were acquired and demolished and the station expanded. In 1858 the existing buildings were demolished and the site redeveloped in one piece <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> station.|$|R

5|$|Brown's {{first year}} at Ohio State was a success. The Buckeyes won {{all but one of}} eight games in 1941; the only loss was to Northwestern University and its star tailback, Otto Graham. The final game of the season was a 20–20 tie with Michigan, which the school's {{supporters}} saw <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> outcome given that Ohio State was a heavy underdog. The Buckeyes tied for second place in the Western Conference, a grouping of college teams from the Midwestern United States (now known as the Big Ten), and finished 13th in the AP Poll. Brown was fourth in balloting for national Coach of the Year.|$|E
5|$|By 1827, Protestant Christianity, and in {{particular}} Bingham's teachings, had become the de facto state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Queen Kaʻahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, by, for example, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize. In December1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave on a ship, the Waverly, bound for North America. Though Queen Kaʻahumanu steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E

5|$|Charles Ebbets, {{owner of}} the Brooklyn Dodgers, viewed Tinker <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{replacement}} for the released Bob Fisher, their shortstop in 1913. The Cubs, Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies were also interested in acquiring Tinker. Ebbets secured Tinker's release from the Reds for $15,000, with another $10,000 {{to be paid to}} Tinker. The teams also agreed to swap players, with Earl Yingling and Herbie Moran going to Cincinnati and Dick Egan joining Brooklyn. Ebbets entered contract negotiations with Tinker.|$|E
5|$|Ernest learned cavalry {{drill and}} tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons, and {{proved to be}} an {{excellent}} horseman as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> shot. After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood cinematographer who {{had been}} an auto {{mechanic}} and early aviator. Fleming had {{become involved in the}} film industry when a friend, Marshall Neilan, recommended Fleming to film director Allan Dwan <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mechanic. (Fleming impressed Dwan by quickly fixing both his car and a faulty film camera.) By 1916, Fleming had become a cinematographer.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example of a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have}} been financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Gutawa voiced a {{character}} in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia. She considered it challenging; for the most difficult part, {{a scene in which}} she had to cry, she practised in front of a mirror. In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.|$|E
5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His appointment was swiftly confirmed when Congress convened that March. The appointment was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one, but many in Washington {{soon began to}} question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength and intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the suggestion was ignored.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing, Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> officer.|$|E
5|$|Itachi's Japanese voice actor, Hideo Ishikawa, often {{talked with}} Sasuke's Japanese actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, about their {{characters}}. When the two characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre of the Uchiha clan {{hard to believe}} and started to read the Naruto manga {{in order to see}} if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors noted that in the end Itachi served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> old brother to Sasuke. English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of how many times he revisited the series.|$|E
