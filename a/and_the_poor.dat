5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of offending Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the key {{difference}} lies in {{the contrast between the}} stable, flexible government of Australia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E
5|$|Hugh died on 7 February 1235, at his episcopal {{residence}} at Stow Park. He was buried on 10 February 1235 in Lincoln Cathedral, {{in the north}} aisle. In 1233 he had written a new will, which mentions his brother and a niece named Agatha. He left bequests to his family, his household, Lincoln Cathedral, {{and a number of}} monasteries in his diocese. What was left after the specific legacies was to be divided between poor religious houses, such as the Barrow Gurney Nunnery, students and teachers at Oxford University, Jewish converts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> on the episcopal manors.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
5|$|Life for the {{ordinary}} {{soldiers of the}} garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered {{for even the most}} trivial offences.

5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls.

5|$|Trimmer {{was also}} an active philanthropist. She founded several Sunday schools and charity schools in her parish.

5|$|Trimmer's {{works are}} {{dedicated}} to maintaining {{many aspects of the}} social and political status quo. As a high church Anglican, she was intent on promoting the established Church of England and on teaching young children <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> the doctrines of Christianity. Her writings outlined the benefits of social hierarchy, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. Yet, while supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and the family.|$|E

5|$|Although Æthelwig {{was known}} for his loyalty to King William, he had an uncle who held land at Witton who died {{fighting}} for King Harold Godwinson, probably at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. While abbot, even after the Conquest, Æthelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the Anglo-Saxon style, not the Norman Romanesque which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys. Besides his administrative and legal duties, Æthelwig {{was known for}} his care for the sick <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> as well as lepers. After the Harrying of the North by King William in 1069–1070, Æthelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas. The Chronicon states that Æthelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, but it is possible that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Institutional {{financial}} self-sufficiency (IFS) {{is necessary for}} a microfinance institution (MFI) to obtain {{the large amount of}} funds required to reach and benefit truly large numbers of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> poorest households. There is no necessary trade-off between serving large numbers of <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> households <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attainment of IFS by an MFI, as proven by the case studies in this paper. Cost-effective identification of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> women is essential to maximizing <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>and</b> efficiency of providing microfinance services to them. If the service is not exclusively for <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest,</b> it should be operated separately for them to minimize leakage to the nonpoor. The total cost of efficient microcredit to <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> i. e., <b>the</b> appro-priate interest rate, will vary between 35 % and 51 % of their average loans outstanding, depending on the conditions under which it is pro-vided, <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> quality of the loan portfolio...|$|R
5|$|As the Byzantines {{relied upon}} the Ghassanids {{to cover the}} {{approaches}} to Syria, Mundhir's withdrawal left {{a gap in the}} Byzantine southern flank, which persisted for three years until 575 when Mundhir returned to the Byzantine allegiance through the mediation of the general Justinian, who met Mundhir at Sergiopolis. Immediately after this reconciliation, Mundhir assembled an army in secret and launched an attack against Hirah, the Lakhmid capital, arguably the Arab world's largest, richest, and most culturally vibrant city at the time. The city was sacked, plundered, and put to the torch, except for the churches. According to John of Ephesus, Mundhir donated much of his booty from this expedition to monasteries <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> The same year, Mundhir visited Constantinople, where he was awarded a crown or diadem (stemma), marking the formal renewal of his role as Byzantium's chief Arab client-king.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
