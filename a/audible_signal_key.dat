40|$|Real-world tagging technologies, such as RFID or visual codes, {{have enabled}} new {{application}} scenarios that foster mobile {{interaction with the}} physical world.

Users can activate an <b>audible</b> <b>signal</b> based on a pre-selection of available tags (pull) or choose to be constantly informed about nearby tags (push).
