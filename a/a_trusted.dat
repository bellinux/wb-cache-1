5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Documents with {{accounts}} of the battle include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the writings of Anglo-Norman historian William of Malmesbury and the Annals of Clonmacnoise. In Snorri Sturluson's Egils saga, the antihero, mercenary, berserker and skald, Egill Skallagrimsson, served as <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> warrior for Æthelstan. It {{has been suggested that}} the account in Egil's Saga is unreliable. Sagas have more than once placed their hero in a famous battle and then embellished it with a series of literary mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Following the restoration, William Bruce was {{appointed}} Clerk to the Bills in 1660, and Clerk of Supply to the Lords in Council in 1665. Both were lucrative positions, involving collection of fees, from Parliament {{in the first}} case, and from petitioners to the Court of Session in the latter. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Moray had {{established himself as a}} courtier and scientist at Whitehall, London, and employed Bruce as <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> messenger between Whitehall and the Duke of Lauderdale, Secretary for Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In April 1598, Sigismund {{resigned}} as Prince of Transylvania {{in favor of}} the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (who was also the King of Hungary); reversed his decision in October 1598; and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Báthory, his cousin. Báthory had strong ties to the Polish chancellor and hetman Jan Zamoyski and placed Transylvania {{under the influence of the}} King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa. He was also <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> ally of the new Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă, one of Michael's greatest enemies. Movilă had deposed Ştefan Rǎzvan with the help of Polish hetman Jan Zamoyski in August 1595.|$|E
5|$|John then {{travelled}} to France for diplomatic negotiations, {{before returning}} to England. Gaveston was exiled by the Ordainers but later made an irregular return. Gaveston was killed in June 1312 by Thomas of Lancaster and other nobles. It fell upon John, together with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, to reconcile the two parties after this event. In 1313 he followed Edward II on a state visit to France, and thereafter generally remained <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> subject. In 1318 he witnessed the Treaty of Leake, which restored Edward to full power.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{alternatives}} {{exist to}} standard retainage provisions {{that provide the}} same benefits and protections. For example, parties can agree to establish <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> account. <b>A</b> <b>trust</b> account provides the contractor with some control over its money, {{even if it is}} being held by the owner. In <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> account, retainage is withheld by the owner, placed in <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> account with <b>a</b> trustee that has a fiduciary relationship to the contractor. The trustee can invest the retainage at the contractor's direction, thereby allowing the contractor to [...] "use" [...] the retained funds that normally would sit idle in an escrow account.|$|R
5|$|Trust {{funds are}} {{earmarked}} for specific programs and purposes {{in accordance with}} a statute that designates the fund as <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> Its statutory designation distinguishes the fund as <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> rather than <b>a</b> special fund. The Highway <b>Trust</b> Fund is <b>an</b> example of <b>trust</b> funds.|$|R
50|$|All fifty U.S. states {{provide some}} {{protection}} for the assets of <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> against the creditors of the beneficiaries. Some states allow asset protection for <b>a</b> self-settled <b>trust</b> (<b>a</b> <b>trust</b> in which the settlor or creator of the trust is included as a potential discretionary beneficiary) and some states do not.|$|R
5|$|Lê Duẩn {{became a}} member of the Revolutionary Youth League in 1928. He cofounded the Indochina Communist Party in 1930. Lê Duẩn was imprisoned the next year. He was {{released}} six years later, in 1937. From 1937 to 1939 he advanced in the party hierarchy and at the 2nd National Congress, he joined its Central Committee. He was imprisoned again the following year for fomenting an uprising. After five years he was released, shortly after the 1945 August Revolution, in which the Indochinese Communist Party took power. Following his release, he became <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> associate of Hồ Chí Minh, the leading Vietnamese Communist.|$|E
5|$|The English court viewed John of Brittany as <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> diplomat. He was {{a skilled}} negotiator, and his French {{connections}} were a useful asset. By 1307 {{he was also}} one of the kingdom's oldest earls. As the relationship between Edward II and his nobility deteriorated, Richmond remained loyal to the king; in 1309 he went on an embassy to Pope Clement V on behalf of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston. John was allegedly Gaveston's close personal friend, and did not share the antagonistic attitudes held by certain other earls.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E

50|$|Some have {{suggested}} that this means <b>a</b> Quistclose <b>trust,</b> whilst it is indubitably <b>a</b> <b>trust,</b> {{it would not be}} <b>a</b> resulting <b>trust</b> as the beneficial interest never 'results back' to the lender; it was with him all the time. However, others point out that there are many resulting trusts where the beneficial interest never leaves the donor: the classic example of <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> failing for uncertain objects, for example.|$|R
5|$|The {{enterprise}} {{version of}} Windows 10 offers additional security features; administrators {{can set up}} policies for the automatic encryption of sensitive data, selectively block applications from accessing encrypted data, and enable Device Guarda system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.|$|E
5|$|William {{remained}} {{loyal to}} King Stephen during the 12th-century period of civil war. He became <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> royal servant during the subsequent reign of HenryII, accompanying the king on campaigns in France and Ireland. He served as sheriff of Herefordshire from 1173 until 1175. The family's power {{reached its peak}} under his son William during the reigns of King Richard I and King John.|$|E
5|$|William's father Robert, {{the first}} Ufford Earl of Suffolk, {{was a close}} {{associate}} of King Edward III and <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> military commander {{in the early stages}} of the Hundred Years' War. His military career included the Battle of Crécy, the Siege of Calais and the Battle of Poitiers, where he greatly distinguished himself. In 1324, Robert married Margaret, daughter of Walter Norwich, Treasurer of the Exchequer, expanding his already substantial territorial holdings in East Anglia.|$|E

5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden relied on <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti {{was close to}} bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|Deployed in India, Nolan was {{eventually}} made the regimental riding master and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials {{to evaluate the}} use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was made a Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. <b>A</b> <b>trusted</b> voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East {{in the early days of}} the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>trust</b> {{instrument}} (also {{sometimes called}} <b>a</b> deed of <b>trust,</b> where executed {{by way of}} deed) is an instrument in writing executed by a settlor used to constitute <b>a</b> <b>trust.</b> Trust instruments are generally only used in relation to an inter vivos trust; testamentary trusts are usually created under a will.|$|R
25|$|Trusts go by many {{different}} names, {{depending on the}} characteristics or {{the purpose of the}} trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, <b>a</b> single <b>trust</b> might accurately be described in several ways.
