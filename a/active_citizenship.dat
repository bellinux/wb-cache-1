It {{played a key role in}} establishing the Consultative Committee (later the Birmingham Council for Community Associations), to foster the development of local community associations and the building of community halls. Currently, it runs two programmes aimed at promoting <b>active</b> <b>citizenship</b> among young people, noting in particular the growing ethnic diversity of the population. The first rewards children who have contributed directly to the improvement of their own local environments. The second involves 1,000 children aged 11 to 14 projecting their lives forward by 20 years, and proposing plans for developments they consider most important for their lives and for those of their children.|$|E
500|$|Gender is an {{additional}} overarching theme within dictator novels. National portraits in Latin America often insist {{on the importance of}} women (and men) that are healthy, happy, productive, and patriotic, yet many national literary treasures often reflect government rhetoric in the way they code <b>active</b> <b>citizenship</b> as male. Masculinity is an enduring motif in the dictator novel. There is a connection between the pen and the penis in Latin American fiction, but this pattern cannot be explained by machismo aloneit is far more complex. According to Rebecca E. Biron, [...] "where we find violent, misogynistic fantasies of masculinity, we also [...] violent social relations between actual men and women." [...] Many Latin American works [...] "include characters who act out violent fictions of masculinity, and yet their narrative structure provides readers with alternative responses to misogynistic fantasies of masculine identity formation".|$|E

2500|$|Through an {{analysis}} of public responses to two separate but related events in contemporary Singapore — a church's claim that [...] "homosexuals can change" [...] and a former prime minister's published comments about openly gay civil servants in his administration — this article explores how a [...] "gay community" [...] has been imagined in Singapore, where homosexual acts remain illegal and where a [...] "conservative majority" [...] has been ideologically mobilised {{by the state and}} moral-religious entrepreneurs. A close reading of the debates within SiGNeL (the Singapore Gay News List) and the local mass media reveals ideological struggles — and, in particular, gay activists’ role in these struggles — surrounding a basic contradiction between Singapore's exclusionary laws and practices, and official state rhetoric about <b>active</b> <b>citizenship,</b> social diversity, and gradual liberalisation. This rhetoric is aimed primarily at attracting foreign talent and retaining mobile Singaporean talent in a globally integrated economy that is increasingly dependent upon creativity and innovation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Medina {{ran against}} token {{opposition}} {{for the position}} of international vice president on the SEIU executive board. He won, becoming first Mexican American elected to an international office at SEIU. Medina was an active vice president, overseeing many successful union organizing campaigns in the right-to-work Southwest and Deep South. He was a critical supporter of the <b>Active</b> <b>Citizenship</b> Campaign, an effort in the mid-1990s led by Miguel Contreras and others to boost Latino voting in Los Angeles County (and {{which led to the}} election of Antonio Villaraigosa as Mayor of Los Angeles in 2005). He {{played a critical role in}} SEIU's successful strike and organizing campaign at the University of Miami in 2001, engaging in a hunger strike in support of the janitors being organized there. In 2005, he brought the Latino voter project Mi Familia Vota to Arizona, where he and others led a successful effort to enact by referendum a rise in the state minimum wage. He led SEIU's successful campaign to convince the AFL-CIO to abandon its long-standing policy of opposition to illegal immigration and to support legalization of undocumented workers. Since the late 1990s, his views immigration have been largely been adopted by the American labor movement, and he was the Change to Win Federation's chief lobbyist on immigrant rights in 2006. Medina was the guiding force behind SEIU's Justice for Janitors in the 1990s and 2000s, and pushed the union to organize home healthcare workers by seeking legislative changes that would make the government the [...] "employer of record" [...] for these employees (allowing them to be easily organized by the tens of thousands). In 2000, he oversaw a Justice for Janitors organizing effort tied to collective bargaining negotiations that led to the largest wage increases in the history of the program, and in 2001 helped negotiate an employer neutrality and card check agreement between SEIU and the large Catholic Healthcare West hospital chain which led to thousands of new healthcare workers joining the union. As of 2006, he oversaw the activities of SEIU locals in 17 Southwestern and West Coast states. In 2010, he was unanimously elected international secretary-treasurer of the SEIU, completing the unfinished term of Anna Burger. In 2012, he was re-elected to the position.|$|E
6000|$|This I {{presume to}} be: that every citizen {{has a right}} to share in {{choosing}} those who make the laws; in order to prevent, as far as he can, laws being made which are unjust and injurious to him, to his family, or to his class; and that all are to be considered as 'active' citizens, save the criminal, the insane, or those unable to support themselves. The best rough test of a man's being able to support himself is, I doubt not, his being able to keep a house over his head, or, at least, a permanent lodging; and that, I presume, will be in a few years the one and universal test of <b>active</b> <b>citizenship,</b> unless we should meanwhile obtain the boon of a compulsory Government education, and an educational franchise founded thereon. But, it must be asked--and answered also--What is there in such a test, even as it stands now, only partially applied, which is not as fair for women as it is for men? 'Is it just that an educated man, who is able independently to earn his own livelihood, should have a vote: but that an equally educated woman, equally able independently to earn her own livelihood, should not? Is it just that a man owning a certain quantity of property should have a vote in respect of that property: but that a woman owning the same quantity of property, and perhaps a hundred or a thousand times more, should have no vote?' What difference, founded on Nature and Fact, exists between the two cases? ...|$|E

By choosing this case we aim to analyse the innovative and integrated use of the opportunities provided by the regional normative, which gave rise to a process of participation where the local community has been able to find shared answers to deal with some issues remained, for a long time, unresolved. The analysis shows how a conscious use of the possibilities provided by the institutional system may help to trigger collaborative and cooperative relationship among the different actors in the field (public institutions and private companies, third sector and citizens). However, during the analysis, the same institutional context (i. e. Tuscany Region) has taken shape as the main obstacle to the possibility that these paths may contribute to overcome the traditional approach to the health policy, which is sectorial and directive, in order to assign a leading role to the local community...|$|R
