40|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of IgG {{molecules}} bound to normal platelets have ranged from several hundred to several tens of thousands. The lower estimates were generated from direct binding assays and stoichiometric assumptions. The higher values derive from competitive binding assays. in which platelet-associated lgG (PAIgG) is calculated from a standard curve using soluble lgG standards. Using a kinetic-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>assay.</b> we measured normal platelet lgG to be 21, 200 ± 9, 400 molecules per platelet when a competitive assay and E STIMATES OF NORMAL LEVELS of platelet-asso-ciated IgG (PAIgG) have generally ranged from 1 to 10 fg per platelet. ” 2 This corresponds to 4, 000 to 40, 000 molecules of IgG per platelet, or I 02 to 103 -fold greater than estimates for normal red cell-associated IgG. 3 Two report...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} the mechanism whereby thalassemia in its milder forms may protect against malaria, we have examined the expression of neoantigen at the surface of Plasmodium fakiparum-parasitized thalassemic red cells. Neoantigen expression was estimated by measurement of antibody bound after incubation in serum from adults living in a malaria-endemic area, using a quantitative radiometric <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>assay.</b> We found that P. falciparum-parasitized ct- and (3 -thalassemic red cells bind greater levels of antibody from endemic serum than controls: mean binding ratios (± SE), respectively, for ct- and a-thalassemia compared with controls were 1. 69 ± 0. 12 and 1. 23 ± 0. 06 on a cell for cell basis, and 1. 97 ± 0. 11 and 1. 47 ± 0. 08 after a correction for surface area differences. Binding of antibody increased exponentially during parasite maturation. In addition, we found a small but significant degree of binding of naturally occurring antibody to parasitized red cells, the extent of which was also greater in thalassemia. The apparent protective effect of thalassemia against malaria {{may be related to}} enhanced immune recognition and hence clearance of parasitized erythrocytes. Epidemiological studies suggest that the major inherited red cell disorders have attained high frequencies in malariou...|$|E
40|$|Immunofluorescent {{studies of}} {{intestinal}} tissues from young preruminant calves demonstrate {{the presence of}} two main populations of immunocytes synthesizing IgA and IgM. These cells had infiltrated the lamina propria of the intestine as early as 4 days of age. There was little evidence of any significant involvement of IgG 1 in intestinal immune synthesis of calves at this age although activity was demonstrable in the ileum and colon of one calf. In general there were more IgG 2 -synthesizing cells than IgG 1, but these were few compared with the main populations of IgA and IgM cells. Local antigenic stimulus to the intestinal mucosa of young fistulated calves using extracts of heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria produced antibody in the secretions {{over a period of}} approximately 3 weeks. A second administration of a similar antigenic dose produced a similar response indicating the requirement for continuous stimuli to maintain a measurable level of antibody secretion. Gel filtration and <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>assays</b> indicated that the antibacterial activity was predominantly associated with IgA and that IgM also played a significant role. Oral administration of bacterial antigens to colostrum-fed calves from 5 to 8 days of age produced a faecal antibody response, indicating that intestinal secretion could be successfully interrelated with the declining passive antibody to maintain an almost continuous level of intestinal antibody in early life...|$|R
40|$|A {{microplate}} immune-enzymatic {{method was}} developed for detecting serum antiplatelet antibodies. The method {{involves the use of}} antigen-coated platelets and alkaline phosphatase-labeled antihuman immunoglobulin. Linear correlation was obtained between the titer of platelet antibodies and substrate conversion. Twenty-four patients with immune thrombocytopenia and 40 normal controls were studied. Eighteen patients and one control were positive. Therefore, sensitivity and specificity were 75 % and 97 % respectively. ELISA also was found to be more sensitive than the indirect <b>antiglobulin</b> consumption <b>assay</b> (ACA) and appears to be a practical and easy method for routine evaluation of antiplatelet antibodies...|$|R

The test is easy to carry out on a large scale, and there is a positive correlation between the results and dye test and haemagglutination test titres...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that antibody may affect tumour growth directly, or indirectly by modulating {{the activities of}} T-cells, K-cells and macrophages. Therefore, these studies were designed to gain some insight into whether the pleomorphism exhibited by immunoglobulin classes and sub-classes might account for the numerous roles that have been postulated for antibody in tumour immunity. The model chosen was the inhibition of syngeneic tumour growth (s. e.) by an infection of C. parvrart (i. p.) in CBA mice, and three serological parameters were measured after administration of C. parvum, tumour or both. These were 1) immunoglobulin binding to tumour target cells in vitro (aom. times designated "anti-tumour antibody", in an operational sense); 2) total immunoglobulln class and sub-class levels; 3) snti-C. parvum antibody titres. WLth the aid of serum from appropriately immunised mice, an isotonic <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>assay</b> was developed to detect immunoglobulin binding to target cells in vitro. It soon became apparent that C. parvum (CN 613 U) administration (i. p.) to normal mice resulted {{in the production of}} immunoglobulin binding to tumour cells in vitro, accompanied by elevated levels of certain serum immunoglobulins (most markedly and consistently IgG^) and high anti-C. parvum antibody titres. These serological changes were dose and route dependent, although not dependent on an intact thymus, and they occurred with other adjuvants. The immunoglobulin binding to tumour cells in vitro was IgM, and exhibited no specificity for tumour cells. C. parvum (CM 613 U) administration (i. p.) to tumour bearing mice also elicited immunoglobulin capable of binding to tumour cells in vitro, accompanied by elevated levels of most immunoglobulin classes and sub-classes and high aati-C. parvum antibody titres. Again the changes were route dependent and could he diminished (or, in the case of immunoglobulin binding to tumour cells in vitro, abolished) by the administration of gold salts. They were also apparent in thymectomised mice and in mice treated with other adjuvants. The immmoglobulin binding to tumour cells in vitro occurred in all classes and sub-classes except IgA, and the 7 S immunoglobulin exhibited a degree of specificity for homologous tumour ce 2 fe, although the 19 S did not. Preliminary experiments were also undertaken to see if; 1) the antibody detected by the <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>assay</b> was due to genuine antigenantibody reaction; 2) immunoglobulin binding to tumour cells in vitro could be elicited without the intervention of adjuvant; 3) the serological changes could influence tumour growth; U) tumours of lymphoid origin could affect the immune response to defined antigens. The results are related to findings from other laboratories, and discussed from the standpoint of possible mechinisms of adjuvant action. Suggestions are made for improvement of techniques used and for further work in this area...|$|E
40|$|We have {{attempted}} to determine the cellular mechanism by which alpha-thalassaemia may protect against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Invasion and development of P. falciparum in the microcytic red cells of two-gene deletion forms of alpha-thalassaemia when measured morphologically or by [3 H]hypoxanthine incorporation were normal compared to controls. Normal invasion rates were also observed following schizogony in thalassaemic red cells. Neither {{the addition of the}} oxidant menadione, 30 % oxygen, nor modified medium, produced differential damage to parasites within thalassaemic cells. Furthermore, {{there were no significant differences}} in the binding of P. falciparum-parasitized alpha-thalassaemic and normal cells to C 32 melanoma cells in vitro. However, when neoantigen expression on the surface of infected thalassaemic cells was estimated using a quantitative radiometric <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>assay,</b> clear differences were observed. It was found that alpha-thalassaemic cells bound higher levels of antibody from serum obtained from individuals living in a malaria endemic area than control normal red cells. The binding ratio for thalassaemic compared with controls was 1. 69 on a cell-for-cell basis, and 1. 97 when related to surface area. The binding of antibody from immune serum increased exponentially during parasite maturation. We also found increased binding of naturally occurring antibody present in non-immune serum to parasitized thalassaemic red cells which also increased during parasite maturation. We conclude that the protection afforded by thalassaemia against malaria may not reside in the ability of parasites to enter, grow or cytoadhere to endothelium in such cells, but may be related to immune recognition and subsequent clearance of parasitized red cells...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies to {{influenza}} virus and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} are detectable in B cells {{during the early stages}} of the immune response, prior to their occurrence in plasma. To investigate similar phenomena in a model of immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, medical students in Ghana were screened for HBV markers, HBV surface (HBs) antigen (HBsAg), and HBV core antibodies (anti-HBc). Consenting volunteers, 24 of whom were seronegative (susceptible) and 2 of whom were positive for anti-HBc (prior infection), were vaccinated on day 0, day 40, and 6 months. Two sets of 10 blood samples, sequentially collected at intervals of 2 days following each immunization on days 0 and 40, were processed into B-cell lysates and plasma. Solid-phase HBsAg coated on microtiter plates for enzyme immunoassay or nitrocellulose membranes for dot blot assay was used to detect anti-HBs activity by an indirect <b>antiglobulin</b> <b>assay.</b> A commercially procured sandwich immunoassay was used, along with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a dot blot assay, for the detection of anti-HBs in B-cell lysates and plasma. Following the first injection of vaccine, a single sample of B-cell lysate collected between 5 and 21 days revealed anti-HBs in 18 / 21 subjects with no plasma antibodies detectable by sandwich immunoassay. After the booster dose was injected on day 40, a single sample of B-cell lysate collected between 44 and 49 days showed anti-HBs in 16 / 19 subjects, and this was accompanied by plasma antibodies in 8 subjects. In contrast, between 8 and 13 days, both subjects with prior HBV infection showed anti-HBs in B-cell lysates and plasma. Thus, primary immunization with the HBV vaccine appears to transiently elicit low-affinity anti-HBs in B-cell lysates into plasma...|$|E
40|$|Polyanion—immunoglobulin complexes, {{considered}} {{important factors}} in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis common in systemic lupus erythematosus, were found and isolated from sera of NZB mice by selectively binding them to an anion-exchange cellulose (DE 52). Accurate quantification of such complexes was possible, in terms of immunoglobulin content, {{by means of an}} <b>antiglobulin</b> complement-fixation <b>assay.</b> In sera of NZB mice the concentration of immune complexes increased up to about 11 months of age and then it declined, whereas in the sera of the C 57 B 1 and HaICR strains of mice, which do not develop spontaneous glomerulonephritis, the concentration was lower initially but increased steadily with increasing age and reached an equivalent level at about 27 months. The complexes were composed primarily of immunoglobulins of the IgG class bound to native DNA. The finding of significant levels of circulating immune complexes in mouse strains without renal disease suggests that such complexes, although necessary, might not be sufficient and solely responsible for overt glomerulonephritis...|$|R
40|$|Three techniques, {{based on}} the antiglobulin principle, used for the {{detection}} of autoantibodies against platelets, were compared; the <b>antiglobulin</b> consumption <b>assay</b> (QACA), the platelet radioactive antiglobulin test (PRAT) and the platelet suspension immunofluorescence test (PSIFT). Upon incubation of normal donor platelets with purified IgG, in concentrations higher than that in serum, an increased amount of platelet-associated IgG was demonstrated only in the QACA. Upon incubation with aggregated IgG, all three tests became positive, but the PSIFT only with high concentrations of aggregates. Binding of soluble C 1 q-binding immune complexes (IC), which consisted of tetanus toxoid and IgG antitetanus antibodies (TaT) to normal donor platelets, was only detectable in the QACA. However, a positive result was obtained in all three tests with platelets incubated with soluble DNA-IgG-antiDNA antibodies (DaD) IC. Fixation of the platelets with paraformaldehyde prevented the binding and the detection of the DaD-IC, but not of IgG, aggregated IgG or TaT-IC. Eluates from platelets incubated with aggregated IgG, TaT- or DaD-IC did not react with normal donor platelets in the three techniques, in contrast to eluates from platelets sensitized with platelet antibodie...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of these studies}} {{was to assess the}} relative role of humoral or cellular immune mechanisms in the neutropenia of Feltry's syndrome. The amounts of neutrophil-bound IgG were measured by a sensitive <b>antiglobulin</b> inhibition <b>assay.</b> These values were increased in eight out of seventeen patients with Felty's syndrome over the highest values seen with seventeen patients with rheumatoid arthritis without leukopenia or twenty-six normal individuals. The levels of serum IgG neutrophil-binding activity from thirteen out of twenty-one patients with Felty's syndrome were greater than the highest values seen with normal sera compared to six out of thirty sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis alone. A strong correlation was observed between the levels of direct neutrophil-bound IgG and the serum IgG neutrophil-binding activity for the seventeen patients with Felty's syndrome. Inhibition of normal marrow granulocyte colony growth greater than 40 % was seen with the peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes from five out of eleven patients with Feltry's syndrome. All five patients had normal levels of neutrophil bound IgG and normal to moderately increased levels of serum IgG neutrophil binding activity. In contrast, of the six patients whose mononuclear leucocytes did not inhibit granulocyte colony growth, three had markedly elevated levels of neutrophil-bound IgG and four had elevated levels of serum IgG neutrophil binding activity. These results suggest that humoral and cellular immune mechanisms of neutropenia may be present in different subsets of patients with Felty's syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Five rubella antigens were {{evaluated}} in an <b>antiglobulin</b> enzyme-linked immunosorbent <b>assay</b> for rubella-specific IgG subclass antibody. One monoclonal anti-human IgG subclass antibody {{was used for}} each of IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgG 4, but two were compared for IgG 3. A total of 101 sera were tested from cases of rubella {{in the distant past}} and from cases of primary rubella, reinfection and following immunization. Only one serum gave a discrepant result for specific IgG 1, being positive with only one rubella antigen, a commercially prepared antigen coated on to microtitre wells (Enzygnost; Behringwerke). No sera contained detectable specific IgG 2. Only four sera contained specific IgG 4, and this was detectable only with Enzygnost antigen. For specific IgG 3 little difference was observed between the two monoclonal anti-human IgG 3 subclass antibodies; only two very weakly positive sera gave discrepant results. However, varying results were obtained for specific IgG 3 with the different antigens. Enzygnost gave more positive results for specific IgG 3 with most categories of sera. It is concluded that the differences between various reports of the rubella-specific IgG subclass profile cannot be explained entirely by the use of different rubella antigens...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of these studies}} were to quantify the amounts of immunoglobulin (Ig) G bound to peripheral blood neutrophils from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to determine the contributions of soluble immune complexes or anticell antibodies to the levels of IgG neutrophil-binding activity in SLE sera. Neutrophil-bound IgG, determined by a sensitive <b>antiglobulin</b> inhibition <b>assay,</b> was elevated in 7 out of 14 SLE patients compared with values obtained in 23 normal controls. The levels of IgG neutrophil-binding activity in sera were elevated in 22 of 38 patients with SLE over the values seen with 36 normal sera. No correlation {{was found between the}} peripheral blood neutrophil counts in the SLE patients and the values for IgG adherent to the cells or serum cell-binding activity. The sera from 18 patients with SLE were fractionated by gel filtration. Elevated levels of IgG neutrophil-binding activity were found in 11 of the 18 G- 200 excluded pools and in 13 of the G- 200 IgG pools. In nine sera elevated levels were observed in both pools. F(ab') 2 fragments of IgG from SLE sera bound to normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in greater amounts than F(ab') 2 fragments of IgG from normal sera. A significant correlation existed between the values of IgG neutrophil-binding activity found in SLE sera and those obtained with both the G- 200 excluded and IgG pools. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of four sera from SLE patients confirmed the presence of both large (greater than 19 S) and intermediate-sized (7 S- 19 S) cell-binding immune complexes as well as of monomeric IgG antibodies to neutrophils. The levels of IgG neutrophil-binding activity in the SLE sera correlated well with the results obtained with the Raji cell assay for immune complexes {{as well as with the}} titer of antibodies to nuclear antigens. These data indicate that circulating neutrophils from patients with SLE commonly have increased amounts of cell-bound IGG. The elevated levels of IgG neutrophil-binding activity in the sera of these patients are caused by both soluble immune complexes and antibodies reactive with neutrophils...|$|R
40|$|An <b>antiglobulin</b> {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent <b>assay</b> for rubella-specific IgG 1 and IgG 3 {{was adapted}} to measure antibody avidity by incorporating a mild protein denaturant, diethylamine (DEA), into the serum diluent. Sera were tested at varying dilutions, both {{with and without}} DEA, if they contained sufficient specific IgG 1 or IgG 3. The optical density (OD) was measured and curves were plotted. The highest OD (V) was noted and halved (V/ 2). The distance between the OD curves at V/ 2 was measured as the DEA shift value. Sera were examined from people whose sera contained rubella-specific antibodies {{as a consequence of}} infection or vaccination in the distant past (24 sera), recent primary rubella (66 sera), symptomatic reinfection (11 sera) or asymptomatic reinfection (64 sera). For specific IgG 1 the DEA shift value was less than 0. 6 for cases of rubella in the distant past, compared with greater than 0. 8 for the first month after primary infection. The maximum DEA shift value for the sera from cases of reinfection was 0. 65. No serum from cases of rubella in the distant past contained sufficient specific IgG 3 to estimate avidity. The sera collected within 1 month of onset of primary rubella gave DEA shift values greater than 0. 7 compared with sera from reinfections, which gave DEA shift values less than 0. 6, except for two sera from a case of symptomatic reinfection. Thus the assessment of specific IgG subclass avidity is of value in differentiating serologically primary rubella from reinfection...|$|R
