5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> shoot between them.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battle arena, with {{characters}} and enemies moving according to their position on the grid. Four commands are available to the party: Attack (fight enemies), Contact (talk with <b>an</b> <b>enemy),</b> Analyze (check <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> for its strength and weaknesses), and Form (rearrange the party on the grid). The character's main means of attack is their Persona, beings summoned into battle to cast a spell that can heal the party, and inflict physical or elemental damage on <b>an</b> <b>enemy.</b> Each Persona has access to up to eight skills, and each character can change their Persona during their turn. Personas earn experience points independent of the characters they are assigned to, and gain new abilities through extended use. Experience is awarded based on how often the player uses certain characters or Personas. Alongside their Personas, each character is able to attack with an equipped melee weapon or firearm, use an item, or attempt {{to talk with the}} demons that act as the game's standard enemies.|$|E
5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E

5|$|Pawns are {{the only}} pieces that capture {{differently}} from how they move. A pawn can capture <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> piece on {{either of the two}} squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} for enpassant was {{to prevent the}} newly added two-square first move for pawns from allowing a pawn to evade capture by <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> pawn. Asian chess variants, because of their separation from European chess prior to that period, do not feature any of these moves.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across <b>an</b> <b>enemy,</b> tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must recharge for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E
5|$|The velites {{were placed}} {{at the front of}} the maniples, so that the velites had the chance to prove {{themselves}} and win glory by seeking out single combat with <b>an</b> <b>enemy.</b> This is also why they wore highly identifiable wolfskin headdresses.|$|E
5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption—shortened to Redemption—is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) presented {{primarily from}} the third-person perspective; the playable character is shown on the screen while an optional first-person mode used to view the character's immediate environment is available. The camera can be freely rotated around the character and positioned above it to give a greater overview of the immediate area. The game follows a linear, mission-based structure. Interaction is achieved by using a mouse to click on <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> or environmental object to attack it or to activate it. Interaction is context based; clicking on <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> initiates combat, while clicking on a door causes it to open or close.|$|E

50|$|Whenever a player's fighter destroys <b>a</b> large <b>enemy,</b> <b>a</b> score {{multiplier}} is set. The multiplier doubles {{every time}} <b>a</b> large <b>enemy</b> is destroyed before timer reaches 0, {{for up to}} 64. The multiplier timer increases whenever <b>a</b> large <b>enemy</b> is destroyed. When multiplier is in effect and the player's medal level is already at 10000 points, revealing medal causes 100000-point medal to appear instead. When multiplier timer reaches 0, the score multiplier effect simply disappears.|$|R

5|$|A bone of contention, however, arose {{over the}} Queen's {{inheritance}} and dowry. Duke Rinaldo refused {{to release the}} former, and left the latter £15,000 in arrears. In 1700, five years later, the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry; her inheritance, however, remained sequestered, and relations with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. Leopold was <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> of Louis XIV, James and Mary's patron.|$|E
5|$|Ace (stylized as ACE as {{acronym for}} Air Combat Emulator) is a flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Cascade Games for various home computers released in 1985. The player takes {{the role of}} a fighter jet pilot defending an English coastland against <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> invasion, having to fight off aerial, ground and naval forces while Allied bases evacuate. The display shows the plane's instrumentation and cockpit view.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Hungary {{at the beginning}} of 1290. On this occasion, Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom, also urged him to come, since the archbishop wanted to dethrone the excommunicated LadislausIV with the assistance of Ivan Kőszegi. Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hahót, <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> of the Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him. Hahót sent Andrew to Vienna, where Albert I, Duke of Austria, held him in captivity.|$|E

He was a {{contemporary}} with the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony, as Artavasdes I was mentioned in their diplomatic affairs.|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory is {{achieved}} when <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> base is captured or all enemies are defeated. Each character holds four weapons and four items, and each has an assigned character class, which affects their movement range, damage and what weapons can be used. Mounted units also {{have the option to}} dismount, which changes their abilities and stats while reducing movement range.|$|E
