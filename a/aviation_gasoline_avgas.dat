40|$|Flying {{in a small}} piston-engine plane bears little {{resemblance}} to flying in a commercial jet. There are no lines at the airport, no baggage checks, and often less legroom once you duck inside the cabin. You can feel every bump in the tarmac as the plane heads down the runway, every rumble of the engine. Once you are aloft there’s no denying the improbability of flight; the low cruising altitude offers detailed views of the land passing below. The experience is more like traveling in an airborne car than in the insulated cocoon of an airliner. For passengers like this writer, it’s also much more fun. There’s another less obvious difference. Unlike commercial jets, which use kerosene-based jet fuel, piston-engine aircraft still mostly run on leaded <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline,</b> or <b>avgas.</b> In fact, avgas {{is one of the}} few fuels in the United States that still contain lead, 1 leaving it the single largest source of lead emissions in the country, according to the U.

40|$|Lead {{scavengers}} {{have been}} used in leaded gasoline since the 1920 s. • EDB was used as an agricultural pesticide from 1948 until 1993. • Although leaded gasoline has been banned in on-road vehicles since 1996, it is still used in certain off-road applications such as <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> (<b>Avgas)</b> and automobile racing fuel and both of these fuels also contain lead scavengers. Lead scavengers are compounds added to leaded gasoline to prevent buildup of lead deposits that foul internal combustion engines. In this capacity, EDB and EDC are referred to as “lead scavengers”. Even though leaded gasoline has not been used for on-road automobiles for more than a decade, lead compounds (and, therefore, lead scavengers) are still in use in <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> (<b>Avgas)</b> and in some off-road applications such as racing fuel. In addition, EDB was used as a pesticide and fumigant. EDC was used as a fumigant, in varnish and finish removers, in soaps and scouring compounds, in organic synthesis for extraction and cleaning purposes, in metal degreasers, in ore floatation, and in paints, coatings and adhesives. EDB is also used as a chemical intermediate in synthesis and as a nonflammable solvent for resins, gums, and waxes. EDC is now primarily used to manufacture vinyl chloride.

DEF(AUST) 5706 is an Australian Defence standard mandatory {{for use by the}} Australian Navy, Army and Air Force. The test protocol required the measurement of the 3 / 4 control, extinguishment and 1 / 3 burnback times for a circular pan of <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> (<b>AVGAS</b> 100 / 130), 0. 28 m 2 in surface area. The test program involved compressed-air foams (CAF) and aspirated foams of two expansion ratios, and employed two AFFF formulations: a 6 % telomer concentrate and, to obtain base-line measurements, 3 % PFOS FC- 600 concentrate which was manufactured by the 3 M company prior to the PFOS phase out. At lower expansion (7 : 1), the aspirated and compressed-air foams demonstrated similar fire control performance, whilst more expanded (9 : 1) CAF was generally more efficient at extinguishing, but less efficient in controlling the fire. CAF formed a better seal over the fuel surface and at the hot pan walls, and these foams performed noticeably better than aspirated foam against fuel re-ignition. The paper links these observations with the underlying distributions of bubble sizes, which were measured and fitted to modified Rosin/Rammler cumulative volume distribution functions. We propose that a modified version of DEF(AUST) 5706 be adopted as a universal small-scale test protocol...|$|E
40|$|The first {{jet fuels}} were <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> (<b>avgas),</b> and the {{characteristics}} of subsequent jet fuels have evolved from this original choice, the available supply infrastructure, and the refiners' capabilities. Earlier on, {{it was evident that}} avgas would have to be altered to operate satisfactorily in jet powered aircraft. The present contribution outlines the various requirements that led to development of various operational jet fuels, including United States Jet A (European Jet A- 1), JP- 4 (NATO code, F- 40), JP- 5 (NATO code, F- 44), JP- 7 (US only), JP- 8 (F- 34), JP-TS (US only), and JP- 8 + 100. To reduce this fuel logistic burden, the NATO Armed Forces are advancing the use of a single fuel for both aircraft and ground equipment. To this end, F- 34 is replacing distillate Diesel fuel in many applications. In order to make this type of fuel compatible with direct injection compression engines, the Fuels and Lubricants Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens, used a stationary Diesel engine fueled with fuel blends containing two different types of biodiesel, at proportions up to 50 %. In this paper, fuel consumption and exhaust emission measurements from a single cylinder, stationary, Diesel engine are described. The two types of biodiesel appeared to have equal performance, and irrespective of the raw material used for their production, their addition to the JP- 8 aviation fuel improved the particulate matter emissions.

40|$|A Professional Project Report Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Water Resources Policy/Management Concentration, Water Resources Program, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico,December 2004 Approximately 9, 600 to 10, 600 {{gallons of}} <b>aviation</b> <b>gasoline</b> (<b>avgas)</b> were {{released}} into a shallow aquifer from a leaking underground storage tank located at a municipal airport in Central Wisconsin. A municipal wellfield that serves three neighboring communities is located approximately 3, 500 to 4, 000 feet downgradient {{of the release}} site. Emergency response remedial actions included the removal of contaminated soil from the source area. A sump was installed within the excavation backfill to recover free product and contaminated groundwater. Interim remediation efforts included equipping the sump with a pump and a vacuum well point system was installed. A site investigation was conducted by Earth Tech, Inc. (Earth Tech) to determine the degree, nature, and extent of the avgas release at the municipal airport. The investigation was conducted between November 10, 2003, and August 13, 2004, and included advancing soil borings, installing monitoring wells and piezometers, collecting and laboratory analyzing soil and groundwater samples, and conducting a geophysical survey. An exposure assessment was also completed prior to the preparation of a remedial action plan to evaluate the potential human health risks the avgas release imposes on the municipal wellfield. The following findings were generated {{as a result of}} these efforts. • Residual avgas contamination detected in soil exceeding Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 720 Residual Contaminant Levels (RCL) is limited to the immediate vicinity of the avgas releases and just side or downgradient of the releases. • Groundwater beneath the site has been impacted by the avgas releases at levels exceeding Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 140 Enforcement Standards (ESs). The downgradient extent of the impacted groundwater plume is estimated at approximately 300 feet southeast of the release locations. • An undissolved contaminant plume, containing toluene, benzene, lead, and other toxic products that are known carcinogens, has been encountered in 10 wells at the site. • The geophysical survey indicated a bedrock ridge separates two shallow basin structures in the investigation area. The ridge causes the southeasterly movement of groundwater and the plume to divide into southerly and easterly flow components that flow toward the shallow basins. In the southeastern portion of the site, the water table descends into less permeable seams, and the rising bedrock surface causes a thinning of the saturated zone. These natural conditions have helped to minimize the downgradient migration of the contaminant plume. The final remedial action plan needs to address the following relevant transport mechanisms, exposure pathways, and potential receptors affected by the avgas releases: • Leaching and groundwater transport are considered relevant transport mechanisms that final remedial actions will need to address. • Mobile free-liquid migration is considered a relevant transport mechanism at the site; yet, it is not considered a transpOlt mechanism that will continue to release substantial quantities of contaminant mass into the environment. • Inhalation of contaminant vapors in a below grade confined space is considered a relevant exposure pathway at the site. Exposure prevention measures will be required if utility or construction work is required within the impacted area. • Ingestion of contaminated media in a below grade confined space is considered a relevant exposure pathway at the site. Exposure prevention measures will be required if utility or construction work is required within the impacted area. • Construction/utility workers working in below grade conditions within the impacted area at the site would be considered relevant receptors to direct contact with contaminated soil or groundwater or inhalation of contaminant vapors. • The municipal wellfield is considered a relevant receptor at the site; but it is not considered to be a threatened receptor under current site conditions...|$|E
