5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark was sent from Virginia to enforce its claim to much of the land in the Great Lakes region.

The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because Clark carried letters from the French ambassador stating that France supported the Americans. These letters made most of the French <b>and</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> inhabitants of the area unwilling to support the British.|$|E

Many historical sites <b>and</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E
