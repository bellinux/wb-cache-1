5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari had {{suggested}} to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be the}} Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali {{was the same as}} Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal <b>and</b> <b>wine,</b> and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E

40|$|The total {{phenolics}} {{and individual}} phenolics of the groups; hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols, flavonol algycones, flavan- 3 -ols, stilbenes and anthocyanins were analysed from healthy and powdery mildew infected grape leaves, berries <b>and</b> <b>wines.</b> The wine varieties viz., Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc reported higher leaf phenolic content {{as compared to}} a table grape variety- Thompson Seedless. Significant increase in total phenolic content of leaves was registered with increase in foliar disease severity. Berries <b>and</b> <b>wines</b> of Cabernet Sauvignon exhibited polynomial pattern of total phenolic content with increase at lower levels of infection followed by decreasing trend. However, Sauvignon blanc wines reported linear negative relationship with powdery mildew infection levels. Phenolic profile of the leaves, berries <b>and</b> <b>wines</b> was significantly altered by the disease. The foliar infection in general resulted into accumulation of phenolic compounds in leaves and reduction in berries <b>and</b> <b>wines</b> due to cluster disease infection. Multifold accumulation of resveratrol was recorded in infected berries <b>and</b> its <b>wines</b> while anthocyanins were reduced significantly due to infections...|$|R

5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond.

5|$|In 1877, Skopje {{was chosen}} as the capital city of the new Kosovo Vilayet, which {{encompassed}} present-day Kosovo, northwestern Macedonia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

Of the Skopje Muslim population of the late Ottoman period German linguist Gustav Weigand noted that though most were Albanians regarded as Turks or Ottomans (Osmanli), they spoke Turkish in public and Albanian at home.
