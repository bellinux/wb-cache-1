5|$|Despite tensions, {{the march}} was a resounding success. More {{than a quarter}} of a million people of diverse ethnicities {{attended}} the event, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E
5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E

5|$|After {{rest and}} recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles sector of the front in mid-October. Here Kippenberger volunteered for sniper duty despite not being known for his accuracy as a marksman. He served in this capacity until he was badly wounded in the arm by shrapnel on 10 November 1916.

The Temple Theater houses a 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater Organs still in their original installations in the state. With seating for 1800 persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the largest}} stages in the United States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City.

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{known that}} the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.

The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not known}} which {{submarine}} had sunk Irish Oak. The survivors knew {{only that it}} was not U-650.

About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured. As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.|$|E
