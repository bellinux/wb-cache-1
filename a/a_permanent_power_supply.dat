40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{analysis}} of energy consumption in cellular networks. We focus {{on the distribution of}} energy consumed by a base station for one isolated cell. We first define the energy consumption model in which the consumed energy is divided into two parts: The additive part and the broadcast part. The broadcast part is the part of energy which is oblivious of the number of mobile stations but depends on the farthest terminal, for instance, the energy effort necessary to maintain the beacon signal. The additive part is due to the communication power which depends on both the positions, mobility and activity of all the users. We evaluate by closed form expressions the mean and variance of the consumed energy. Our analytic evaluation is based on the hypothesis that mobiles are distributed according to a Poisson point process. We show that the two parts of energy are of the same order of magnitude and that substantial gain can be obtained by power control. We then consider the impact of mobility on the energy consumption. We apply our model to two case studies: The first one is to optimize the cell radius from the energetic point of view, the second one is to dimension the battery of a base station in sites that {{do not have access to}} <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

Introduction: In determing the {{feasibility}} of utilizing Water-power to operate electrically the industries of any city, many things must necessarly be taken in to careful consideration. Among which are; the amount of water-power available. Cost of developing this power. The interest on this amount. Demands for power. Comparsion of water power with that of steam with respect to cost. All of these and many others seemingly non-important items must be taken in to consideration in order that the financial out-come of such an investment as a water power plant may be determined. Charles. T. Main makes the following statement as {{to the value of}} Water-power. " The value of an undeveloped variable power is usually nothing if the varation is great, unless it is to be supplemented by a steam-plant. It is of value then only when the cost per horse power for the double plant, is less than the cost for steam- power under the same conditions as mentioned for <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>power.</b> And its value can be represented in the same manner, as the value of <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> has been represented. The value of a developed power, is as follows:- If the power can be run cheaper than steam, the value is that of the power plus the cost of the plant less depreciation, if it can not be run as cheaply as steam considering its cost,etc, the value of the power is nothing, but the value of the plant is such as could be paid for if new, which would bring the total cost of runing down to the cost of steam power, less depreciation. ” Mr. Main's comparison has been criticised by a great many because it is in favor of a steam plant, which in reality...|$|R
40|$|Rapid trends show {{a steady}} {{decrease}} in electronic device form factors, which are miniaturizing and flattening, while demonstrating {{an increase in}} device functionality, requiring complex and exacting power needs. This movement has motivated a shift in energy storage design and manufacture to accommodate novel and unconventional materials, new device geometries, and non-traditional fabrication methods. A combination of these strategies {{will lead to a}} revolution in the way energy storage components are designed, integrated, and utilized in electronic devices. In this work, we present one possible strategy combining a materials innovation with simple engineering methods to fabricate and integrate batteries directly onto a device. A novel ionic liquid gel electrolyte compatible with zinc-metal oxide battery systems was synthesized. This gel electrolyte properties and its compatibility with the electrodes, current collector materials, packaging, and substrates were investigated. A simple, low-cost, solution-based printing method for integrating energy storage components directly onto a device is demonstrated with a direct write dispenser printing system. The dispenser printer is able to pattern "inks" into multilayer devices with custom dimensions. Printed 1 cm 2 zinc-metal oxide microbatteries utilizing the ionic liquid gel electrolyte were fabricated and then various device quantities such as its storage capacity, power performance, self-discharge, and other properties were characterized. Prospective applications of this printable battery include flexible electronics and applications that need highly customized integrated or miniature energy storage such as printed circuit boards, <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> for autonomous wireless sensors, and active RFID tags...|$|R

We propose two alternatives using EDT working in the generator regime: 1) a bare self-balanced electrodynamic tether placed in an equilibrium position in the synodic frame Jupiter-Io, and 2) a rotating EDT orbiting around Io to generate <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> and to provide propellantless orbital maneuvering capability. In the first alternative we review several tether designs addressing the benefits which {{can be obtained from}} them. In the second one, two mission scenarios are investigated; both involve a 25 -km-long 5 -cm-wide tape tether placed on a stable retrograde equatorial orbit around Io capable to provide kW-level useful power extracted from the fast rotating Jupiter plasmasphere. In the first scenario the tether current is controlled to provide maximum power generation. The amount of power produced and the impact on the orbit stability is investigated numerically. In the second scenario the current is controlled in order to reduce or increase the orbital energy of the system with the possibility of reaching escape velocity. Results show that EDT can be used as <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> production system in exploration missions to Io without compromising the orbital stability...|$|R

40|$|MIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{majority}} of energy conservation measures (ECM) implemented by South African Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), are {{funded by the}} Eskom Demand Side Management (DSM) initiative. In 2013 Eskom reported a total DSM savings of 595 MW. To measure this effect power usage data needs to be recorded. A slight variance with the accuracy of measurement will however {{have a significant impact}} on the reported savings. It is therefore of critical importance to ensure consistent energy measurements throughout the life cycle of the ECM. A literature study was conducted in order to investigate the individual effects each step of the measurement process contributes toward the overall accuracy. Components investigated include instrumentation transformers, the ADC process and the different signal processing techniques available. The study also investigated different power loggers and their impact on the overall accuracy. The study found that each component has the potential to affect the accuracy of the measurement. However, the most significant risk to accuracy was not any specific component, but rather the process of installation and setup of the equipment. This prompted the development of a new procedure to address the verification of measurements. The verification procedure consists of three main parts namely, Verify measurements of temporary power logger (1), Evaluation of data recorded (2) and Verification of <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> logger (3). The first part verifies the accuracy of the temporary power logger and assists with initial installation on site. Part two focuses on verifying the measurements of the temporary power logger with independent data. It then uses the temporary power logger to verify the measurements of the newly installed <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> logger. The third part verifies the measurements of <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>power</b> logger post-implementation of the energy conservation measure. The new verification procedure was tested on several industrial projects. The procedure identified an omitted load of 1 MW with a potential annual cost impact of R 4. 8 million. The procedure also identified several examples of incorrect CT ratios amounting to a combined daily error of 3. 4 MW were also identified. This relates to a direct impact of R 16. 3 million for the project stakeholders per annum. There is currently no procedure in place which mentions the need to compare the pre- and post-implementation data. This highlighted the importance for a new verification procedure. Case studies were used to verify the new procedure which was then validated by comparing theoretical calculations and installed capacity ratings. The verification procedure had a significant impact on the overall accuracy ratings of the projects. Master...|$|R
