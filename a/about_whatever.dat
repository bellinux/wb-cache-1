5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E
25|$|A wholehearted cricketer who bustled <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> he did, Brearley's batting fame {{rested on}} his hurried {{walk to the}} wicket and the much-told Old Trafford story that, {{at the sound of}} him scurrying to the wicket, the horse walked between the shafts of the heavy roller ready {{for the end of the}} innings. In all cricket, he took 844 wickets but scored only 908 runs.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 40 rivers {{rise in the}} BMNP area, {{contributing}} to five major rivers: the Web, Wabe Shebele, Welmel, Dumal and Ganale. Additionally, the Bale massif is the source for many springs in the lowlands, which are of paramount importance as {{they are the only}} source of water year-round. People living south of the national park are completely dependent on good management of the water resources from the highland areas. If the flow of these rivers is altered in any way – through deforestation, overgrazing of pastures and/or over abstraction for irrigation (all of which are occurring at present) – a highland/lowland imbalance results with loss of perennial water in the lowlands. If such a situation arises, the dry season range of the people and their livestock reduces dramatically and they concentrate <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> water source remains. It is widely recognized that such uneven distribution of people and livestock leads to rapid and lasting degradation. The people are, therefore, likely to become increasingly food-aid dependent if the water catchment areas of the Bale Mountains are insufficiently protected. There is already evidence that over abstraction of water in the Bale Mountains is occurring.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, the HPA ran {{a massive}} fundraiser {{to support those}} in dire need after the tragic event of the Haiti earthquake. Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those {{a part of the}} Harry Potter Fandom) {{performed}} and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up for bid were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor Tom Felton, handmade earrings from actress Evanna Lynch, and a one thousand word story <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> the winner wishes it to be written by Maureen Johnson and John Green. The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane fulls of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans. Ophelia Dahl, the daughter of the late British author Roald Dahl was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal.|$|E
500|$|Mike Portnoy's {{drumming}} received praise. [...] "Mike Portnoy {{continues to}} amaze with his adaptability, playing perfectly with just <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> style of music," [...] Blogcritics noted. Björnsen commended Portnoy's performance, noting that [...] "He delivers driving rhythms when appropriate, {{and has a}} more laid back approach when necessary". Batmaz praised Portnoy for [...] "displaying admirable restraint": [...] "Free is perhaps his most minimalistic side, because of the thick atmosphere on the album, but at any rate, his performance his spectacular". Blogcritics praised Vera's bass parts as [...] " [...] extra strength and depth to the rhythm section." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite their {{appreciation}} of his work, many of Glicken's associates considered him eccentric and highly disorganized. Chatty, noted for being extremely sensitive, Glicken also paid meticulous attention to detail. One {{of his friends}} writes, [...] "Harry was a character his whole life.... Everyone who knew him was amazed {{he was such a}} good scientist." [...] Regarding Glicken's driving habits, the same acquaintance describes him as [...] "a cartoon character" [...] who [...] "would drive at full speed down the road, talking <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> was important to him, and... come to a four-way stoplight and he'd sail through it, never knowing he'd just gone through".|$|E
500|$|Clarkson wrote [...] "Sober" [...] {{after her}} friend Calamity McEntire {{gave her the}} line [...] "pick her weeds and keep the flowers". The singer said the lyrical content is about {{survival}} and {{knowing what to do}} when something goes wrong. [...] "It's not easy getting over whatever your addiction may be," [...] she says. [...] "The whole point of that song is, the temptation is there, but I'm not going to give in to it." [...] When asked if the lyrics were regarding a drinking problem, Clarkson responded, [...] "I'm not an alcoholic; that's not what it's about. It's just a metaphor. Everyone has something they are addicted to that they can do without in their life, so it could be <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> your addiction is." ...|$|E
500|$|The College Dropout diverged {{from the}} then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop {{in favor of}} more diverse, topical {{subjects}} for the lyrics. Throughout the album, West touches on a number of different issues drawn from his own experiences and observations, including organized religion, family, sexuality, excessive materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, and personal struggles. Music journalist Kelefa Sanneh wrote, [...] "Throughout the album, Mr. West taunts everyone who didn't believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap". West explained, [...] "My persona is that I'm the regular person. Just think <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> you've been through in the past week, and I have a song about that on my album." [...] The album was musically notable for West's unique development of his [...] "chipmunk soul" [...] production style, in which R and soul music samples were sped up and pitch shifted.|$|E

500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first time I can really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E
500|$|As cricket {{correspondent}} for the Yorkshire Post, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his writing style: he wrote [...] "with a fountain pen on press telegram forms at 60 or 80 words a shilling. At the close of play he immediately concluded his essay; he hardly ever crossed anything out. His cricketing judgments were assured and rigorous, his style exact but sometimes elegant: Leyland's bowling is a joke {{but it is an}} extremely practical joke." [...] The Times stated that his reports were [...] "always precise, frequently elegant, sometimes stern and invariably fair and accurate. He never wrote an unpolished piece or an unidentifiable one, although he was only occasionally analytical." [...] The speed and ease with which he produced his reports, and his refusal to use a typewriter—which he described as [...] "the devil's own invention"—were envied by other journalists. Kilburn's writing was printed exactly as he wrote it; sub-editors did not touch anything, even if he had made a mistake, as his employers valued his style so greatly. He refused to write about off-field events which caused consternation for his editors as Yorkshire cricket was turbulent behind the scenes at the time he wrote. Nor would he write about the wider aspects of cricket, confident that his reputation made it impossible to sack him. This attitude made him popular with the players, and he became particularly close to Len Hutton and Donald Bradman. His position at the Yorkshire Post gave him freedom to write <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> he chose, and he refused several offers to move to national newspapers. But his obituary in The Times suggested that, had he worked for a London publication, he would have been as well-known and respected as Cardus, E. W. Swanton and R. C. Robertson-Glasgow.|$|E

2500|$|Freud's {{clinical}} work {{eventually led}} him to the conclusion that more consistent and effective symptom relief, compared to that achieved by using hypnosis, could be obtained by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition, <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> ideas or memories occurred to them. In conjunction with this procedure, which he called [...] "free association", Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of repression which underlay symptom formation. By 1896, Freud had abandoned hypnosis and was using the term [...] "psychoanalysis" [...] to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based.|$|E
2500|$|Blackman {{is adamant}} that musicality {{has nothing to}} do with gender. [...] "The gender {{question}} is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with gender", Blackman says. [...] "I'm there because I love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green." [...] "There are people who have opinions <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion", says Blackman. [...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In terms of my goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't." ...|$|E

And I was delighted because she was going out {{with the head of the}} studio. She could have been the biggest pain in the ass alive. And I would be in a terribly awkward position if she started with the limousines and the special means and whatever the hell it is—or complaining <b>about</b> <b>whatever.</b> But never a peep out of her. Most pleasant, most charming, very cooperative, very hard-working. She was always there half an hour before her call and she always stayed on for a half hour just in case.

2500|$|While at Stanford, Thiel {{encountered}} René Girard, whose mimetic theory influenced him. Mimetic theory {{posits that}} human behavior {{is based upon}} mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: [...] "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that {{we have all the}} amazing achievements of the modern world," [...] but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: [...] "rivals are more apt to forget <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another." [...] Thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures, stating: [...] "The big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, and while we get better at the things we're competing on, we lose sight of anything that's important, or transcendent, or truly meaningful in our world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interactivity {{has become}} a term {{for a number of}} new media use options {{evolving}} from the rapid dissemination of Internet access points, the digitalization of media, and media convergence. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information. Such a definition replaces the [...] "one-to-many" [...] model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a [...] "many-to-many" [...] web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> he or she chooses. Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In [...] "What is new media?" [...] Vin Crosbie (2002) described three different kinds of communication media. He saw Interpersonal media as [...] "one to one", Mass media as [...] "one to many", and finally New Media as Individuation Media or [...] "many to many".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} each week, each housemate is {{required}} to sit down and be interviewed about the past week's events. Unlike the normal day-to-day taping, these interviews, which are referred to as [...] "confessionals," [...] involve the subject looking directly into the camera while providing opinions and reflective accounts of the week's activities, which are used in the final, edited episodes. The producers instruct the cast to talk <b>about</b> <b>whatever</b> they wish, and to speak in complete sentences, to reinforce the perception {{on the part of the}} home viewer that the cast is speaking to them. Winick described this practice as [...] "like therapy without the help." [...] The confessionals were originally conducted by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray, but were eventually delegated to production staff members like George Verschoor and Thomas Klein. Beginning with the second season (Los Angeles), a small soundproof room was incorporated into each house for this purpose, which itself has also become known as the Confessional. (The soundproofing practice appears to have been discontinued in later seasons.) ...|$|E
