5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E

5000|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{plays an}} important role in the survival and adaptability of a species. When a population's habitat changes, the population may have <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> survive; the ability of the population <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> the changing environment will determine their ability to cope with an environmental challenge. Variation in the populations gene pool allows natural selection to act upon traits that allow the population <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> changing environments. The more genetic diversity a population has, the more likelihood the population will be able <b>to</b> <b>adapt.</b>|$|R
