5|$|After the attack, the non-Serb {{civilian}} {{population in the}} village and the surrounding area was persecuted. They were forced to flee their homes, as they would have been imprisoned, physically <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> killed if they did not. After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged high-ranking SAO SBWS and Serbian officials, including Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić, with war crimes committed in Dalj. The killings were extensively covered by German media leading to forming of a public opinion in support of Croatia. By the end of 1991, Germany adopted support for diplomatic recognition of Croatia as its policy and duty.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{mephedrone}} is {{not specifically}} listed as illegal, but is controlled under legislation that makes compounds illegal {{if they are}} analogs of drugs already listed. In Australia during 2010, it was not specifically listed as prohibited, but the Australian Federal Police stated it is an analogue to methcathinone and therefore illegal. It is now listed as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. In February 2010, 22 men were arrested in connection with importing mephedrone. By January 2011, every state in Australia, other than Victoria, had listed it as a controlled drug.|$|E
40|$|Policy It is {{the policy}} of the Chittenden South Supervisory Union and its member school districts (Charlotte, Hinesburg, Shelburne, Williston and Champlain Valley Union) to ensure that all CSSU {{employees}} report suspected child abuse and/or neglect as outlined in 33 V. S. A. § 4911 et seq. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to protect children whose health and welfare may be jeopardized by <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect. It is further the purpose of this policy to make clear to all district employees and school officials that it is not their role to be investigator, judge and jury in cases of suspected <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect. Rather, it is the role of district employees to be faithful and timely reporters of suspected <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect so that allegations can be {{brought to the attention of}} objective, trained and experienced investigators. Definitions 1. Immediately means as soon as the <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect is suspected but in no case later than 24 hours after such <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect is suspected. 2. Suspected means the school district employee has reasonable cause to believe <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect occurred. This does not mean that the employee must be convinced the <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> neglect occurred...|$|R

50|$|As {{demonstrated}} by the chart below, numerous studies have examined factors which mediate substance <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence. In these examples, the predictor variables lead to the mediator which in turn leads to the outcome, which is always substance <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence. For example, {{research has found that}} being raised in a single-parent home can lead to increased exposure to stress and that increased exposure to stress, not being raised in a single-parent home, leads to substance <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence. The following are some, but by no means all, of the possible mediators of substance abuse.|$|R
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> improperly applied.|$|E
25|$|Drug misuse and non-medical use {{include the}} use of drugs for reasons or at doses other than prescribed. Opioid misuse can also include {{providing}} medications to persons for whom it was not prescribed. Such diversion may be treated as crimes, punishable by imprisonment in many countries. In 2014, almost 2 million Americans <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> were dependent on prescription opioids.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Patrick left Texaco {{to become}} the Executive Vice-President, General Counsel and Secretary at The Coca-Cola Company.

Patrick concluded the allegations to be unsubstantiated and untrue, but counseled that the company allow an independent inquiry to lay all questions to rest. After initially supporting Patrick's view, then-CEO Douglas Daft changed his mind, precipitating Patrick's decision to leave Coke.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Some {{studies have}} found that high levels of impulsivity and {{sensation}} seeking, particularly disinhibition are associated with substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia, as in the general population. However, no study has assessed impulsivity and sensation seeking specifically in schizophrenia patients with alcohol <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence. Material and Methods: We compared impulsivity and sensation seeking in a group of schizophrenia patients (DSM-III-R criteria) with lifetime alcohol <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence (n= 34) and in a group without lifetime substance <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence (n= 66). The patients were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for DSM-III-R disorders, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), the Zuckerman Seeking Sensation Scale (SSS), and the Physical Anhedonia Scale (PAS). Results: The mean scores for impulsivity and sensation seeking were higher in the group with lifetime alcohol <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence than in the group without substance <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence (BIS: 63. 4 SD: 18, 7 vs 51. 3 SD: 14. 2 respectively, ANOVA: F= 11. 12, p= 0. 001; SSS: 17. 6 SD: 5. 9 vs 13. 5 SD: 6. 7 respectively, ANOVA: F= 7. 45, p= 0. 008). There was {{no significant differences between the}} two groups on PAS score. Conclusion: Increased impulsivity or sensation seeking may be a link between schizophrenia and alcohol <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> dependence...|$|R

25|$|Partially {{because of}} the {{population}} pressures, property crime became a business both for the criminals and those who fed off of the criminals. Major crime lords like Jonathan Wild invented new schemes for stealing, and newspapers were eager to report crime. Biographies of the daring criminals became popular, which spawned fictional biographies of fictional criminals. Cautionary tales of country women abused by sophisticated rakes (such as Anne Bond) and libertines in the city were popular fare, and they prompted fictional accounts of exemplary women <b>abused</b> (<b>or</b> narrowly escaping abuse).|$|E
25|$|Before the {{conflict}} began, Bosniaks in Eastern Bosnia {{had already begun}} to be removed from their employment, to be ostracised and to have their freedom of movement curtailed. At the outset of the war, Serb forces began to target the Bosniak civilian population. Once towns and villages were secured, the military, the police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers continued these attacks. Bosniak houses and apartments were looted or razed to the ground, the civilian population were rounded up, some were physically <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> murdered during the process. Men and women were separated and then held in concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|Located in Irvington, but {{not part}} of the regular public school district, was the Abbott School, which served homeless, neglected, <b>abused,</b> <b>or</b> developmentally {{disabled}} boys in grades 2 through 9.

25|$|The 1790s saw the {{beginnings}} of moral treatment being introduced for people with mental distress. The concept of a safe asylum, proposed by Philippe Pinel and William Tuke, offered protection and care at institutions for patients who had been previously <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> enslaved. In the United States, Dorothea Dix was instrumental in opening 32 state asylums to provide quality care for the ill. Dix also {{was in charge of}} the Union Army Nurses during the American Civil War, caring for both Union and Confederate soldiers. Although it was a promising movement, attendants and nurses were often accused of abusing or neglecting the residents and isolating them from their families.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA) is an {{agreement}} between the government of Canada and approximately 86,000 Native Canadians who at some point were enrolled as children in the Canadian Indian residential school system, a system which was in place between 1879 and 1996.. The IRSSA recognized the damage inflicted by the residential schools and established a $2 billion compensation package for all former IRS students and, in particular, {{those who had been}} <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> otherwise harmed. The agreement, announced in 2006, was the largest class action settlement in Canadian history. As of December 2012 a total of $1.62 billion has been paid to 78,750 former students.|$|E

When she left the mule's handler was coaxing him in a soothing manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an old horse.|$|E
