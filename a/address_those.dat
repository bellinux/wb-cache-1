5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Carey did not <b>address</b> <b>those</b> rumours until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who may be unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially <b>address</b> <b>those</b> concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo ID cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach {{to the study of}} history that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact that}} it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to <b>address</b> <b>those</b> difficulties.|$|E

500|$|Breyer noted Lara's other arguments, but as {{the double}} {{jeopardy}} issue was dispositive, he declined to <b>address</b> <b>those</b> issues. He did note that [...] "we are not now faced with a question dealing with potential constitutional limits on congressional efforts to legislate far more radical changes in tribal status." [...] The decision allowed both courts to prosecute Lara. Since separate sovereign bodies had filed the charges, double jeopardy {{did not apply to}} Lara's case.

It features {{the names of}} LGBT and other minority communities, which {{was due to the}} support Gaga had received from the community over the years. She also explained that since The Fame and The Fame Monster did not directly <b>address</b> <b>those</b> communities, [...] "Born This Way" [...] was her chance to create something that not only supported her political and social beliefs, but also empowered her to artistically say, [...] "'I'm not being safe with this record.'

The current expansion plan was approved in the year 2000 under Law 670 and has seen the creation of Line H, as well as the extensions of Line A and Line B westwards and Line E northwards. However, in 2015 an alternative plan has been proposed which would make numerous amendments to the Law 670 plan.|$|E
500|$|Ryūjō ( [...] "Prancing Dragon") {{was a light}} {{aircraft}} carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the early 1930s. Small and lightly built {{in an attempt to}} exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, she proved to be top-heavy and only marginally stable and was back in the shipyard for modifications to <b>address</b> <b>those</b> issues within a year of completion. With her stability improved, Ryūjō returned to service and was employed in operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During World War II, she provided air support for operations in the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, where her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea. During the Indian Ocean raid in April 1942, the carrier attacked British merchant shipping with both her guns and her aircraft. Ryūjō next participated in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands in June.
