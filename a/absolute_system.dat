25|$|The {{observational}} method applied to consciousness {{gives us the}} science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, {{on the one hand}} from the deductive construction of notions of an <b>absolute</b> <b>system,</b> as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E

2500|$|For {{coherence}} {{theories in}} general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence {{is taken to}} imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is {{a critical factor in}} judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system. [...] A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole. [...] Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ {{on the question of whether}} coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single <b>absolute</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The British Association unit of {{electrical}} resistance, on {{which was founded}} the first practical approximation to absolute measurement on the system of Gauss and Weber, was largely due to Jenkin's zeal {{as one of the}} originators, and persevering energy as a working member, of the first Electrical Standards Committee. The experimental work of first making practical standards, founded on the <b>absolute</b> <b>system,</b> which led to the unit now known as the British Association ohm, was chiefly performed by Clerk Maxwell and Jenkin. [...] The realisation of the great practical benefit which has resulted from the experimental and scientific work of the Committee is certainly in a large measure due to Jenkin's zeal and perseverance as secretary, and as editor of the volume of Collected Reports of the work of the Committee, which extended over eight years, from 1861 till 1869. The volume of Reports included Jenkin's Cantor Lectures of January, 1866, 'On Submarine Telegraphy,' through which the practical applications of the scientific principles for which he had worked so devotedly for eight years became part of general knowledge in the engineering profession.|$|E

The fourth (tRAS) is often omitted, or a fifth, the Command rate, sometimes added (normally 2T or 1T, also written 2N, 1N). These parameters specify the latencies (time delays) that affect speed of random access memory. Lower numbers usually imply faster performance.

50|$|Boström further {{accounts}} for the factors that constitute individual self-consciousness or the person. I contrast to the Hegelian notion of an original abstract, empty self-consciousness which, through sensible reality, actualizes itself into a fully conscious and determined (concrete) spirit, Boström maintains that the absolute person is primordial and eternally fully determined. It has its sensations fully present to itself, and does not require for its perfect determination an imperfect world. There exists no exclusion or contradiction among the sensations or ideas of God, but there is complete accord among them, {{so that it is}} impossible to conceive perfectly either of God or of any of His ideas without also conceiving the others perfectly. Boström has thereby shown that absolute reality is an <b>absolute</b> <b>system,</b> a spiritual organism in the strongest sense of the term.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>absolute</b> block <b>system</b> {{enables the}} safe working of trains between manual signal boxes. As power {{signalling}} installations are implemented covering a wide area of control, manual signal boxes are gradually being supplanted, and the <b>absolute</b> block <b>system</b> is now mostly confined to limited {{areas of the}} network that carry lighter and slower traffic (there are exceptions, such as the Great Western main line through much of Cornwall). As noted above all Network Rail RUSs point to lines where absolute block signalling is a bar to increased services (both passenger and freight trains). The problem is made worse by rationalisation in the 1960s which closed signal boxes and made some absolute block sections of considerable length.|$|R
40|$|This chapter re-evaluates {{the notion}} of {{absolute}} Frame of Reference (FoR) in spatial language. It reassesses Levinson’s widely accepted definition of absolute FoR as involving bearings that are fixed, abstract and arbitrary, and that absolute FoR involves a binary relation. The chapter argues instead that absolute FoR is a ternary relation, not a binary one, and that <b>absolute</b> <b>systems</b> need not be fixed, and are not definitionally abstract or arbitrary. It argues that Levinson’s definition is stipulative, and that a range of operationally identical systems exist, some of which conform to Levinson’s criteria, others of which do not. It presents a new operationally-based definition of absolute FoR which may be applied consistently {{across a range of}} spatial systems whose status in terms of FoR have been controversial or difficult to categorize. The chapter presents evidence that rather than an arbitrary abstract relation, absolute spatial references involve an anchor point or points in the external world. Formulating this as a Topographic Correspondence Hypothesis, the paper argues that <b>absolute</b> spatial <b>systems</b> are not merely anchored in, but motivated, at least in part, by the external physical environment. The paper concludes by proposing an Environment Variable Method to test this hypothesis...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{he favored}} a {{departure}} from the <b>absolute</b> <b>system</b> of Metternich, Bach was not prepared to go so far as the Revolutionaries of 1848 wished. In his views, he has been called a man who was 'quite wonderfully unprincipled' and so could change his position often. [...] This allowed him to be driven into conservative ranks by popular opposition: he gradually adhered to conservative views, endorsing the centralizing constitutional program of Prince Schwarzenberg in March 1849, thus further inflaming Hungarian sentiments. [...] However, the impact of his reforms on Hungary has been the contest of many historical debates. Some viewed the Revolution as far more productive in recreating the Hungarian [...] "national identity", whereas some contemporaries of later Hungarian revolutions saw the systems created by Bach as the foremost driver in Hungarian nationalism.|$|E
5000|$|Published in 1916, Ferdinand de Saussure's Course in General Linguistics {{describes}} {{language as}} [...] "a {{system of signs}} that express ideas". [...] de Saussure describes two components of language: langue and parole. Langue consists of the structural relations that define a language, which includes grammar, syntax and phonology. Parole is the physical manifestation of signs; in particular the concrete manifestation of langue as speech or writing. While langue can be viewed strictly as a system of rules, {{it is not an}} <b>absolute</b> <b>system</b> such that parole must utterly conform to langue. Drawing an analogy to chess, de Saussure compares langue to the rules of chess that define how the game should be played, and parole to the individual choices of a player given the possible moves allowed within the system of rules.|$|E

50|$|In 1968 {{came the}} {{analysis}} of Leroi-gourhan, who proposed a rather general chronology, which broadly was in agreement with González Echegaray. In both publications the decorations of the entire Gallery A and the first sub-sanctuary of Room XI are placed at the very start of Style III; whereas the second sub-sanctuary of the same room should be placed within the earliest Style IV.

Recently, {{as a result of}} being able to apply <b>absolute</b> <b>systems</b> of dating to the paintings, it has been demonstrated that the style-classification proposed by Leroi-Gourhan, and some relative dating of other investigators, is shaky.|$|R
