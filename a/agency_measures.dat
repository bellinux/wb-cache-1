A distinction between explicit judgement of agency and implicit feeling of agency has been proposed theoretically. However, there has not been sufficient experimental evidence to support this distinction. We have assessed separate explicit and implicit <b>agency</b> <b>measures</b> in the same population and investigated their relationships. Intentional binding task was employed as an implicit measure and self-other attribution task as an explicit measure, which are known to reflect clinical symptoms of disorders in the sense of agency.

Caltrans wanted to understand performance measures and data used by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and transit agencies to help it develop statewide measures. This report serves as a summary reference guide to help Caltrans understand the numerous and diverse performance measures used by MPOs and transit agencies in California. First, investigators review the available literature to identify a complete transit performance framework for the purposes of organizing <b>agency</b> <b>measures,</b> metrics, and data sources. Next, they review the latest transit performance measures documented in planning reports for the four largest MPOs in California (San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Sacramento). Researchers pay special attention to the transit performance measures used by these MPOs, because these measures are available for the majority of California’s population. Finally, investigators summarize 231 performance measures used by a total 26 local transit agencies in the State of California, based on transit planning documents available on the internet...|$|E

40|$|The {{sense of}} agency (SoA) {{refers to the}} phenomenal {{experience}} of initiating and controlling an action, whereas the sense of ownership (SoO) describes the feeling of myness an agent experiences towards {{his or her own}} body parts. SoA has been investigated with intentional binding paradigms, and the sense of ownership (SoO) with the rubber-hand illusion (RHI). We investigated the relationship between SoA and SoO by incorporating intentional binding into the RHI. Explicit and implicit measures of agency (SoA-questionnaire, intentional binding) and ownership (SoO-questionnaire, proprioceptive drift) were used. Artificial hand position (congruent/incongruent) and mode of agent (self-agent/other-agent) were systematically varied. Reported SoO varied mainly with position (higher in congruent conditions), but also with agent (higher in self-agent conditions). Reported SoA was modulated by agent (higher in self-agent conditions), and moderately by position (higher in congruent conditions). Implicit and explicit <b>agency</b> <b>measures</b> were not significantly correlated. Finally, intentional binding tended to be stronger in self-generated than observed voluntary actions. Results provide further evidence for a partial double dissociation between SoA and SoO, empirically distinct agency levels, and moderate intentional binding differences between self-generated and observed voluntary actions...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} about the {{application}} of procedural approaches in the US-Zeroing case that serve to highlight potential problems with Appellate Body decision-making. Those problems go to central issues of judicial restraint, including concerns surrounding standards of review, appellate fact-finding, and notions of justiciability and ripeness. This essay will begin with an analysis of US-Zeroing 2 ̆ 7 s approach in applying the specialized standard of review under the Antidumping Agreement, arguing that it fails {{to adhere to the}} obligation of deference to permissible Member State interpretations of WTO antidumping obligations. It then examines the fact-finding procedures applied by the Appellate Body, which raise troubling concerns about the Appellate Body 2 ̆ 7 s failure to confer deference to the reasonable factual findings of Member States and WTO panels. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of the Appellate Body 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of the mandatory/discretionary doctrine, a key tool that restricts the jurisdictional authority of the WTO. The essay concludes that the Appellate Body in US-Zeroing circumvented the particularized standard of review required under the Antidumping Agreement, took upon itself the unacceptable task of appellate fact-finding, and inappropriately expanded the authority of WTO panels to hear facial challenges of <b>agency</b> <b>measures.</b> Rather than adhere to an approach of deference as required by the WTO commitments, the Appellate Body engaged in de novo review of both the law and the facts to reach its preferred result on zeroing...|$|E

40|$|Some Members of Congress have {{expressed}} concern about whether the Social Security Administration (SSA) has adequate resources to manage its workloads. The agency has struggled to provide quality service to the public. Backlogs in the disability programs have caused widespread concern. SSA’s efforts to ensure the accuracy of benefit payments have declined. Many applicants and beneficiaries have experienced long waits at field offices and on the phone. SSA’s workloads are growing as the population increases, the baby boomers retire, the economic situation worsens, and the agency takes on new and more complex responsibilities. SSA’s primary workload is administering the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs. In addition, SSA provides substantial administrative support to Medicare and other programs, and partners with the Department of Homeland Security in verifying employment eligibility. The resources SSA has to meet its growing workloads include funding, staff, infrastructure, and management. In recent years, SSA’s administrative funding has increased, but has generally fallen short of requests by the SSA Commissioner and the Bush Administration. SSA’s FY 2008 appropriation {{was the first time}} that Congress appropriated at or above the President’s budget request in over ten years. SSA’s staffing levels have decreased overall and fluctuated among the specialized staff who manage key workloads; at the same time, SSA’s productivity has increased, according to <b>agency</b> <b>measures.</b> The agency has gradually modernized its technological infrastructure and made efforts to streamline its processes, but independent analysts have argued that these initiatives fall short of what is needed to meet SSA’s growing workloads. Congress could facilitate changes at SSA through the appropriations and oversight processes. Options for congressional action include changing the amount of SSA’s administrative expenses and how they are financed. For example, the Social Security Advisory Board (SSAB) has recommended that Congress increase funding for SSA’s administrative expenses, arguing that the agency does not have adequate resources. The board has also suggested excluding SSA’s administrative costs from discretionary spending caps. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended dedicating funds for program integrity. Congress could also use its oversight powers to encourage more effective management at SSA in areas such as implementing technological improvements, streamlining processes, and recruiting and retaining key staff. Congress could decide not to take any action. However, inaction would likely have consequences. As SSA’s workloads increase, it is unlikely that the agency would be able to reduce the backlogs in the disability programs, and possible that the backlogs would grow further, resulting in longer waits for potential beneficiaries. Managing growing workloads could also preclude efforts to maintain or increase the program integrity activities that are projected to save the Social Security and SSI programs money in the long run. Customer service problems could be difficult to address in the absence of additional staff or resources. Finally, SSA’s outdated computer systems pose security risks and are vulnerable to collapse, according to outside experts. This report provides an overview of SSA’s workloads, resources, and service delivery, as well as issues for Congress. It does not cover H. R. 1 and S. Amdt. 98, which are intended to provide a stimulus to the economy.
