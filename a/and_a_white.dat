5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the land for centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is generally agreed that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane. Initially, this entailed only a symbolic payment. Tradition identifies this as a snowball supplied at midsummer <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a token of mutual esteem.|$|E
5|$|Also {{starting}} in September 1906 was {{the publication of}} the revival's own newsletter, the Apostolic Faith. Issues were published occasionally up until May 1908, mostly through the work of Seymour <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> woman named Clara Lum, a member of the Apostolic Faith Mission. The Apostolic Faith was distributed without charge, and thousands of laypersons and ministers received copies worldwide. Five thousand copies of the first edition were printed, and by 1907 the press run reached over 40,000.|$|E

The college also features acoustic shooting, a sport which uses air rifles fitted with photoelectric cells which convert light reflected from targets into sound.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, all of Marquis' {{works were}} out of print. However, the Wooden Leg {{narrative}} was reprinted as Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought Custer in 1962 by the University of Nebraska Press. In 1967 Marquis' daughters published his collected pamphlets as Custer on the Little Bighorn. Part of his Cheyenne book was published as The Reminiscences of Four Indians <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> Soldier in 1973, and Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was reprinted in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Clarence Edward Smith {{was born}} on February22, 1928, and raised in Danville, Virginia, with his five {{brothers}} and one sister. During his childhood, Virginia was racially segregated, and he witnessed incidents of racism, including a fight between his father <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man that was sparked by racial tensions. In 1946, he moved with his mother to New York City, where they settled in Harlem. He attended only two years of high school.|$|E

5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Dodd was one {{of three}} actors in Wind, a short film portraying the pursuit of an old Aboriginal man (Dodd) by a young black tracker <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> police sergeant.

Later, Dodd played minor roles in an episode of television series The Alice (2006) and the movies My Country (2007) and Broken Sun (2008); by this time his career in film and television had lasted for over sixty years.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings are bronze-yellow suffused in parts with fuscous <b>and</b> with <b>an</b> antemedial <b>white</b> band, defined by black formed by a bar from the costa to the median nervure, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> oblique wedge-shaped patch from the cell {{to the inner}} margin. There is <b>a</b> small <b>white</b> discoidal lunule defined by black <b>and</b> <b>a</b> postmedial <b>white</b> band defined by black from the costa to vein 4, its inner edge sinuous and expanding at and below the costa. There is also <b>a</b> conical <b>white</b> patch defined by black from below {{the end of the}} cell to the inner margin <b>and</b> <b>a</b> subterminal <b>white</b> band defined by black and excurved and interrupted at the middle. The hindwings are bronze-yellow suffused in parts with fuscous <b>and</b> with <b>an</b> ill-defined <b>white</b> subbasai band <b>and</b> <b>an</b> antemedial quadrate <b>white</b> patch defined by black from the costa to the median nervure, with <b>a</b> narrow <b>white</b> band defined by black from it to the inner margin <b>and</b> <b>a</b> postmedial curved <b>white</b> band defined by black from the costa to vein 4, its inner edge sinuous and expanding at and below the costa.

There are three conjoined spots between veins 7 and 4 and two spots towards the tornus.|$|R
5|$|Late that evening, a two-coach staff train {{pulled out}} of Brill, {{accompanied}} by a band playing Auld Lang Syne <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> flag. The train stopped at each station along the route, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the tramway to the Metropolitan Railway main line were ceremonially severed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} the genus Lactarius are also similar: The {{tropical}} African Lactarius chromospermus has a superficial resemblance to L.volemus, but the former species, {{in addition to its}} African distribution, can be identified by its cinnamon-brown spore print—unique in the Russulaceae. Lactarius subvelutinus is also similar to L.volemus, but lacks the fishy odour, has a dull yellow-orange to bright golden orange cap, narrow gills, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> latex that does not change colour.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} or wood nuthatch (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe, where its name is the nuthatch. Like other nuthatches, it is a short-tailed bird with a long bill, blue-grey upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal bird with a repeated loud dwip call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in {{the west of the}} range have orange-buff underparts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, and those in the Far East have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat.|$|E

5|$|The Smyth Report {{was issued}} by the US War Department on 12 August 1945, giving {{the story of the}} atomic bomb and {{including}} the technical details that could now be made public. It made few references to the British contribution to the bomb, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> Paper, Statements Relating to the Atomic Bomb was hurriedly drafted by Michael Perrin. This account was issued just after Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister, and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{standards}} of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot {{at the base of}} the tail <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.|$|E
