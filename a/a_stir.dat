5|$|The letter caused <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in {{the upper}} echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter.

Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack is not his dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, conveying the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, {{and he needs to}} stay away from them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} use of static mixers as a reactor for {{the extraction of}} indium from sulphate solutions was investigated. The experimental work was focused on "Kenics" type static mixers, since these were found simplest and cheapest among a variety of models, and yet yielded acceptable preliminary results with low pressure drop along the reactor. A series of experiments {{was carried out in}} <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> continuous flow reactor to compare the results. It was found that under certain (different) conditions both reactors perform satisfactorily. The energy consumption of a static mixer is of the same order of magnitude as that of <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> vessel. The most significant achievement of the experimental work is establishing that the residence time in a static mixer is about two orders of magnitude less than that in <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> reactor...|$|R

5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{the loss of}} Franklin's {{expedition}} inspired a number of paintings in both the United States and Britain. In 1861, Frederic Edwin Church unveiled his great canvas The Icebergs; later that year, prior to taking it to England for exhibition, he added {{an image of a}} broken ship's mast in silent tribute to Franklin. In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes caused <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, dioramas, and magic lantern shows.|$|E
5|$|North of the Alps, Army Group G {{followed}} suit on 6 May. Kesselring now decided to surrender his own headquarters. He ordered Hausser {{to supervise the}} SS troops {{to ensure that the}} surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at Saalfelden, near Salzburg, in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, the commander of the 101st Airborne Division, who treated him courteously, allowing him to keep his weapons and field marshal's baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at Zeltweg and Graz unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and his staff to move into a hotel at Berchtesgaden. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring drinking tea together created <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the United States. Kesselring met with Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, and gave interviews to Allied newspaper reporters.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E

5|$|Casualties were {{light on}} both sides; Révolutionnaire lost five men killed and four wounded, {{including}} Thévenard {{who had suffered}} minor wounds, while Artois was the only British ship engaged, losing two sailors and a lieutenant of Royal Marines killed and five men wounded. Pellew's squadron brought Révolutionnaire back to Falmouth immediately, having discovered an outbreak of small pox among the prisoners of war taken from the French frigate. Subsequently, the light damage the ship had suffered enabled the Royal Navy to rapidly purchase and commission the frigate as the 38-gun HMS Révolutionnaire {{under the command of}} Captain Francis Cole and attach the ship to Pellew's squadron. Eighteen months later, Révolutionnaire fought and captured the French frigate Unité at the Action of 12 April 1796, and remained in the Royal Navy throughout the following 21 years of warfare. The arrival of Révolutionnaire in Britain caused <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among naval architects as the frigate was significantly larger than those produced in Britain at the time. The ship was extensively planned and modelled and a ship was commissioned for the Royal Navy to the design of Révolutionnaire, although severe delays at the shipyards meant that HMS Forte, as the ship was eventually named, was not launched until 1814.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such <b>a</b> <b>stir.</b> I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s {{manufacturers}} such as Hummel and Adidas {{began to}} design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology {{led to the}} introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies in pharmaceutical drug production requires the highest technology {{be invested in}} obtaining a stable, high producing cell line. Currently the most common method of selection is by limiting dilution cloning, done in well plates. The highest producing cell is chosen after samples from the stationary plates have been analyzed for antibody production. The selection is based on stationary culture, even though after scale-up cells will grow in <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> environment. This research investigates a way to test multiple clones in <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> environment by using high throughput bioreactors (HTBRs) {{in the early stages}} of clone selection. It has been found that simply selecting subclones based on results from stationary culture could result in the chance of missing even higher producing clones.

50|$|The {{starting}} materials {{can sometimes be}} cooled before the reaction {{to such an extent}} that the reaction heat is absorbed without further cooling of the mixture. In the case of gaseous or low-boiling {{starting materials}}, work under overpressure is necessary. Due to the large number of possible raw materials, a large number of processes have been described. Photochlorination is usually carried out in <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> tank reactor, <b>a</b> bubble column reactor or a tube reactor, followed by further processing depending on the target product. In case of <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> tank reactor, the lamp (generally shaped as an elongated cylinder) is provided with a cooling jacket and placed in the reaction solution. Tube reactors are made from quartz or glass tubes, which are irradiated from the outside. Using <b>a</b> <b>stirred</b> tank reactor has the advantage that no light is lost to the environment. However, the intensity of light drops rapidly with the distance to the light source due to adsorption by the reactants.|$|R
