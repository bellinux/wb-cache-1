40|$|Full text of {{this book}} chapter is not {{available}} in the UHRA. The question {{of the extent to}} which perception is cognitively penetrated is an ambiguous one. Perception can be understood as a process occurring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> vehicles (V-perception) or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> content (C-perception) and the factors that are understood as necessary or sufficient for answering the question var accordingly. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> vehicles, <b>the</b> architecture in which perceptual processes are implemented, the issue is: to what extent is visual perception informationally encapsulated? That is, to what extent are the processes that properly constitute visual perception modified by informational input from non-perceptual cognitive vehicles? <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> content, <b>the</b> issue is (roughly) : to what extent is perceptual content conceptually structured and/or theory impregnated. The primary focus of this paper is the question <b>of</b> cognitive penetrability <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> vehicles. However, this question cannot be decided in the absence of a proper understanding <b>of</b> perception <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> content. It will be argued that proper appreciation of the extended character of C-perception - the way in which such perception is extended both out into the world and through time - reveals most attempts to defend the cognitive impenetrability of V-perception to be misguided...|$|R
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part.

In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eleventh thoracic vertebra.

5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual organism or gene, or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{arise from}} the subclavian artery, and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, {{three quarters of the}} artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E

5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady {{reduction in the number of}} nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

40|$|It {{seems to}} be a common and {{intuitively}} plausible assumption that conversational implicatures arise only when one of the so-called conversational maxims is violated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> what is said.

Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally.

5|$|The {{back margin}} of the {{zygomatic}} plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars.

The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo.

Poor use of land value caused the development to be reassessed in 1983/4, when it was decided to retain the existing six-road exit throat and 18-platform layout, in combination with resignalling; this resulted in a station confined to the Liverpool Street site, with ground space released for development. In 1985 British Railways signed an agreement with developers Rosehaugh Stanhope and work on the office development, known as Broadgate, began.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is narrow and extends back to the front margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused.
