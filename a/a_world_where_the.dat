5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many {{projects}}—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> war between good and evil has been fought with evil coming out on top, and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E

25|$|According to the article, some {{contemporary}} {{ministers and}} theologians chose {{to focus on}} the life and teachings of Jesus, rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran dangerously close to ethical humanism. Biblical literalism, on the other hand, might have had an appeal to the fervent believer, but did not speak to most people in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> language of the Bible was increasingly unfamiliar.|$|E
25|$|In the Presence of Mine Enemies (2003) is an {{alternate}} history novel by American author Harry Turtledove, expanded from the eponymous short story.

The novel depicts <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> United States remained isolationist and {{did not participate in}} the Second World War, thus allowing victory to the Axis Powers, who divided the world among themselves. Still, some years after the war, the Third World War occurred, featuring the Axis Powers defeating the US and Canada.|$|E

25|$|The 1819 Hamburg {{controversy}} signified a new {{pattern of}} thought {{on the part}} of the conservatives, one that the rabbi of Pressburg already embraced. Their polemics were not a mere continuation of legalistic argumentation, but a self-conscious, concerted backlash intended to safeguard the very authority of tradition. As such, most historians regard it to be the beginning of Orthodox Judaism as a modern movement, a defined, beleaguered perception which could not merely perpetuate old modes of thought. It had to defend itself actively against encroaching deviation in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> rabbis lacked all their old legal means of enforcement.|$|E

25|$|Newman {{believed}} {{in a middle}} way between free thinking and moral authority – one that would respect the rights of knowledge {{as well as the}} rights of revelation. His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, {{it would have to be}} a place in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.|$|E
25|$|The 1996 Virgin Missing Adventures novel The Scales of Injustice by Gary Russell also {{explores the}} events {{surrounding}} Liz's resignation from UNIT.

500|$|In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, [...] "I love Jane Austen. She's romantic, intelligent, {{and full}} of humor. … The {{parallel}} is also quite obvious in that 'Fill the Void' takes place in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> rules are rigid and clear. The characters are not looking for some way to burst out of that world. Instead, {{they are trying to}} find a way to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in Fill the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E
500|$|... is an {{animated}} music video created by Studio Ghibli {{for the song}} [...] "On Your Mark" [...] by the Japanese rock duo Chage & Aska. The song was released in 1994 {{as part of the}} single [...] "Heart". In 1995, Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the short film for the song as a side-project after having writer's block with Princess Mononoke. The anime music video is non-linear, providing multiple reiterations and alternate scenes to depict the events. The music video added sound effects to the audio track, but contains no dialogue. Miyazaki purposely misinterpreted the lyrics to present his vision of <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> surface becomes inhospitable and humans live in an underground city. He made the video cryptic to evoke creative interpretations among viewers.|$|E

500|$|Kneale {{also sought}} to make [...] "a comment on {{television}} {{and the idea of}} the passive audience", depicting <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> media is controlled by an elite who feed the population with a diet of low-quality programmes and echoing the Orwellian concept of language reduction, where vocabulary has been eroded through exposure to advertising slogans, mediaspeak and predominantly visual media. He later recalled, [...] "I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that people are now conditioned to image. The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do a lot of thinking, and if you had a verbally reduced society, you would get the kind of language—possibly—that you did get in the play".|$|E
500|$|Doppelgänger {{is given}} a rating of two-and-a-half stars out of five in a {{negative}} review published on the Film4 website, which praises the effects work and costume design but criticises the scenes with the character of Dr Hassler for their irrelevance to the main plot, and the subtext of the Rosses' troubled marriage as an unnecessary diversion from the narrative. Although Ross and Kane's mission through space {{is described as a}} [...] "brief, trippy light show", the review questions the originality of having a parallel Earth as the focus, and the depth of the script's vision: [...] "Anderson's has to be the cheapest alternate Earth ever. Whereas audiences might expect <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire never fell or the Nazis won World War II, here the shocking discovery is that people write backwards. That's it." [...] Doppelgänger is only recommended for fans of the Anderson productions, and is considered [...] "an occasionally interesting failure".|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was {{generally}} negative about the film, stating, [...] "The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen {{holes in the}} plot {{as well as by}} reams of exposition" [...] and that it was [...] "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." [...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> stars don't shine." ...|$|E
