5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} her this story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest song in the world.

5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these problems, the wide fan-shaped signal presented serious problems when more than one aircraft entered the beam. In this case, the bearing readout would <b>always</b> <b>say</b> it was mis-aligned, and {{it was impossible for}} the range readers to know which aircraft they were measuring. Even the most experienced crews were unable to satisfactorily track a target in these conditions.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked who}} the models for her characters, Loos would almost <b>always</b> <b>say</b> they were {{composites}} of various people, but when pressed, admitted that toothless flirt Sir Francis Beekman was modeled after writer Joseph Hergesheimer and producer Jesse L. Lasky. Dorothy Shaw was modeled after herself and Constance Talmadge, and Lorelei herself most closely resembled acquisitive Ziegfeld showgirl, Lillian Lorraine, {{who was always}} looking for new places to display the diamonds bestowed by her suitors.|$|E

Analysts deemed it a victim of poor timing and [...] "a severe miscalculation of how to attract an audience." [...] Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of Warner Bros. at the time, explained, [...] "People <b>always</b> <b>say</b> to me, 'Why don't you make smarter family movies?' The lesson is, Every time you do, you get slaughtered." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{he wrote}} the novel, Fleming used aspects {{of his life to}} flesh out the details, much as he did with many of his Bond stories. Thus, in the novel, one of the {{children}} was called Jemima, after the daughter of his previous employer, Hugo Pitman; the advice Pott gave to his children also echoed that of Fleming: [...] "Never say 'no' to adventures. <b>Always</b> <b>say</b> 'yes', otherwise you'll lead a very dull life." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group B, along with Italian club Inter Milan, Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia and Ukraine's Dynamo Kyiv. Wenger {{believed}} the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's {{chances of winning}} the Premier League: [...] "The other English teams have more comfortable groups than we do. It is tough to go to Russia – I <b>always</b> <b>say</b> {{that if you have}} to travel more than two hours it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches." ...|$|E

[...] and [...] "I'm saying Stop", he evidently does not use it, as [...] "Stop" [...] is never a [...] "safeword". Rather, this is a reference to the episode Lady Heather's Box, in which she reminds Grissom that the submissive is in control; Grissom tells her when they begin kissing, [...] "You can <b>always</b> <b>say</b> stop," [...] and she replies, [...] "So can you." ...|$|E
500|$|Growing up in a Jewish-American {{household}} {{where the}} parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though {{in his case}} many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star. The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should be doing {{in favor of a}} more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write The Phantom Tollbooth. Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage [...] "Expect everything, I <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> and the unexpected never happens" [...] was a favorite of the cartoonist's mother.|$|E

The state park calls itself [...] "The Only City of Live Mermaids" [...] and was extremely {{popular in the}} 1960s, drawing almost one million tourists per year. Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified Scuba divers. [...] They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic ballet (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls. Children often ask if the [...] "mermaids" [...] are real. The park's PR director says [...] "Just like with Santa Claus or any other mythical character, we <b>always</b> <b>say</b> yes. [...] We're {{not going to tell}} them they're not real".|$|E

500|$|... "Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song. King said [...] "that's fine" [...] when speaking of the situation, noting [...] "there are songs {{that he wants to}} play that I always shoot down". [...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and just do the last half.'

During the public meeting, one resident proposes putting Crazy from the Heat, the autobiography of Van Halen lead vocalist David Lee Roth, into the time capsule. When Andy and Eduardo bond, they find they are both fans of Dave Matthews Band, an American jam band.

These five shorts were [...] "Good Night", which was featured in its entirety, and portions of [...] "The Perfect Crime", [...] "Space Patrol", [...] "World War III", and [...] "Bathtime".

500|$|Spielberg kept most of {{the parts}} secret in the filmmaking, as {{the cast and crew}} were left {{confused}} about how the aliens looked. When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, [...] " [...] wouldn't give [...] to anybody". Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, [...] "I know some people who <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh, everything's so secret.' I think it's good. In the old days people didn't get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there's just so much information. I think a bit of mystery is always really good. You don't want to blow all of your cards beforehand." ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, who is Jewish, {{and whose}} father is Jewish {{while his mother}} is Catholic, has become a {{prominent}} figure in the Jewish community, and enjoys the attention that he attracts from it.

He joined, among others, teammate Scott Feldman, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis.

500|$|In 1981, music {{magazine}} the NME {{described the}} album as darker and more passionate than 1980's Crocodiles. The Record Mirror {{also said that}} the band sang the blues and devoted themselves to existential sadness. They went on to note that the album offered [...] "an anatomy of melancholy, resplendent with the glamour of doom". Melody Maker disagreed when in 1981 they said [...] "the Bunnymen are continuing to play majestic, uplifting music that will shine through the dark days ahead of us". In the 2002 book Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen, author Chris Adams said that in 1995 McCulloch had said, [...] "That spikey edge [...] still stands up." [...] In relation to their style of music, in 1980 McCulloch had said, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>say</b> 'We're a rock band'. Because I'm proud of that." [...] He added, [...] "I like rock music [...] I prefer being good or great within that basic format [...] I just prefer basic songs." ...|$|E
