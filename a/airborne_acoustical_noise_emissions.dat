40|$|<b>Acoustical</b> <b>noise</b> {{data were}} {{collected}} on small wind turbines used for water pumping [...] different blade designs were tested on each wind turbine. Three different blade designs were tested on 1 kW wind turbines and each successive blade design was shown to produce less noise with respect to rotor speed. All three blade designs, however, produced <b>acoustical</b> <b>noise</b> above 80 dB during part of their operation due to wind turbine blade fluttering which occurred when a specific rpm was exceeded for each blade design. Two radically different blade designs were tested on a 10 kW wind turbine. For the loaded condition (online) the average <b>acoustical</b> <b>noise</b> measured for both blade designs was within a few dB of each other (noise under 70 dB), but for the unloaded condition the average <b>acoustical</b> <b>noise</b> measured for the newer blade design was 4 to 8 dB less. The <b>acoustical</b> <b>noise</b> for both blade designs of the 10 kW wind turbine usually ranged between 70 and 80 dB in the offline condition, but occasionally exceeded 80 dB. Binning the measured sound data in terms of rotor or tip speed instead of wind speed greatly reduced the scatter in the data and enabled better evaluation of the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> for the different blade designs.

Since diamond grinding has been observed to affect tyre/pavement <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> favourably, the relationship among surface texture, concrete composition and <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of concrete pavement surfaces has been systematically investigated. The simulation program SPERoN was used in a parameter study to investigate the main factors which affect <b>noise</b> <b>emission.</b> Based {{on the results of}} the simulations, textured concrete surfaces were produced by using a laboratory grinding machine. As well as the composition of the concrete, the thickness and spacing of the diamond blades were varied. The ability of the textured surfaces to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> was assessed from the texture characteristics and air flow resistance of textured surfaces measured in the laboratory. It was found that concrete composition and, in particular, the spacing of the blades affected the reduction in <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> considerably. The <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> behaviour of numerous road sections was also considered in field investigations. The pavement surfaces had been textured by diamond grinding during the last years or decades. The results show that diamond grinding is able to provide good, durable noise-reducing properties. Several new pavement sections were investigated using thicknesses and spacings of the blades similar to those used in the laboratory to optimize <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> reduction.

At the A 10 motorway near Amsterdam, a slight {{decrease in the}} noise reduction of the pavement was found. Here {{it was found that}} the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of wet porous road surfaces is significantly higher than the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> at dry weather conditions and that rainfall can incidentally increase noise levels up to 5 dBA. The results for the N 256 motorway at Colijnsplaat in Zeeland in 2005 are in agreement with 2004 and show a discrepancy in measured and calculated <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> for all vehicle categories. At this site during rainfall the traffic <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> increased with approximately 1, 5 dBA. The <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> of heavy trucks here are almost independent of temperature. Furthermore there is a large variation in vehicle <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> within the distinguished categories. In March of 2006, a small sample set of additional measurements was therefore carried out at the Amsterdamsestraatweg in Utrecht in order to gain further insight into these variations.

40|$|The {{conventional}} SVPWM algorithm gives {{good performance}} {{for control of}} induction motor drive, but it produces more <b>acoustical</b> <b>noise</b> resulting in increased total harmonics distortion. The random pulse width modulation (RPWM) techniques has become an established means for mitigation of undesirable side effects in PWM converters, the use of voltage source inverters in adjustable speed ac drives in particular. Hence, to minimize these anomalies of the drive, this paper presents a novel variable delay random pulse width modulation (VDRPWM) algorithm with constant switching frequency for direct torque controlled induction motor drive. The Simplicity of this technique is its easy implementation and requires only low-end processors. The conventional VDRPWM preserves both the quality switching of the conventional space-vector PWM (SVPWM) method and minimized harmonic mitigation of the variable switching frequency PWM technique.
