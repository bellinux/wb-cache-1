500|$|Sources {{disagree}} as to {{the exact}} origins of the Manipuri pony, although all agree that it was derived from ancient stock. One source gives the ancestors of the pony as Tibetan ponies brought into India over a thousand years ago, while another states their origins to be a cross between the Mongolian Wild Horse and the Arabian, brought to India by invading Tartar tribes, who also brought the equestrian game of polo. Manipuri ponies have been bred for centuries in the Manipur area of northeast India. The first written mention of the breed dates to <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>statement</b> in the 1584 Manipur Royal Chronicle. By the early 1600s, the breed was mentioned frequently in Manipur literature. They were often used as cavalry horses, and were ridden by Meitei warriors. Manipuri ponies played a major part in the cavalry commanded by Garib Newaz, whose horsemen terrorized upper Burma throughout the early 1700s and in 1738 were used during his Sack of Sagaing. Between 1859 and 1916, Manipuri ponies were extremely desired by the British for playing polo, and there were further infusions of Arabian blood in the 19th century, as British administrators and military officers sought to upgrade their polo ponies. The height of polo horses was initially restricted to , based on the average height of the Manipuri, and although this restriction was later relaxed to [...] and then removed altogether, demand for Manipuris was so high that the area was drained of them. At one point during this period, the export of ponies from Manipur was banned to allow the breed time to increase in number to a viable level.
