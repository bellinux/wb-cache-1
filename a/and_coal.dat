5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over the future of the pipelines. The major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad <b>and</b> <b>coal</b> companies, who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal <b>and</b> <b>coal</b> gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} at 700 - 1500 ºC on the mechanical strength, micro strength and pore structure of carbonaceous materials, including coke, char <b>and</b> <b>coals,</b> were studied using tensile test, ultra micro indentation and image analysis. Strength of chars <b>and</b> pyrolysed <b>coals</b> was strongly enhanced by heat treatment at temperature below 1100 °C; strength of cokes was slightly degraded after heat treatment at 1500 °C. Mechanical strength of carbonaceous materials was demonstrated {{to be significantly}} affected by micro strength and porosity. Micro strength of chars <b>and</b> <b>coals</b> was significantly enhanced by heat treatment, whereas micro strength of cokes was only marginally increased by heat treatment. The major growth in the micro strength of chars <b>and</b> <b>coals</b> took place at annealing temperature below 1100 °C. Porosity of chars <b>and</b> <b>coals</b> significantly increased during annealing at temperatures below 1100 °C. Further increasing annealing temperature from 1100 - 1500 °C caused marginal porosity evolution in pyrolysed <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> chars. Porosity of cokes increased slightly in the temperature range of 1300 - 1500 °C...|$|R

5|$|The offset boiler <b>and</b> <b>coal</b> bunker {{caused the}} locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank <b>and</b> <b>coal</b> chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E
