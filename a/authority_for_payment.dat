5|$|Milton Hay desired {{that his}} nephew go to Washington as a {{qualified}} attorney, and John Hay {{was admitted to}} the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861. On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington. By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery. When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing a shabby bedroom. As there was only <b>authority</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year, seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day. As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11 pm (or later, during crucial battles) the burden on his secretaries was heavy.|$|E
60|$|These gentlemen {{complain}} of hardship. No considerable number shows discontent; but, {{in order to}} give satisfaction to any number of respectable men, who come in so decent and constitutional a mode before us, let us examine a little what that hardship is. They want to be preferred clergymen in the Church of England as by law established; but their consciences will not suffer them to conform to the doctrines and practices of that Church: that is, they want to be teachers in a church to which they do not belong; and it is an odd sort of hardship. They want to receive the emoluments appropriated for teaching one set of doctrines, whilst they are teaching another. A church, in any legal sense, is only a certain system of religious doctrines and practices fixed and ascertained by some law,--by the difference of which laws different churches (as different commonwealths) are made {{in various parts of the}} world; and the establishment is a tax laid by the same sovereign <b>authority</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of those who so teach and so practise: for no legislature was ever so absurd as to tax its people to support men for teaching and acting as they please, but by some prescribed rule.|$|E

Custom duties and income tax were also collected. By 1884, the tribute was {{replaced}} by the cedula personal, wherein everyone over 18 were required to pay for personal identification. The local gobernadorcillos were responsible for collection of the tribute. Under the cedula system taxpayers were individually responsible to Spanish <b>authorities</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of the tax, and were subject to summary arrest for failure to show a cedula receipt.|$|R

30|$|Certificate chains {{have been}} used in the {{literature}} to support degrees of accountability of authorisation [16]–[18]. The micro-billing scheme [16] uses KeyNote to help determine whether a micro-check (a KeyNote credential, signed by a customer) should be trusted and accepted as payment by a merchant. In [17], delegation credentials are used to manage the transfer of micropayment contracts between public keys; delegation chains provide evidence of contract transfer and ensure accountability for double-spending. The mechanisms that underly these schemes are similar to our service-reselling example in that there can be misinterpretation as to which principal (bank) originates the permission (<b>authority</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment).</b> These systems are also vulnerable to delegation subterfuge (leading to a breakdown in accountability) if care is not taken to properly identify the permissions indicating the payment authorizations when multiple banks and/or provisioning agents are possible.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report reviews whether the DC government {{had the authority to}} use $ 18 million from the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance <b>Authority</b> <b>for</b> severance <b>payments</b> during fiscal year 2000. GAO concludes that the District lacked the authority to use the $ 18 million in Section 157 funding for the fiscal year 2000 workforce reduction. District officials told GAO that they believed that they had the Financial Authority's approval to use 157 funding and, consequently, spent $ 14. 3 million during fiscal year 2000 on workforce reduction activities. However, the District could not document that the Financial Authority had certified compliance with the requirements of Section 157 to authorize the use of the funds. The Financial Authority maintains that it did not approve the use of the funds by the District and had denied in writing the District's request for reimbursement <b>for</b> severance <b>payments.</b> The District accounted for the workforce reduction costs during fiscal year 2000 as if it had access to the Section 157 funding. The District concluded that, had the Section 157 funding been unavailable, one agency would have ended fiscal year 2000 with an operating deficit and two agencies would have experienced increases in their existing operating deficits. As a result, the District may have potential Anti-Deficiency Act violations. ...|$|R

It describes all steps and conditions necessary to establish and carry on the business according to the Czech legislation (i. e. registration with competent <b>authorities,</b> <b>payments</b> <b>for</b> health and social insurance, tax payments). The major part of the thesis deals with the main entrepreneur's obligation - keeping an evidence in order to calculate the individual income tax. This evidence can be in the form called "tax evidence" based on cash basis (in other word it means evidence of incomes and expenditures). One chapter also deals with the question of the transition between the tax evidence and the accounting. The last chapter shows a practical example of keeping tax evidence, calculating tax liability and height of the insurance including completed forms...|$|R

40|$|Thesis Abstract The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, which {{was adopted by}} the Regulation No. 1896 / 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (ES) {{creating}} a European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, adopted on 12 December 2006. This thesis describes events preceding the adoption of the Regulation, the procedure of adoption of the Regulation, as well as, development of the content of individual provisions of the Regulation and the content of the actual adopted and binding Regulation. In this thesis, the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure is also compared with nati- onal orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures in the Czech Republic, France and Germany. The selection of these three countries was not unintentional. The Czech Republic was chosen because the thesis was written in the Czech language, in the Czech Republic and shall also be published in the Czech Republic, therefore the author believes the majority of potential readers know the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> better than any other order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure. This aspect was also the main reason why the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> is described {{at the beginning of this}} thesis. The German and French orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures were chosen because the European Commission claims the French " injonction de payer" and the German " [...] ...|$|R
