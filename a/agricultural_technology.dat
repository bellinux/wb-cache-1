5|$|Gia Long {{abolished}} all large landholding by princes, nobles {{and high}} officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials and rewarding or endowing nobles with {{a portion of}} the taxes from a village or a group thereof. Existing highways were repaired and new ones constructed, with the north-south road from Saigon to Lạng Sơn put under restoration. He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in <b>agricultural</b> <b>technology,</b> so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in <b>agricultural</b> <b>technology</b> during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
30|$|There {{are also}} {{indirect}} {{benefits associated with}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies.</b> As argued by Minten and Barrett (2008), <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> {{have the potential to}} enhance food security for all sections of the poor including nonfarm households. It also improves nutrition security of net food buyers due to fall in real food prices as supply outpaced demand due to productivity improvement (Evenson and Gollin 2003; Karanja et al. 2003). Improvement in productivity due to <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> may also increase the demand for labor, which increases earnings for landless laborers (Kassie et al. 2011; Bezu et al. 2014). <b>Agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> could also stimulate overall economic growth through inter-sectoral linkages (Sanchez et al. 2009). Hence, as argued by Streeten (1987), <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> can benefit both producers and non-producers of developing countries.|$|R

Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments, including a U.S. Supreme Court justice. He enhanced {{the powers of the}} presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York, starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated <b>agricultural</b> <b>technology,</b> an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reform, eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur, as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. On July 2, 1881, he was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington D.C. by Charles J. Guiteau, a lawyer and writer with a grievance. The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but his doctors' uncleaned and unprotected hands are said to have led to infection that caused his death on September 19. Guiteau was convicted of the murder and was executed in June 1882; he tried to name his crime as simple assault by blaming the doctors for Garfield's death. With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days, and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack, Garfield is little-remembered for other than his assassination. Historians often forgo listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency.|$|E

Eighty farmers of the selected village Ashrafpur under of Meherpur district constituted the sample of the study. Data were collected by interviewing the farmers using personal interview schedule during the period from August to September, 2013. Among these eighty respondents 37. 5 % had low, 51. 25 % respondents had medium and only 11. 25 % of the respondent had high knowledge about modern <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies.</b> While 35 % respondents had low, 55 % respondents had medium and only 10 % had high knowledge about environmental degradation.

The direct effects of <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> include productivity improvements and lower average production costs, which can improve the livelihood of rural households by increasing their income. The role of <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> in reducing poverty and food insecurity, improving wellbeing and increasing farm income has been widely researched by (Khonje et al. 2015; Shiferaw et al. 2014; Zeng et al. 2015; Asfaw et al. 2012; Kassie et al. 2011; Becerril and Abdulai; 2010; Alene et al. 2009; Minten and Barrett 2008).

Precision agriculture was a major shift in technology that occurred in the 1980s. The result was tractors that farmers drove with the aid of GPS devices and on-board computers. Precision agriculture focuses on maximizing returns while using minimum resources. With the aid of GPS devices and computers, farmers could use tractors more efficiently.|$|E

A second crop is planted in a similar way in July and is ripe in November.’ (Ibid). The influence of sweet potatoes and taro has been vast. They are still widely present in modern-day Taiwan, be it on the streets, night markets, or in successful food chains like ‘Meet Fresh’ (or 鮮芋仙).|$|E

This supported the larger population and enabled culture to flourish.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{deals with}} the links between <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> and {{tropical}} deforestation {{in order to determine}} whether and how the REDD. + mechanism (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) might address agriculture expansion on forests. We study in the first place the Borlaug/land sparing hypothesis, according to which an increase in agricultural productivity per hectare leads to reduced cultivated areas, or at least is a prerequisite for such an outcome, but we find serious limitations when translated in economic terms. Further confrontation with empirical results from case-studies confirms the lack of robustness of the land sparing hypothesis: various kinds of changes in <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> in various contexts generate various types of impacts on forest cover. Increasing productivity per hectare can be done in many ways and has uncertain consequences on forest cover. Public support policies need to be funded in priority to guarantee that agricultural land reforms work in favour of reducing deforestation. Subsequently, we study the strategies that were elaborated by five countries in the framework of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, which is a prominent supporter of REDD+-readiness. Their analysis shows the poor reflection in these national strategies of the academic debate/research results on the impact of <b>agricultural</b> <b>technologies</b> on deforestation. This gap between science and policy making deserves recognition for improvement, if one wishes most effective use of this new and unprecedented source of finance for reversing the tropical deforestation.
