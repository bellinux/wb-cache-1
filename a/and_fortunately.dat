25|$|Biggs was {{nominated}} {{to run for}} Governor in 1886, <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> for him, {{it was the last}} year such a disparity existed between the parties. For the last time there was no Republicans candidate, and he received only the token opposition of the Temperance Reform Party candidate, James R. Hoffecker, whom he defeated easily. Biggs served from January 18, 1887 until January 20, 1891. Two years later the Republicans began their long road back and took advantage of splits in the Democratic leadership to elect a small majority in the State House. Meanwhile, Biggs did as countless governors before him, and pleaded with the General Assembly for all kinds of reform, including better representation for New Castle County, and reform of the voting procedures. And as usual, he was largely ignored, except for a provision to establish a State Hospital for the Insane, now the Delaware State Hospital at Farnhurst.|$|E
25|$|With {{help from}} Baroaba who stays {{to care for}} the ill José, Paifu and Maruyama finally reach the summit of the mountain. They then {{encounter}} the witch's servant, an oni named Leonardo. After solving a riddle, they are allowed to meet the witch <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> retrieved the influenza medicine. On the way down the mountain, Maruyama accidentally slips and falls off. Paifu makes a daring rescue by learning flight at the last minute and saves Maruyama and himself from immediate death. On the way back, Maruyama talks of how he is going to buy a boat with the money he makes forcing Paifu to reveal that he had lied to him about the payment of 1,000,000 yen. Maruyama admits that he is disappointed, but not infuriated as Paifu saved his life. The four are praised as they returned to the village. One month later, Paifu, Jose and everyone else from the village meet Maruyama out at sea with a ghost boat that all fixed up together.|$|E
25|$|From {{that time}} she was an indefatigable reader, troubling her parents only by her devotion to books {{rather than to the}} play natural to her age. Her father had a {{considerable}} library, the contents of every book in which she made her own, always preferring history, — before she had finished her 10th year being acquainted with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and kindred writers. At this point, she was sent away to school. Her father and mother, seeing the intellect for which they were responsible, took all possible pains with her education, <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. She cared more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no especial pleasure in mathematics. Booth's superior education was not given her at school, where she learned less than she did by herself, for she showed very young that disdain of obstacles and that taste for literature which were two strong points in her character. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French. A stray French primer fell into her hands, and she became interested in spelling out the French words and comparing them with the English ones, and continued to study in this way. Later she acquired German in the same manner, and being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she never learned to speak them, but made herself so proficient in them in after years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French at sight, reading them aloud in English.|$|E

500|$|Robert Louis Stevenson made Norton a {{character}} in his 1892 novel, The Wrecker. Stevenson's stepdaughter, Isobel Osbourne, mentioned Norton in her autobiography, This Life I've Loved. She said that Norton [...] "was a gentle and kindly man, <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> {{found himself in the}} friendliest and most sentimental city in the world, the idea being 'let him be emperor if he wants to.' San Francisco played the game with him." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in the press pack for the production, Lyndhurst described Freddie Robdal as [...] "a villain – charming, but nasty", and comparing him to Rodney, said that: [...] "They're from two entirely different suitcases as far as I'm concerned. I didn't want to bring into it anything that I'd already done with Rodney <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> there wasn't any opportunity to do so. They're like chalk and cheese." [...] Speaking about the 19-day filming schedule and the [...] "not great" [...] budget, he also told Michael Deacon of The Daily Telegraph that: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Youngblood {{authored}} (with Joel Engel) his autobiography, Blood. The book outlined Youngblood's {{drive and}} passion for professional football and reviewed his career, his injuries, his successes, and his failures {{on the football}} field. The book recounts when, between the 1973 and 1974 seasons, Youngblood traveled to Logan, Utah, to help Rams teammates Merlin and Phil Olsen with their summer football camp. An altercation {{in the parking lot}} of a local pub resulted in Youngblood having a [...]44 pistol stuck in his eye and the trigger pulled <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> the chamber was empty, although other chambers were not. A cut eyelid was the only injury he sustained. After initially pleading innocent, the assailant later pleaded guilty and received a one-year suspended sentence. The book was favorably reviewed by Publishers Weekly as [...] "an unusual sports book".|$|E

500|$|Karen Gillan {{had to wear}} a latex {{prosthetic}} stomach bump for {{the scenes}} which depicted Amy as pregnant. She claimed {{it made her feel}} more mature and act ridiculously, and cited it as her favourite part of filming the series. Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory, which was trimmed to look [...] "more masculine" [...] and pulled back in a ponytail. The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths. The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine-inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder, and then again with Linder's stunt double, whom he was allowed to hit. There was only one prop of the plank, <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{conflicts}} and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities. Star Trek: The Original Series addressed {{issues of the}} 1960s, just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism, {{and the role of}} technology. Roddenberry stated: [...] " [...] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, Vietnam, politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on Star Trek: we were sending messages <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> they all got by the network." [...] "If you talked about purple people on a far off planet, they (the TV network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing" ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira's {{record label}} at that time, Epic Records, opposed the {{decision}} to release and commission Laundry Service as they [...] "wanted her just to throw a couple of songs in English on a Latin record." [...] Estefan argued with Tommy Mottola, then head of Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Epic Records), and convinced him to release the album, arguing that an [...] "American audience" [...] would not buy a Spanish record simply due to its inclusion of a few English tracks. In an interview with Latina, she said [...] "I got in the trenches there with Tommy [...] - I fought for that. Because they didn't believe it. Just like they told us [...] They were trying to think in the box and I wanted to take {{her out of the}} box. <b>And</b> <b>fortunately,</b> Tommy, whom I love and adore and is a good friend, he really listened to me." ...|$|E

50|$|As {{the demand}} for more {{government}} office space increased, three major extensions were added in 1880, 1904-1909 <b>and</b> 1920. <b>Fortunately,</b> {{every one of these}} extensions were faithful to McNair's Neo-Palladian design and the building maintained a harmonious overall look.|$|R
500|$|The {{characteristics}} of the breed as known today {{are thought to have}} been established by the late 15th century, after the Crusaders returned to England, with Arab stallions from the Middle East. In the 16th century, King Henry VIII, thinking to improve the breeds of horses, particularly war horses, ordered the destruction of all stallions under [...] and all mares under [...] in the Breed of Horses Act 1535. The laws for swingeing culls of 'under-height' horses were partially repealed by a decree by Queen Elizabeth I in 1566 on the basis that the poor lands could not support the weight of the horses desired by Henry VIII because of [...] "their rottenness ... are not able to breed beare and bring forth such great breeds of stoned horses as by the statute of 32 Henry VIII is expressed, without peril of miring and perishing of them", <b>and</b> (<b>fortunately</b> for the future of Britain's mountain and moorland pony breeds) many ponies in their native environments, including the Welsh breeds, therefore escaped the slaughter.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E
500|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 17 January, Tshombe and Munongo met with UN officials in Élisabethville to finalize negotiations. They concluded with Tshombe signing a formal instrument of surrender with General Prem Chand and acting UN Civilian Chief George Sherry, officially ending the Katangese secession. Four days later he peacefully received UN troops in Kolwezi. Thant sent a congratulatory message to the peacekeeping forces, declaring that the conflict had been [...] "forced upon [...] ", adding that [...] "it was only after all other efforts failed that the order was given to undertake defensive action of removing the hostile gendarmerie roadblocks which has now been completed so successfully <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> {{with a minimum of}} casualties." [...] All the various political concerns about what ramifications a UN attempt to crush the secession might cause, such as a drawn-out guerrilla war or power vacuum, were virtually resolved with the successful conclusion of Operation Grandslam. Most of the international community was satisfied with the result, including the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.|$|E

500|$|The Singles 1992–2003 was {{generally}} well received by music critics. Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody described the album as [...] "a real joy {{for anyone who}} has a taste for Gwen Stefani's yearning vocals and her band's uncanny ability to mix ska, teen pop and hip-hop." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the album a [...] "stellar collection", concluding that it is [...] "the kind of compilation that satisfies fans of all stripes and converts skeptics. It's the greatest-hits package that [...] deserve." [...] Anthony Thornton of NME stated, [...] "Despite being an album packed with as much drama as the band themselves have suffered, it'll be the pop anthems you come back for <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> there's enough here to keep even the soap addicts happy." [...] Sara McDonnell of musicOMH wrote that the album's music had [...] "sheer diversity" [...] due to the band's [...] "pick 'n mix approach to musical styles". The high points were [...] "Gwen Stefani's lyrics, which deal principally with {{coming to terms with}} her own femininity" [...] and [...] "the band's collaborations with various hip producers", such as The Neptunes, Nellee Hooper and Sly and Robbie; and the low points were the album's [...] "hotch-potch feel", [...] "random tracklisting" [...] and the [...] "forays into reggae". Ruth Mitchell of the BBC Music viewed the album as a typical Christmas album that was [...] "unlikely to stand out from the crowd" [...] and [...] "too long, [...] tiresome about half way through", although complimenting [...] "Just a Girl", [...] "Hey Baby" [...] and [...] "Underneath It All". However, she also expressed disappointment at the placement of [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "the foursome's most glorious pop moment", {{at the end of the}} album. The Rolling Stone Album Guide later gave the album four stars out of five.|$|E

2500|$|Professional British jazz {{musician}} and former Jazz FM presenter, Digby Fairweather in 2006 {{wrote an article}} on the, at the time, upcoming British jazz radio station, theJazz.

2500|$|... "The {{rumors of}} a coup to oust Chávez," [...] noted The Miami Herald, [...] "were being whispered, if not shouted, for months before the revolt."

[...] On the evening of 11 April, with the coup in full swing, one coup plotter, Colonel Julio Rodriguez Salas, told television viewers that the coup had been long planned: [...] "Nine months ago a movement started to organise itself more firmly, a serious movement, <b>and</b> <b>fortunately</b> it has come to fruition today." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "New {{causes and}} fresh ideals {{were needed to}} {{revitalise}} the church, <b>and,</b> <b>fortunately,</b> they were forthcoming." [...] The nature of Newington Green had changed—the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a [...] "thriving and expanding suburb". With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty, and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. [...] A hundred years before, the ethos {{had been one of}} almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity. [...] The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839–64) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792–1870). (Like many Anglican vicars, one of his hobbies was local history.) ...|$|E
