5|$|Manila {{became famous}} during the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade, which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa and Hispanic America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia (which was already an entrepôt for goods coming from India, Indonesia and China), and vice versa. Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru was {{exchanged}} for Chinese silk, Indian gems and the spices of Southeast Asia. Likewise, wines <b>and</b> <b>olives</b> grown in Europe and North Africa were shipped via Mexico to Manila.|$|E
5|$|Their diet {{consisted}} of mainly grains and beans and in fishing communities fish was usually substituted for meat. Bread, wine, <b>and</b> <b>olives</b> were important staples of Byzantine diet with soldiers on campaign eating double-baked and dried bread called paximadion (Greek: παξιμάδιον). As in antiquity and modern times, {{the most common}} cultivations in the choraphia (Greek: χωράφια) were olive groves and vineyards. While Liutprand of Cremona, a visitor from Italy, found Greek wine irritating as it was often flavoured with resin (retsina) most other Westerners admired Greek wines, Cretan in particular being famous.|$|E

5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} prisoners who were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva <b>and</b> <b>olives.</b> Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys <b>and</b> <b>olives</b> to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E
5|$|The major cereal crops of {{the ancient}} Mediterranean region were wheat, emmer, and barley, while common {{vegetables}} included peas, beans, fava, <b>and</b> <b>olives,</b> dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats, and meat, which was consumed on rare occasion for most people, usually consisted of pork, beef, and lamb. Agriculture in ancient Greece was hindered by the topography of mainland Greece that only allowed for roughly 10% of the land to be cultivated properly, necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from Thrace (centered {{in what is now}} Bulgaria) and the Greek colonies of southern Russia. During the Hellenistic period, the Ptolemaic Empire controlled Egypt, Cyprus, Phoenicia, and Cyrenaica, major grain-producing regions that mainland Greeks depended on for subsistence, while the Ptolemaic grain market also {{played a critical role in}} the rise of the Roman Republic. In the Seleucid Empire, Mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat, while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts.|$|E

5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes <b>and</b> <b>olives.</b> In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E
5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs <b>and</b> <b>olives.</b> Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study, for {{the first}} time, evaluates the effect of <b>olive</b> <b>and</b> juniper leaves {{extracts}} and their combination on thioacetamide (TAA) -induced nephrotoxicity in male mice. The experimental mice were divided into eight groups. Group 1 was served as control. Group 2 was exposed to TAA. Group 3 was treated with TAA <b>and</b> <b>olive</b> leaves extract. Group 4 was subjected to TAA and juniper leaves extract. Group 5 was exposed to TAA <b>and</b> <b>olive</b> <b>and</b> juniper leaves extracts. Groups 6, 7 and 8 were treated with <b>olive,</b> juniper, <b>and</b> <b>olive</b> <b>and</b> juniper leaves extracts respectively. In mice treated with only TAA, significant increases of blood urea nitrogen and uric acid were observed after six weeks. Moreover, levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and uric acid were statistically increased in mice administrated with only TAA for twelve weeks. Insignificant alterations in levels of these haematobiochemical parameters were noted in other treated groups after six and twelve weeks. Histopathological evaluations of renal sections from mice treated with only TAA for twelve weeks showed severe damage of the renal corpuscles. Furthermore, the renal sections from mice treated with TAA <b>and</b> <b>olive</b> leaves extract, TAA and juniper leaves extract, TAA <b>and</b> <b>olive</b> <b>and</b> juniper leaves extracts, olive leaves extract, juniper leaves extract, <b>and</b> <b>olive</b> <b>and</b> juniper leaves extracts showed normal structures.

30|$|In {{order to}} focus on the {{measurement}} concept, we have renamed some of the schemes and combined others to remain consistent with the proposed theoretical framework. For reference to the previous research, the measurement scheme for unit fractions (MSUF) aligns with the partitive unit fraction scheme (PUFS; Steffe <b>and</b> <b>Olive</b> 2010). The measurement scheme for proper fractions (MSPF) represents a combination of the partitive fraction scheme (PFS) and the reversible partitive fraction scheme (RPFS) (Steffe <b>and</b> <b>Olive</b> 2010; also see Norton and Wilkins 2010 for an examination of the partitive fraction schemes). In previous research, these two schemes (PFS and RPFS) were investigated separately to remain consistent with the hierarchy proposed by Steffe <b>and</b> <b>Olive</b> (2010). This combination resulting in the MSPF represents a theoretical criterion for the interiorization of a scheme—that the mental actions of the scheme are both composable and reversible (Piaget 1970). Finally, the generalized measurement scheme for fractions (GMSF) aligns with the iterative fraction scheme (IFS; Steffe <b>and</b> <b>Olive</b> 2010). The naming of the part-whole scheme and the various mental actions remain consistent with Steffe <b>and</b> <b>Olive</b> (2010).|$|R

The area experienced a period of growth, with homes and businesses sprouting up in the 1880s. Agricultural development of citrus fruits, avocados <b>and</b> <b>olives</b> soon changed the landscape. By the end of 1887, land prices fell throughout San Diego County. However, the community survived on the back of its fertile agricultural lands.|$|E
25|$|Libyan cuisine derives {{much from}} the traditions of Mediterranean, North African, and Berber cuisines. One {{of the most popular}} Libyan dishes is Bazin, an unleavened bread {{prepared}} with barley, water and salt. Bazin is prepared by boiling barley flour in water and then beating it to create a dough using a magraf, which is a unique stick designed for this purpose. Pork consumption is forbidden, in accordance with Sharia, the religious laws of Islam. Tripoli is Libya's capital, and the cuisine is particularly influenced by Italian cuisine. Pasta is common, and many seafood dishes are available. Southern Libyan cuisine is more traditionally Arab and Berber. Common fruits and vegetables include figs, dates, oranges, apricots <b>and</b> <b>olives.</b>|$|E
25|$|From the Archaic to Classical period, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} of well-stocked graves establishes Tenedos's continuing affluence.

Writings from this era talk of a shortage of agricultural land, indicating a booming settlement. A dispute with the neighboring island of Sigeum was arbitrared by Periander of Corinth, who handed over political control of a swath of the mainland to Tenedos.
