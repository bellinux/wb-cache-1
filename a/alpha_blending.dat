5|$|Thief was {{developed}} with the Dark Engine, a proprietary game engine. It was written during the game's development, {{rather than as}} a separately budgeted project, which led to time constraint issues. An emphasis was placed on simulating real life physics; arrows would arc through the air rather than fly straight. The engine features <b>alpha</b> <b>blending,</b> texture filtering and lighting techniques. Motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation. The engine's renderer—which draws the graphics—was largely written by Looking Glass Studios programmer Sean Barrett in fall 1995. While the renderer was expected to be finished before the game's release date, Barrett left the company in 1996. He later performed contract work for the company, and assisted in writing features like hardware support. However, the renderer was never fully addressed, and was less advanced than others of the time.|$|E

Fully opaque clipping paths and semi-transparent masks are composited together to calculate the color and opacity of every pixel of the final image, using <b>alpha</b> <b>blending.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Xbox 360 has an {{extensive}} amount of bandwidth {{in comparison to}} its competition; however, this statistic includes the eDRAM logic to memory bandwidth, and not internal CPU bandwidths. The eDRAM internal logic to its internal memory bandwidth is 256GB/s. The high bandwidth is used primarily for z-buffering, <b>alpha</b> <b>blending,</b> and antialiasing; it saves time and space on the GPU die. Between the eDRAM die and the GPU, data is transferred at 32GB/s. The memory interface bus has a bandwidth of 22.40GB/s and the Southbridge a bandwidth of 500MB/s.|$|E

500|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{referred}} to as [...] "F-Zero on water" [...] and would feature high-speed boats, as shown in footage from the 1995 Nintendo Shoshinkai show. These boats were expected to have transforming capabilities, allowing players to switch from a stable catamaran-style form to a more streamlined canoe-style version. However, the boats were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis. According to Miyamoto, [...] "Boats looked pretty good at the show, but I didn't think that Wave Race 64 would be unique from similar games on other systems if we used boats. Jet Skis can show many maneuvers that work well in the realistic water of Wave Race 64." [...] The use of Jet Skis was suggested by Rare's Tim Stamper. The game uses the Nintendo 64's <b>alpha</b> <b>blending</b> feature to make the water simultaneously transparent and reflective.|$|E
2500|$|Windows XP {{introduced}} a new filter called the Video Mixing Renderer 7 (VMR-7 or sometimes just referred to as VMR). The number 7 was because VMR-7 only used DirectDraw version 7 to render the video {{and did not have}} the option to use GDI drawing. The main new feature of VMR-7 was the ability to mix multiple streams and graphics with <b>alpha</b> <b>blending,</b> allowing applications to draw text and graphics over the video and support custom effects. It also featured a [...] "windowless mode" [...] (access to the composited image before it is rendered) which fixed the problems with access to the window handle. VMR-7 was only officially released for Windows XP.|$|E
2500|$|The company's final {{graphics}} chips, the GD546x [...] "Laguna" [...] {{series of}} PCI/AGP 3D-accelerators, were novel {{in that they}} {{were one of the}} few video cards to use Rambus RDRAM. The patented use of tiled memory used by the GD546x chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today. However, like many other 2D/3D chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time, the feature set of perspective-correct texture mapping, bilinear filtering, single-pass lighting, gouraud shading, and <b>alpha</b> <b>blending,</b> was incomplete compared to the next generation of 3D chips. The GD546x family was limited by CPU processing at the time, CPU's could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block. The raw processing power of the GD546x was nearly 2.5 million 25 pixel triangles per second, much faster than competitors.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is the {{evaluation}} {{and analysis of the}} state of dispersion of functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs), within different morphologies formed, in a model LCST blend (poly[(alpha-methylstyrene) -co-(acrylonitrile) ]/poly(methyl-methacryla te), P <b>alpha</b> MSAN/PMMA). <b>Blend</b> compositions that are expected to yield droplet-matrix (85 / 15 P alpha MSAN/PMMA and 15 / 85 P alpha MSAN/PMMA, wt/wt) and co-continuous morphologies (60 / 40 P alpha MSAN/PMMA, wt/wt) upon phase separation have been combined with two types of CNTs; carboxylic acid functionalized (CNTCOOH) and polyethylene modified (CNTPE) up to 2 wt%. Thermally induced phase separation in the blends has been studied in-situ by rheology and dielectric (conductivity) spectroscopy in terms of morphological evolution and CNT percolation. The state of dispersion of CNTs has been evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results indicate that the final blend morphology and the surface functionalization of CNT are the main factors that govern percolation. In presence of either of the CNTs, 60 / 40 P <b>alpha</b> MSAN/PMMA <b>blends</b> yield a droplet-matrix morphology rather than co-continuous and do not show any percolation. On the other hand, both 85 / 15 P alpha MSAN/PMMA and 15 / 85 P <b>alpha</b> MSAN/PMMA <b>blends</b> containing CNTPEs show percolation in the rheological and electrical properties. Interestingly, the conductivity spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the 15 / 85 P <b>alpha</b> MSAN/PMMA <b>blends</b> with CNTPEs that show insulating properties at room temperature for the miscible blends reveal highly conducting properties in the phase separated blends (melt state) as a result of phase separation. By quenching this morphology, the conductivity can be retained in the blends even in the solid state. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|While {{the first}} Xbox's {{graphics}} processing unit was produced by Nvidia, the Xbox 360 had a chip designed by ATI called Xenos. The chip was developed under the name [...] "C1" [...] and [...] "R500" [...] was often {{used to refer to}} it. The GPU package contains two separate silicon dies, each built on a 90nm process with a clock speed of 500MHz; the GPU proper, manufactured by TSMC and a 10MB eDRAM daughter-die, manufactured by NEC. Thanks to the daughter die, the Xenos can do 4× MSAA, z-buffering, and <b>alpha</b> <b>blending</b> with no appreciable performance penalty on the GPU. The GPU also houses additional capabilities typically separated into a motherboard chipset in PC systems, effectively replacing the northbridge chip. It has a theoretical peak of 240 GFLOPS. Due to the GPU frequently overheating in early motherboard models, Microsoft revised the GPU heat sink in order to better move heat away from the GPU die though not completely.|$|E
2500|$|ClearType in WPF {{supports}} sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction anti-aliasing {{and hardware}} acceleration. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in video memory. The {{extent to which}} this is supported {{is dependent on the}} video card. DirectX 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in video memory, then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), <b>alpha</b> <b>blending</b> (application of anti-aliasing), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics including video can also be done with no computation {{effort on the part of}} the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card. [...] Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5MB per process). Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no hardware-accelerated text rendering capabilities.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to produce a {{real-time}} rendering application that incorporates depth of field, in order to simulate real world imaging more realistically. In this application the depth of field is manipulated dynamically while navigating a real-time scene. The technique to achieve this result is point-based rendering, where the scene consists {{of a large number}} of variable-sized points in 3 D space. The points are quickly rendered as vertex arrays, and a vertex shader is employed to compute the size of each point based on its circle of confusion. The points are <b>alpha</b> <b>blended</b> to produce the required transparency effect of out-of-focus points, and depth sorting of the scene ensures correct blending. The application allows the user to select focus points using the mouse, where the distance of the selected point instantly becomes the focus distance in the scene. ...|$|R

40|$|Conducting {{polymeric}} materials with stable phase microstructures have {{a range of}} potential applications. In this work, it is investigated whether phase separation in polymer blends {{can be used as a}} too] to create well dispersed conducting filler rich domains in 3 D with controlled morphology, potentially resulting in more effective percolation. The effect of amine functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (NH 2 -MWCNTs) on the thermally induced phase separation processes in poly[(alpha-methyl styrene) -co-acrylonitrilel/poly(methyl methacrylate) (P <b>alpha</b> MSAN/PMMA) <b>blends</b> was monitored by melt rheology, conductivity spectroscopy, and microscopic techniques. Electron microscopic images revealed that the phase separation resulted in a heterogeneous distribution of NH 2 -MWCNTs in the blends. The migration of NH 2 -MWCNTs is controlled by the thermodynamic forces that drive phase separation and led to an increase in their local concentration in a specific phase resulting in percolative "network-like" structure. Conductivity spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that the blends with 2 wt% NH 2 -MWCNTs that showed insulating properties for a one phasic system revealed highly conducting material in the melt state (two phasic) as a result of phase separation. By quenching this morphology, a highly conducting material with controlled dispersion of MWCNTs can be achieved. Furthermore, the role of NH 2 -MWCNTs in stabilizing the PMMA droplets against flow induced coalescence in 85 / 15 P <b>alpha</b> MSAN/PMMA <b>blends</b> was also established for the first time.

The polymer blend nanocomposite was prepared by standard melt-mixing followed by annealing above the phase separation temperature. In a two-step mixing protocol, MWNTs were initially melt-mixed with a random PS-r-PMMA copolymer and subsequently diluted with 85 / 15 P <b>alpha</b> MSAN/PMMA <b>blends</b> in the next mixing step. Mediated by the PS-r-PMMA, the MWNTs were mostly localized at the interface and bridged the PMMA droplets.
