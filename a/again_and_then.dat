5|$|Early in his career, Rosenthal {{learned the}} Transcendental Meditation {{technique}} while in South Africa, {{but found that}} as a medical student and a medical resident he didn't have time to practice. Then 35 years later, after one of his patients had a dramatic improvement {{as a result of}} TM, he began practicing <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> began recommending it to his patients. In 2011, he published , which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E
5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down {{to the size of}} a flat carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station so he could get back to his place of origin.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{plays a part}} in {{the water}} cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest of these is the Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include the Aral Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift.|$|E

25|$|A {{chemical}} in marijuana, THC, triggers {{brain cells}} {{to release the}} chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings — for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease.|$|E

25|$|The harbour head is {{a hostile}} place. Big waves from the Tasman Sea break over large sandbanks about five metres below the surface, {{two to five}} {{kilometres}} from the shore. The sand in these sandbanks comes mainly from the Waikato River. Sand discharged from this river is transported northward by the prevailing coastal currents. Some of this sand is carried into the Kaipara harbour entrance, but mostly cycles out <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> continues moving northwards along the west coast. The southern sandbanks at the entrance are constantly accumulating and releasing this sand.|$|E

25|$|In 1863, a great {{storm that}} {{occurred}} between May 4 and May 6 uncovered {{a great deal}} of the hull. It was discovered by Solomon Linnell and Alfred Rogers of Orleans. On May 9, Leander Crosby visited the Sparrow-Hawk and removed several artifacts. The rudder was few feet distant from the hull and it was removed, studied and re-assembled. By August 1863, Sparrow-Hawk was once again buried beneath the surface for a few months after which she was exposed once <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> removed above the high water mark.|$|E

The route then turns east along Alameda Ave. The route then crosses Loop 478 before crossing the unsigned I-110 and US 54 at the Patriot Freeway {{which leads to the}} international Bridge of the Americas. The route crosses US 62 at Paisano Dr. before the route turns southeast at Ascarate Park and enters the Lower Valley.|$|E

25|$|The {{researchers}} imaged spawning Atlantic herring off Georges Bank. They {{found that}} the fish come together from deeper water in the evening, shoaling in a disordered way. A chain reaction triggers when the population density reaches a critical value, like an audience wave travelling around a sport stadium. A rapid transition then occurs, and the fish become highly polarised and synchronized {{in the manner of}} schooling fish. After the transition, the schools start migrating, extending up to 40 kilometres (25mi) across the ocean, to shallow parts of the bank. There they spawn during the night. In the morning, the fish school back to deeper water <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> disband. Small groups of leaders were also discovered that significantly influenced much larger groups.|$|E
25|$|From the interchange, I-5 travels {{north and}} curved west on the {{shoreline}} of Lake Samish north of Alger, {{which is also}} the point where the freeway enters Whatcom County. After traveling west, I-5 curves north again and intersects SR 11 before entering Bellingham. In Bellingham, the highway intersects SR 542, which goes to Mount Baker, and SR 539, which goes to Lynden and British Columbia. The freeway passes the Bellis Fair Mall, Bellingham International Airport, and Ferndale before intersecting SR 548, which serves Blaine. Once in Blaine, I-5 intersects SR 543, which leads to the truck and freight border crossing. The freeway then intersects SR 548 <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> crosses the Canadian border into British Columbia as Highway99 at the Peace Arch.|$|E
25|$|In , Martin {{had another}} major {{incident}} with Jackson and it {{eventually led to}} him losing his position. On July 17 against the Kansas City Royals, Jackson came to the plate {{in the bottom of}} the tenth inning with Thurman Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on. After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off and Jackson was given the sign to swing away. Jackson bunted <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> on the third pitch he bunted again and popped out. A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but after conversing with upper management Martin agreed on a five-game suspension. Then, when Jackson returned, he told reporters that he did not know why Martin had suspended him.|$|E
