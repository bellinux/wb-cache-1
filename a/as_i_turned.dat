25|$|It {{has been}} demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist {{independently}} of the perfect in sentences like I turned this offer down, creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives. To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from. This emphasizes that the resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the passive form. However, this analysis {{does not account for}} phrases such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> this offer down, which uses the active rather than the passive voice.|$|E

But not to as much amazement as the donkey handler's– [...] I've never seen a bloke sober up so quick. It was a hole in one: the donkey {{struggled}} to its feet and looked really willing to go {{up the hill and}} the donkey handler lost his laugh.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's next notable {{role was}} the 1955 film Love Me or Leave Me, his third with Day. Cagney played Martin [...] "Moe the Gimp" [...] Snyder, a lame Jewish-American gangster from Chicago, a part Spencer Tracy had turned down. Cagney {{described}} the script as [...] "that extremely rare thing, the perfect script". When {{the film was}} released, Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney himself insisted he had not, having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped: [...] "What I did was very simple. I just slapped my foot down <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> it out while walking. That's all".|$|E

Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on the door to my left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. His mouth was twisted by the wounds and it looked like he had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E

This has been a confusion to me, for I like to think on the great things of the light and dark <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> the heads in the smoke.
