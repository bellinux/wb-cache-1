5|$|Using a {{standard}} laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, methanol-based extracts of Strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were {{shown in a}} 2000 study to have low antibacterial activity against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and low to moderate activity against the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurinA, which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977; other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood-rotting fungi, like Porcelain Mushroom for example. StrobilurinA {{is thought to be}} derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L-phenylalanine. In nature, the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source. It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria, stopping respiration by binding to the ubihydroquinone oxidation center of the bc1 complex. This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle, the spore germination stage. The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent the strobilurins from binding. Because of their sensitivity to light, and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf, chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use. The strobilurin-derived compound <b>azoxystrobin,</b> ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996, was designed to overcome these limitations. It is the world's biggest-selling fungicide. Other commercial fungicides developed from the strobilurins include Allegro, and Brio (kresoxim-methyl) Amistar.|$|E

5000|$|Dry bean is {{an ancient}} crop, first domesticated over 7000 years ago and is still a staple crop globally. Today, the largest bean {{producing}} nations are Brazil, India, China, Mexico, The United States of America, Myanmar, Canada, and Argentina. In all of these nations, anthracnose {{is considered one of}} the most invasive and destructive dry bean diseases, capable of destroying up to 95% of a plantation's yield while also threatening growth and development rates. As such, it is very important for producers to have disease-free certified seeds, which are generally produced in arid regions such as Idaho, where the relative humidity does not surpass the necessary 92% for spore germination. Further precaution is often taken by producers, who apply fungicides such as <b>Azoxystrobin,</b> fluodiooxonil or metalaxyl-m. Applied at a concentration of 125 grams per hectare of dry bean crop, <b>azoxystrobin</b> has been shown to increase bean yields by up to 20%.|$|E
50|$|Early {{symptoms}} of garlic rust are small yellow {{spots on the}} leaves that soon expand until the leaf tissue shatters and visible pustules emerge. Diseased bulbs lose their protective dry outer skin, preventing photosynthesis and leaving the garlic prone to shattering when mechanically harvested. In trials tebconazole and <b>azoxystrobin</b> {{have been shown to}} provide 50% higher yields in treated crops.|$|E
50|$|In fungi, {{the ability}} of the {{alternative}} oxidase to bypass inhibition of parts of the electron transport chain can contribute to fungicide resistance. This is seen in the strobilurin fungicides that target complex III, such as <b>azoxystrobin,</b> picoxystrobin and fluoxastrobin. However, as the alternative pathway generates less ATP, these fungicides are still effective in preventing spore germination, as this is an energy-intensive process.|$|E
50|$|Under normal {{conditions}} in Hawaii {{it is estimated}} that without control of black sigatoka yield losses would be 30%. Sigatoka is controlled with a combination of protectant and systemic fungicides in order to prevent resistance from developing. Mancozeb is applied as the primary protectant and fenbuconazole, tebuconazole, and <b>azoxystrobin</b> are applied as systemic fungicides. These fungicides are applied during summer.|$|E
50|$|Leaf blight {{occurs in}} areas with hot and humid weather. The spores land on onion leaves, {{penetrate}} the skin, and rapidly kill the leaf. This causes a severe reduction in bulb size, as high as 50%, and can happen {{in less than a}} week. Applications of foliar fungicides can be used to control leaf blight. These include <b>azoxystrobin,</b> chlorotholonil copper, mancozeb, maneb, and mefenoxam.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew left {{uncontrolled}} has {{the ability}} to reduce yields by up to 55% and infest up to 80% of plants. Downy mildew is primarily controlled through the use of several fungicides applied during midseason. The fungicides used include <b>azoxystrobin,</b> copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and maneb. Farmers in Florida who regularly use fungicides have been shown to reduce yield losses due to downy mildew to as low as 2%.|$|E
50|$|Trimethyl orthoformate is {{a useful}} {{building}} block for creating methoxymethylene groups and heterocyclic ring systems.

50|$|Alternaria {{leaf spot}} affects the cabbage plant by causing severe {{spotting}} and discoloration {{to the head}} of the plant. It is only a superficial effect to the plant but because of the black color of the leaf spots the marketability of a severely infected cabbage crop is low. Without control leaf spot is estimated to be able to reduce yields by up to 50%. Alternaria leaf spot is controlled using the same treatment as downy mildew: applications of <b>azoxystrobin,</b> copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and maneb beginning midseason.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew is an {{extremely}} fast-developing disease in the onion. Studies have observed up to 40% of a field being infected {{in less than three}} days. The first symptoms of the disease are white and purple growths {{on the surface of the}} plant leaves. Eventually these leaves die. This in turn destroys the plant's photosynthetic abilities, stunting growth and sometimes killing the plant. Untreated downy mildew can reduce yields by 65%. Downy mildew is controlled with the same foliar fungicides as leaf blight: <b>azoxystrobin,</b> copper, mancozeb, maneb, and mefenoxam.|$|E
50|$|When {{spraying}} fungicides Quilt and Headline EC at 6 oz/a at tassel stage using a tractor-mounted CO2 powered sprayer using 20 {{gallons of}} water/acre, average yield {{was seen to}} increase. The use of fungicides can be both economically and environmentally costly and should only be applied on susceptible varieties and large-scale corn production. In order to prevent fungal resistance to fungicides, all fungicides are to be used alternatively, switching fungicides with different modes of action. Pyraclostrobin (Headline EC) and <b>azoxystrobin</b> are Quinone outside Inhibitor (QoI) fungicides, whereas propiconazole and prothioconazole are DeMethylation Inhibitors (DMI) fungicides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azoxystrobin</b> was {{discovered}} during research on Oudemansiella mucida and Strobilurus tenacellus, which are small white or brown coloured mushrooms {{commonly found in}} European forests. Not bigger than a few centimeters, these mushrooms attracted attention of scientists because of their remarkable ability to defend themselves. Their defense mechanism {{is based on the}} secretion of two substances, strobilurin A and oudemansin A. These substances allow them to keep their competitors at a distance and kill them when in range. Observations of this mechanism led to research that resulted in the development of azoxystrobin.The molecule was synthetised for the first time by Dr. Christopher Godfrey at Jealott's Hill International Research Centre in Bracknell (UK).|$|E
50|$|In California, {{since its}} discovery, panicle and shoot blight have become major {{diseases}} of the pistachio crop. The warm, wet weather in the California pistachio acreage {{has proven to be}} optimal for the disease. In 1998 alone total lost production was estimated to be around 20 million pounds. The only areas that have been found resilient to the disease are Kern County and parts of the San Joaquin valley. Symptoms include dark lesions and shoots from the buds that are stunted and black. Eventually the leaves on the shoots wither and die and the fruit clusters subsequently collapse. Currently <b>azoxystrobin</b> and chlorothalonil are used for blight control.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of treated seed, there are {{multiple}} chemical sprays available to treat Alternaria dauci. <b>Azoxystrobin,</b> chlorothalonil, iprodione, pyraclostrobin and bacillus are a few common fungicides to consider for foliar application. A few brand names {{to look for in}} the Midwest include RR Endura 70WG, Rovral, and Switch. Gibberrillic acid has shown to be equally effective as the aforementioned fungicides. However, if sprayed in excess giberrillic acid can defer nutrients from the roots to foliage, resulting in undeveloped carrots. If chemically treating plants, scouting the crop is of utmost importance. Initial threshold recommendations vary depending on location, time of year, and moisture level. Different recommendations include spraying upon first evidence of symptoms or spraying once disease has reached 25% of the foliage ...|$|E
50|$|Pythium and Rhizoctonia {{are both}} {{seedling}} {{diseases of the}} cotton plant. They can be devastating to cotton plants because they develop when seedlings are unable to overcome the damage being caused by the invading fungus. The diseases often kill seeds before they grow. However, if the seeds do manage to sprout they demonstrate symptoms almost immediately. The stalks of the cotton plant will be weak, brown sunken lesions {{will appear on the}} stem, and the plant will often die before producing or will have very poor yields. Growers who plant early are especially susceptible because cooler temperatures and damper weather are conducive to these diseases. Therefore, growers who plant early are advised to use in-furrow fungicides for control: PNCB and iprodione for Rhizoctonia and etridiazole and mefenoxam for pythium. Recently, <b>azoxystrobin</b> has proven effective in controlling both rhizoctonia and pythium.|$|E
