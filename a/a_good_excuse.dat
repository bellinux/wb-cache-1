Within each couplet, a rising musical figure presents the [...] "problem" [...] ("Why are you still crying?"), while the second line consists of a [...] "falling melodic consolation" [...] ("Your pain is now through"). In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison offers little comment about [...] "Behind That Locked Door", aside from identifying the inspiration behind the song and admitting: [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>excuse</b> to do a country tune with pedal steel guitar." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He highlighted the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli, saying that he [...] "totally owns every scene he’s in". He thought that the situation which left La Forge in charge of the Enterprise was [...] "horribly contrived" [...] and said [...] "Picard doesn’t even give <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>excuse</b> for going down to the planet beyond the script calling for it". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten, summing up that it was a [...] "fun, enjoyable, diverting episode". Zack Handlen reviewed the episode in May 2010 for The A.V. Club. He criticised the episode, saying that there [...] "are all kinds of problems, the biggest being that the episode doesn't really have a third act, but the moral superiority of the crew is on full display, and it's frustrating." [...] He summed up the moral story played out in this episode, saying that [...] "On TOS, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy would've hashed out the appeal of an unbeatable weapon as well as its drawbacks. Here, we're all supposed to know that violence begets violence, and that's it." [...] He gave the episode a grade of C+.|$|E

[...] Considering that Josephine reported in later life at having first arrived with the Markham Troupe on December 1, 1879, and that Josephine joined Behan in Tombstone that same year, her reference to [...] "my bad experience of a few years ago" [...] means she must have been in Arizona for some time before 1879.|$|E

2500|$|Goldman depicts Paul McCartney in an {{extremely}} positive light, as being the only true talent among the Beatles, {{and the man who}} made the band able to function. [...] On January 16, 1980, customs officials in Japan found 7.7 ounces (218.3 g) of cannabis in McCartney's luggage as he and the other musicians in Wings tried to enter the country for a concert tour. Rather than lay the blame for this incident on McCartney, Albert Goldman asserts that it was orchestrated by Yoko Ono. She supposedly had advance notice that her husband's friend would be smuggling drugs into her homeland. [...] She allegedly made overseas telephone calls to government officials she knew with the hope that he would be arrested, thereby giving her <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>excuse</b> to forbid her husband from communicating with his friend.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking, {{primarily}} of tobacco, is {{an activity that}} is practiced by some 1.1billion people, and up to 1/3 of the adult population. The image of the smoker can vary considerably, but is very often associated, especially in fiction, with individuality and aloofness. Even so, smoking of both tobacco and cannabis can be a social activity {{which serves as a}} reinforcement of social structures and is part of the cultural rituals of many and diverse social and ethnic groups. Many smokers begin smoking in social settings and the offering and sharing of a cigarette is often an important rite of initiation or simply <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>excuse</b> to start a conversation with strangers in many settings; in bars, night clubs, at work or on the street. Lighting a cigarette is often seen as an effective way of avoiding the appearance of idleness or mere loitering. For adolescents, it can function as a first step out of childhood or as an act of rebellion against the adult world. Also, smoking {{can be seen as a}} sort of camaraderie. It has been shown that even opening a packet of cigarettes, or offering a cigarette to other people, can increase the level of dopamine (the [...] "happy feeling") in the brain, and it is doubtless that people who smoke form relationships with fellow smokers, in a way that only proliferates the habit, particularly in countries where smoking inside public places has been made illegal. Other than recreational drug use, it can be used to construct identity and a development of self-image by associating it with personal experiences connected with smoking. The rise of the modern anti-smoking movement in the late 19th century did more than create awareness of the hazards of smoking; it provoked reactions of smokers against what was, and often still is, perceived as an assault on personal freedom and has created an identity among smokers as rebels or outcasts, apart from non-smokers: ...|$|E

I should have liked nothing better than <b>a</b> reasonably <b>good</b> <b>excuse</b> to punch his head; yet, paradoxically, I was ashamed of myself for harboring him any ill will.

5000|$|Russell is {{generally}} credited with {{being one of}} the founders of analytic philosophy. He was deeply impressed by Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics. He was particularly prolific in the field of metaphysics, the logic and the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of language, ethics and epistemology. When Brand Blanshard asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, [...] "but that is not <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>excuse,</b> for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects".|$|R
50|$|It was Eleanor of Provence who {{arranged}} a marriage between her sister Sanchia and her brother-in-law Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, whose first wife Isabel Marshal had died recently. At the time, Sanchia {{was engaged to}} Raymond VII of Toulouse, but the weak part {{he played in the}} recent fighting was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> enough <b>excuse</b> for breaking the bond. Eleanor and Sanchia's uncle Peter was sent to negotiate the marriage contract in 1242. Another uncle, Philip, escorted Sanchia safely to the English court in Gascony. There, they joined Eleanor and Henry, and met their new daughter Beatrice. The wedding took place at Westminster on November 23.|$|R

40|$|Ignorance {{is often}} <b>a</b> {{perfectly}} <b>good</b> <b>excuse.</b> There are interesting debates about whether non-culpable factual ignorance and mistake subvert obligation, but little disagreement about whether non-culpable factual ignorance and mistake exculpate. What about agents who {{have all the}} relevant facts in view but fail to meet their obligations {{because they do not}} have the right moral beliefs? If their ignorance of their obligations derives from mistaken moral beliefs or from ignorance of the moral significance of the facts they have in view, should they be excused for failing to meet their moral obligations? It is not obvious that they should. In this paper we argue that the best non-skeptical accounts of moral responsibility acknowledge that factual ignorance and mistake will diminish moral responsibility in a way that moral ignorance and mistake will not. That is because factual ignorance is often non-culpable so long as it meets certain merely procedural epistemic standards but the same is not true of moral ignorance. Our argument is that the assumption that it is gets the standards of culpability for moral ignorance wrong, and that the mistake is encouraged by the thought that culpability in general requires an instance of known wrongdoing: that acting wrongly requires de dicto unresponsiveness to one’s obligations at some stage. We deny this and conclude that, therefore, ignorance and mistaken belief are indeed often perfectly <b>good</b> <b>excuses</b> – but far less often than some philosophers claim...|$|R
5000|$|On May 19, 1993, the The Times of Northwest Indiana {{ran a story}} {{entitled}} Baptism by innuendo, which criticized WJBK-TV's reporting. The Times wrote, [...] "If {{one were}} to take the insinuations of Detroit television station WJBK-TV seriously, one could {{get the impression that}} the First Baptist Church of Hammond is a sex-crime factory and that its pastors school in Hammond and the affiliated Hyles Anderson College in Schererville are institutions where people minor in molestation." [...] The Times also suggested that the May ratings period, which is traditionally known for such similar sensationalized stories, was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> enough <b>excuse</b> {{to make up for the}} poor journalism the stories displayed, concluding that the stories were [...] "a monstrous overreach". The Times went on to say: [...] "There is no large institution of any kind where some wrongdoers cannot be found. First Baptist and its affiliated institutions are no exception. To tar an entire congregation or student body and alumni with indiscriminate innuendo is highly irresponsible." ...|$|R

60|$|There {{would be}} county gatherings to attend, {{and he would}} {{naturally}} be expected to hunt and to shoot. It had all seemed to him inexpressedly dreary. Now all that was, if Brander's fears were realized, at an end, even if it should not {{turn out to be}} as bad as that, the sum he would be called upon to pay might be sufficient to cripple the estate and to afford him <b>a</b> <b>good</b> and legitimate <b>excuse</b> for shutting up or letting the house, and going away to retrench until the liabilities were all cleared off. Of course he would have to work in earnest now, but even the thought of that was not altogether unpleasant.|$|R
60|$|Another motive induces {{me to put}} the {{personal}} consideration of Lord Bute wholly out of the question. He communicates very little in a direct manner with {{the greater part of}} our men of business. This has never been his custom. It is enough for him that he surrounds them with his creatures. Several imagine, therefore, that they have <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>excuse</b> for doing all the work of this faction, when they have no personal connection with Lord Bute. But whoever becomes a party to an Administration, composed of insulated individuals, without faith plighted, tie, or common principle; an Administration constitutionally impotent, because supported by no party in the nation; he who contributes to destroy the connections of men and their trust in one another, or in any sort to throw the dependence of public counsels upon private will and favour, possibly may {{have nothing to do with}} the Earl of Bute. It matters little whether he be the friend or the enemy of that particular person. But let him be who or what he will, he abets a faction that is driving hard to the ruin of his country. He is sapping the foundation of its liberty, disturbing the sources of its domestic tranquillity, weakening its government over its dependencies, degrading it from all its importance in the system of Europe.|$|R
60|$|It {{began with}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many <b>excuses</b> {{for not having}} written before, and went on with a pretty {{expression}} of interest in Alice's letters and gratitude for them; Mrs. Mavering assured the girl {{that she could not}} imagine what a pleasure they had been to her. She promised herself that they should be great friends, and she said that she looked forward eagerly to the time, now drawing near, when Dan should bring her home to them. She said she knew Alice would find it dull at the Falls except for him, but they would all do their best, and she would find the place very different from what she had seen it in the winter. Alice could make believe that she was there just for the summer, and Mrs. Mavering hoped that before the summer was gone she would be so sorry for a sick old woman that she would not even wish to go with it. This part of the letter, which gave Dan away so hopelessly, as he felt, was phrased so touchingly, that he looked up from it with moist eyes to the hard cold judgment in the eyes of Alice.|$|R

5000|$|Killa Season {{garnered}} {{a positive}} reception but music critics were mixed toward Cam's choices in production and lyrical content compared to Purple Haze. Peter Relic of Rolling Stone found {{criticism in the}} album's production and soul samples and Cam's insults towards Jay-Z but still found it entertaining with its wordplay, saying that [...] "Killa Season proves Cam'ron can still bring heady verbiage and heat, but it's doubtful Jay-Z is losing much sleep." [...] While also finding the production decent, Brian Sims of HipHopDX praised the album's skits and hooks and Cam's delivery for bringing light to creative imagery, saying that [...] "As an industry veteran, Cam deserves {{a lot of credit}} for not using his album to address petty squabbles or provide some pseudo-intellectual autobiography." [...] AllMusic editor David Jeffries said that the album was in need of a rewrite on some tracks but still found it enjoyable with memorable hooks and for showing a vulnerable side in Cam, concluding that [...] "Killa Season would have benefited from trimming and better planning, but those things are extremely rare in the world of Dipset. Taking that into account, the album is exceptional and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> enough <b>excuse</b> for two more years of mouthing off and starting trouble." ...|$|R

40|$|Research {{developments}} {{since the}} appearance of MacAndrew and Edgerton's landmark volume, Drunken Comportment (1969), are summarized. The challenge of moving beyond the book is to understand what lies behind cultural variations in drunken comportment. Four specific factors in variations in drunken comportment are discussed. (1) A common contrast is between "wet" societies, where drinking is banalized everyday, and "dry" societies, where alcohol is set apart as a special commodity. Problems with this contrast are discussed, {{and the need for}} cross-cultural studies comparing expectancies from intoxication. (2) There is a need to study variations in the definition of intoxication as a "time out" state. In some societies, intoxication is likened to possession by spirits; a rationalistic version of this can be found in Canadian court decisions viewing extreme intoxication as potentially "akin to automatism". (3) If bad behaviour is a foreseeable consequence of drinking, why do some societies nevertheless not hold the drinker responsible? In Anglo-American and similar societies, drunkenness has some excuse value, but it is not <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>excuse.</b> Compromises like this seem to be found also in other cultures. (4) Pseudointoxication is fairly widespread, and seems to mark social situations where alcohol has enhanced excuse value. It appears to be a stratagem of the weaker side across cultural boundaries, and of the young where age-grading favours older groups. Concerning the possibility of cultural changes in drunken comportment, it is argued that there are historical examples, but such a shift requires a substantial social change.
