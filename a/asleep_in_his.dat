5|$|In {{an attempt}} to get Chris into Morningwood Academy, Peter is forced by Carter Pewterschmidt to appear in a remake of the 1997 comedy film Liar Liar. After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bed for the night, and is suddenly attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of dollar bills into their socks, and quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, in which the Marine recruits take turns striking Private Pyle with bars of soap wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this {{due to the}} Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
5|$|A Joint RAN-USN Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the incident, and was in session over June and July 1969. The Board found Evans partially at fault for the collision, but also faulted Melbourne for not taking evasive action sooner, even though international sea regulations dictated that in the lead up to a collision, the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed. It was learned during the inquiry that Evans commanding officer was <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> quarters {{at the time of}} the incident, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch, while the latter was at sea for the first time. Subsequent to the inquiry, the three USN officers and Stevenson were court-martialled by their respective navies on charges of negligence, with the three USN officers found guilty and Stevenson 'Honourably Acquitted'. Despite the findings, Stevenson's next posting was as a minor flag officer's chief of staff, seen by him as a demotion in all but name. In a repeat of the aftermath of the Voyager collision, Melbournes captain resigned amid accusations of scapegoating. In December 2012, Stevenson announced that he had received a letter from the Minister for Defence, apologising for his treatment by the RAN and the government of the day.|$|E

A Sikh youth woke up {{discovering}} {{his hair}} was cut by 50 to 60cm while he was <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dormitory.

25|$|Unfortunately for Goram, he {{overheated}} while hard at work, drank a giant {{quantity of}} ale, and fell <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favourite (stone) chair, whilst Vincent paced himself better and completed his channel. (One version depicts Goram as lazy and Vincent as keen and industrious.) The geographical {{point is to}} explain the narrow gorge of the Hazel Brook (a tributary of the river Trym) in Henbury and the dramatic Avon Gorge through which the Avon now flows. The onomastic point is {{to account for the}} name of the Avon Gorge, but this is a bit feeble since the river has had this name from time immemorial.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{several of}} hide's {{friends and colleagues}} stated that they {{believed}} the auto-strangulation {{to have been an}} accident, among them X Japan co-founder Yoshiki and former X bassist Taiji. This notion is supported by the fact that no suicide note was left and Taiji theorizes in his autobiography, that at the night of his death, hide may have been practicing a technique to relieve upper back and neck pains which guitarists can suffer from continuous use of a shoulder strap. The technique involved was practiced by the X Japan members during their touring days and required the use of a towel and a door knob or handle. According to Taiji, hide may have fallen <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> intoxicated state, becoming caught and strangling himself.|$|E

50|$|An alternate, {{extended}} ending {{based on}} Barrie's epilogue is {{featured on the}} DVD, but with unfinished special effects and no music. In this version, Peter returns to the London house years later, finding an adult Wendy. He is deeply hurt when she tells him she has grown up, {{and walks over to}} her own daughter, <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> bed. <b>His</b> sobbing awakes the little girl, and she introduces herself as Jane. Peter grins excitedly at Wendy, and with her mother's permission, Jane flies away with Peter to Neverland as Wendy watches them through the window.|$|R
25|$|On August 12, 1914, Baron Gautsch sailed from Kotor to Trieste for {{the last}} time. The {{commander}} was Captain Paul Winter. On August 13, 1914, at 11:00 am, Baron Gautsch departed from harbour {{on the island of}} Veli Lošinj, and was sailing directly to the port of Trieste, where it was scheduled to arrive at 6.00 pm. From Veli Lošinj to Pula, the ship was officially sailing under the command of First Officer Josef Luppis, but {{this was not the case}} in reality. In fact, Luppis was handed over command by the captain in 2:00 pm, but he left the bridge, without Captain's knowledge, handing command to the relatively inexperienced second officer Tenze, and went to lunch with the first class passengers. Captain Winter was <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cabin.|$|E

As he retrieves the gun from the glove box, he discovers an envelope containing the results of Vera's pregnancy test and a letter written by Vera on the back. The film cuts to a flashback of the time Robert came to Alex's home while he was away. It is revealed that the day before, Vera attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on pills but is saved by Robert. The next day, Vera finds out she is pregnant and confides with Robert, revealing that she never had an affair and that the baby was in fact Alex's, even though she says it felt like it wasn't his as they hardly ever talk. She expressed concerns about having another baby in this relationship that was lacking communication.|$|E
25|$|According to the texts, a {{merchant}} 500 yearsa ago named Manga Oswal from Nagarparkar {{had gone to}} Pattan to purchase some items. He was informed in a dream that an image was buried under {{the house of a}} local Muslim that Oswal was instructed to acquire. Oswal bought the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka), and was instructed in another dream to place the image on a cart and to move forward without looking back. The cart is said to have broken down near Nagarparkar, where Oswal then fell <b>asleep.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> next dream, he was informed that underneath him lay marble and treasure, and instructed him to recruit craftsmen to build a fine temple in which to worship the idol, which was bestowed with the name Gori. The temple's construction was supervised by an architect from Sirohi, while the shikhar of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The image was formally reconsecrated by Acharya Merutunga Suri of Anchala Gachchha, thus establishing the Gori Parshvanth Tirth, and the temple as a place of pilgrimage for Jains from afar.|$|E

500|$|The Pi Chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon ("Deke") {{was founded}} in 1853. [...] It was the fourth social {{fraternity}} at Dartmouth College. Eight brothers of Delta Kappa Epsilon were famously involved in a 1949 murder of a fellow Dartmouth student.

500|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1912.

Another recurring subject is that of the children whether playing on the beach or <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the sun. <b>His</b> travelling led to paintings of Orientalist subjects such as some Arabian portraits or Tangier beach scenes.|$|R

So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be."
