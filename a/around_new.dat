5|$|By 1900, {{the burgeoning}} {{industrial}} town had 4,600 residents {{and two years}} later Reverend Bonaventure Piscopo, a member of the Apostolic Band for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, formed a new congregation in New Kensington to serve the immigrant work force, many of whom were Italian Catholics. The church was named after Saint Peter, the first pope. The parishioners of this new congregation were Italians living in and <b>around</b> <b>New</b> Kensington, Arnold, and Parnassus, which later became a part of the city of New Kensington. These immigrants needed a place to worship and in 1903, the St. Peter congregation began holding Mass with a resident pastor, Reverend Vincenzo Maselli in a small building on the corner of Second Avenue and Tenth Street (known as the downtown area) in New Kensington.|$|E

5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations <b>around</b> <b>New</b> Guinea.

5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} <b>around</b> <b>New</b> Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence. These {{have increased the}} threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} <b>around</b> <b>New</b> Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E
5|$|Route172 {{originated}} as {{alignment of}} State Highway Route S-28, which was assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering.

However, {{just a few}} years after the designation of NJ 18 in New Brunswick along George Street, construction of a bypass <b>around</b> <b>New</b> Brunswick began. The highway was constructed along Burnet Street, which became state-maintained by the State Highway Department. The route was completed to Route27, and Route18 was moved onto that alignment. The former alignment of Route18 remained state-maintained up to the intersection with Commercial Avenue, which was eventually re-designated as Route172.|$|E
