5|$|Rome's {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} Europe <b>and</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean, and its development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era, {{with an estimated}} annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes.

5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back <b>and</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E

On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E

5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader {{did not bother}} to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently. On his way back to Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe <b>and</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{unification}} of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, elevated lines were being shut down {{all over the city}} and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue Elevated, serving the Upper East Side and East Harlem, closed on June 11, 1940; the southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown <b>and</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Queensborough Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue elevated caused overcrowding on the Astoria and Flushing Lines in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan's far East Side. Because of the elevated line's closure, as well as a corresponding increase in the East Side's population, the need for a Second Avenue subway increased.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police who had controlled the Sinai Desert were withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. After the Gallipoli Campaign, a second joint German and Ottoman force again advanced across the desert to threaten the canal, during July 1916. This force was defeated in August at the Battle of Romani, after which the Anzac Mounted Division, also known as the A. & N. Z. Mounted Division, under the command of the Australian major general Harry Chauvel, pushed the Ottoman Army's Desert Force commanded by the German general Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein out of Bir el Abd <b>and</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Sinai to El Arish.|$|E
