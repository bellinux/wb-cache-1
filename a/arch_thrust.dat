30|$|The static of masonry arches, when {{a finite}} {{displacement}} at the springing occurs, is {{examined in this}} paper. This problem is worthy of interest since small displacements of the supports in the existing masonry arches and vaults can take place due to different causes, including the subsidence of foundation system, viscous phenomena affecting the mortars, and movements of underlying structures. Consequently, the structure can reach a condition of collapse because of gradual changes in its geometry. A typical example is represented by arch or vault supported on piers. In this case, if displacements of the supports arise, the span increases, the rise decreases, and a growth of the <b>arch</b> <b>thrust</b> occurs, giving rise to a further movement of the springing, up to the failure condition.|$|E

30|$|When {{the height}} of the piers (H) ranges between 3 and 6  m, a point of equilibrium, shown with a red circle, is found as {{intersection}} between the shear–displacement curve of the pier and the thrust–displacement curve of the arch. When H is higher than six, the two curves do not intersect, and no equilibrium condition exists. In this case, two collapse modes can be achieved. In particular, if the <b>arch</b> collapse <b>thrust</b> (highlighted by the black cross in Fig.  21) is lower than the maximum load bearable by the piers (represented with the dashed line), the arch governs the failure of the system. This situation takes place, in our case, for heights equal to 7, 8, and 9  m (Fig.  21). On the contrary, the collapse is due to the piers when their maximum load is smaller than the <b>arch</b> collapse <b>thrust</b> (H =  10, Fig.  21).|$|R
40|$|Plate-bandes are {{straight}} masonry arches (they are called, also, flat arches or lintel arches). Ideally {{they have the}} surfaces of extrados and intrados plane and horizontal. The stones or bricks have radial joints converging usually in one centre. The voussoirs have the form of wedges and in French they are called "claveaux". A plate-bande is, in fact, a lintel made of several stones and the proportions of lintels and plate-bandes are similar. Proportions of plate-bandes, that {{is the relationship between}} the thickness t and the span s (t/s) varies, typically between 1 / 4 – 1 / 3 in thick plate-bandes, and is less than 1 / 20 in the most slender ones. A ratio of circa 1 / 8 was usual in the 18 th Century and follows a simple geometrical rule: the centre form with the intrados an equilateral triangle and the plate-bande should contain an arc of circle. The joints are usually plane, but in some cases present a «rebated» or «stepped» form. 	Plate-bandes exert an inclined thrust as any masonry arch. This thrust is usually very high and it requires either massive buttresses, or to be built in the middle of thick walls. Master builders and architects have tried since antiquity to calculate the abutment necessary for any arch. A modern architect or engineer will measure the <b>arch</b> <b>thrust</b> in units of force, kN or tons. Traditionally, the thrust has been measured as the size of the buttresses to resist it safely. Old structural rules, then, addressed the design problem establishing a relationship between the span and the depth of the buttress. These were empirical rules, particular for every type of arch or structure in every epoch. Thus, the typical gothic buttress is 1 / 4 of the vault span, but a Renaissance or baroque barrel vault will need more than 1 / 3 of the span. A plate-bande would require more than one half of the span; this is precisely the rule cited by the French engineer Gautier, who tried unsuccessfully to justify it by static reasons. They were used, typically, to form the lintels of windows or doors (1 - 2 m, typically); in Antiquity they were used, also, though rarely, at the gates of city walls or in niches (ca. 2 m, reaching 5. 2 m). 	Plate-bandes may show particular problems: it is not unusual that some sliding of the voussoirs can be observed, particularly in thick plate-bandes. The stepped joints on Fig. 1, left, were used to avoid this problem. There are other «hidden» methods, like iron cramps or the use of stone wedges, etc. In seismic zones these devices were usual. Another problem relates to the deformation; a slight yielding of the abutments, or even the compression of the mortar joints, may lead to some cracking and the descent of the central keystone. Even a tiny descent will convert the original straight line of the intrados in a broken line with a visible «kink» or angle in the middle. Of course, both problems should be avoided. Finally, the wedge form of the voussoirs lead to acute angles in the stones and this can produce partial fractures; this occurs usually at the inferior border of the springers at the abutments. 	It follows, that to build a successful plate-bande is not an easy matter. Also, the structural study of plate-bandes is far from simple, and mechanics and geometry are related in a particular way. In the present paper we will concentrate on the structural aspects and their constructive consequences, with a historical approach. We will outline the development of structural analysis of plate-bandes from ca. 1700 until today. This brief history has a more than purely academic interest. Different approaches and theories pointed to particular problem, and though the solution given may have been incorrect, the question posed was often pertinent. The paper ends with the application of modern Limit Analysis of Masonry Structures, developed mainly by professor Heyman in the last fifty years. The work aims, also, to give some clues for the actual architect and engineer involved in the analysis or restoration of masonry buildings...|$|E

The priority of the Byzantines in its use is also evidenced by slightly pointed examples in Sant'Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna, and the Hagia Irene, Constantinople. The pointed arch was subsequently adopted and widely used by Muslim architects, becoming the characteristic arch of Islamic architecture. According to Bony, it has spread from Islamic lands, possibly through Sicily, then under Islamic rule, {{and from there to}} Amalfi in Italy, {{before the end of the}} 11th century.

40|$|TIlls {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} collapse of masonry structures in response to large support displacements and horizontal ground accelerations. There are two main classes of masonry structure: <b>arches</b> that <b>thrust,</b> and supporting elements, such as walls and buttresses, which resist the thrust. This dissertation analyses the safety of arches and buttresses and identifies the resulting collapse mechanisms due to support displacements or horizontal accelerations. In patiicular, this resesarch investigates the stability of a masonry arch supported on buttresses and the conditions necessary for collapse to occur. Engineers are frequently asked to determine the safety of masonry structures that have been severely distorted over the years, often due to subsidence or other long-term movements in the foundations, and this disseliation provides guidance {{in the assessment of}} such structures. The resistance of masonry buttresses to high-level horizontal loads is examined. In the case of failure due to overturning, a fracture will develop in the masonry, significantly reducing the resistance of the buttress. The capacity is further reduced by outward leaning of the buttresses, a common source of distress for masonry structures due to movements in the supporting foundations. Based on these considerations, new measures of safety are proposed for buttresses under horizontal loading. Outward leaning of the buttresses increases the span of the arch or vault. Spreading supports will cause large deformations in the arch, which increase the horizontal <b>thrust</b> of the <b>arch</b> and may lead to collapse. In addition, lateral ground accelerations can cause {{the collapse of}} arches. The influence of seismic action can be approximated to first order by equivalent static analysis to determine the initial collapse mechanism. These problems are analysed for circular masonry arches, and the collapse conditions are identified for various geometries. The findings are combined to investigate the stability of the masonry arch supported on buttresses. The safety of the system is examined by studying the influence of imposed displacements. As the buttresses lean, the thrust of the vault increases and the resistance of the buttress decreases. The collapse mechanisms are identified for both the static case of leaning buttresses and the dynamic case of horizontal acceleration. This analysis illustrates that the arch will collapse and the buttresses will remain standing in most cases. Based on these considerations, new methods are proposed for assessing the safety of masonry structures and determining the influence of future movements on the stability of existing masonry structures.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{application}} of ground penetrating radar (GPR) as a non-destructive technique for the monitoring of ring separation in brick masonry arch bridges. In addition, research is reported on {{the assessment of the}} clay capping layer often used in construction as a waterproof backing to <b>arches.</b> The <b>thrust</b> of the research is numerical modelling, verified by large laboratory experiments. Due to the heterogeneity of these structures, the resultant signals from the interaction between the GPR system and the bridge are often complex and hence, hard to interpret. This highlighted the need to create a GPR numerical model that would allow the study of the attributes of reflected signals from various targets within the structure of the bridge. The GPR numerical analysis was undertaken using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Since micro regions in the bridge structure need to be modelled, the introduction of subgrids of supporting finer spatial resolution into the standard FDTD method was considered essential in order to economise on the required computational resources. In the main part of this thesis, it is demonstrated how realistic numerical modelling of GPR using the FDTD method could greatly benefit from the implementation of subgrids into the conventional FDTD mesh. This is particularly important when (a) parts of the computational domain need to be modelled in detail (i. e., ring separation between the mortar layers and the brick units, which is the case studied in this thesis); and also (b) when there are features or regions in the overall computational mesh with values of high relative permittivity supporting propagation of waves at very short wavelengths. A scheme is presented that simplifies the process of implementing these subgrids into the traditional FDTD method. This scheme is based on the combination of the standard FDTD method and the unconditionally stable alternating-direction implicit (ADI) FDTD technique. Given that ADI-FDTD is unconditionally stable, its time-step can be set to any value that facilitates the accurate calculation of the electromagnetic fields. By doing so, the two grids can efficiently communicate information across their boundary without requiring to use a time-interpolation scheme. The performance of ADI-FDTD subgrids when implemented into the traditional FDTD method is discussed herein. The developed algorithm can handle cases where the subgrid crosses dielectrically inhomogeneous and/or conductive media. In addition, results from the comparison between the proposed scheme and a commonly employed purely FDTD subgridding technique are presented. After determination of the optimum ADI-FDTD scheme, numerical experiments were conducted and calibrated using GPR laboratory experiments. Good correlations were obtained between the numerical experiments and the actual GPR experiments. It was shown both numerically and experimentally that significant mortar loss between the masonry arch rings can be detected. Dry hairline delaminations between the mortar and the brick masonry are difficult to detect using standard GPR procedures. However, hairline faults containing water produce distinct and detectable GPR responses. In addition, the clay layer was successfully identified and its thickness calculated to a satisfactory accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In mid-April, 1983, an old {{landslide}} near Thistle, Utah, {{began to}} move, and within days had blocked Spanish Fork Canyon. As the slide 2 ̆ 7 s movement continued, construction crews gradually converted {{the toe of}} the slide into an earth-filled dam [...] Thistle dam [...] that impounded northwest-flowing Spanish Fork River. The resultant reservoir, known as Thistle Lake, was subsequently drained because of uncertainty about {{the stability of the}} dam. Recently, officials of Utah County have explored various alternatives for a water-retention structure in the area, including utilization of Thistle dam. The Thistle Slide Committee, established by the State of Utah to evaluate the suitability of using Thistle dam, suggests that construction of a new dam upstream from the present one might be a more reasonable and cheaper solution than investigating the stability of the present dam. Two potential geologic hazards that could impact a dam site upstream from the Thistle dam, however, may be in the area: the Thistle Canyon fault and the Thistle Creek diapiric fold. Uncertainty shrouds the existence of both. The Thistle Canyon fault is a postulated high-angle normal fault that trends about N. 20 degrees E. through Thistle. The fault, downthrown on the east, separates an erosional escarpment formed on the Charleston-Nebo thrust plate from younger overlying Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary rocks. The Thistle Creek diapiric fold theoretically trends about N. 30 degrees E. through the area. Tenuous evidence suggests that the Arapien Shale, an evaporite-rich intrusive sedimentary unit that forms the core of the fold, was overridden by the upper plate of the Charleston-Nebo thrust fault. Since then, the Arapien has welled upward, <b>arching</b> both the <b>thrust</b> plate and the overlying younger sedimentary cover. Additional field investigations should be completed to determine the existence of these hazards prior to any final decision about a new dam. The presence of either or both of these hazards, however, does not necessarily preclude the construction of a safe and stable dam that would impound a multi-purpose reservoir...|$|R
2500|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{outlines}} of the solution of the problem. If a hemispherical dome is cut by four vertical planes, the intersection gives four semicircular arches; if cut in addition by a horizontal plane tangent {{to the top of the}}se arches, it describes a circle; that portion of the sphere which is below this circle and between the arches, forming a spherical spandril, is the pendentive, and its radius is equal to the diagonal of the square on which the four arches rest. Having obtained a circle for the base of the dome, it is not necessary that the upper portion of the dome should spring from the same level as the arches, or that its domical surface should be a continuation of that of the pendentive. The first and second dome of the Hagia Sophia apparently fell down, so that Justinian determined to raise it, possibly to give greater lightness to the structure, but mainly in order to obtain increased light for the interior of the church. This was effected by piercing it with forty windows - the effect of which, as the light streaming through these windows, gave the dome the appearance of being suspended in the air. The pendentive which carried the dome rested on four great <b>arches,</b> the <b>thrust</b> of those crossing the church being counteracted by immense buttresses which traversed the aisles, and the other two partly by smaller arches in the apse, the thrust being carried to the outer walls, and to a certain extent by the side walls which were built under the arches. From the description given by Procopius we gather that the centering employed for the great arches consisted of a wall erected to support them during their erection. The construction of the pendentives is not known, but it is surmised that to the top of the pendentives they were built in horizontal courses of brick, projecting one over the other, the projecting angles being cut off afterwards and covered with stucco in which the mosaics were embedded; this was the method employed in the erection of the Périgordian domes, to which we shall return; these, however, were of less diameter than those of the Hagia Sophia, being only about 40 to [...] instead of [...] The apotheosis of Byzantine architecture, in fact, was reached in Hagia Sophia, for although it formed the model on which all subsequent Byzantine churches were based, so far as their plan was concerned, no domes approaching the former in dimensions were even attempted. The principal difference in some later examples is that which took place in the form of the pendentive on which the dome was carried. Instead of the spherical spandril of Hagia Sophia, large niches were formed in the angles, as in the Mosque of Damascus, which was built by Byzantine workmen for the Al-Walid I in A.D. 705; these gave an octagonal base on which the hemispherical dome rested; or again, as in the Sassanian palaces of Sarvestan and Firouzabad of the 4th and 5th century, when a series of concentric arch rings, projecting one in front of the other, were built, giving also an octagonal base; each of these pendentives is known as a squinch.|$|R
40|$|Vein, {{fracture}} and disseminated Au-As-Sb mineralisation at Brewery Creek is principally {{hosted by}} Tombstone Plutonic Suite (TPS) monzonite sills that have intruded Palaeozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Selwyn Basin and the Earn Group. The overall {{architecture of the}} property {{is that of a}} broad NNE trending <b>arch</b> of <b>thrust</b> sheets, with the rocks in each thrust sheet deformed into upright to steeply inclined, open to tight, variably NE, E, NW trending and plunging folds. Middle Cretaceous intrusive rocks including monzonite, syenite and hornblende gabbro cut the thrust faults and folds. The monzonite intrusive rocks crop out through the centre of the Brewery Creek property as a series of elongate, E oriented sills that have been subsequently deformed by numerous, variably oriented normal faults The paragenetic history of Brewery Creek can be resolved into three main stages: pre-, syn- and post- TPS intrusion. The pre-TPS intrusion stage encompasses sedimentary rock hosted disseminated and massive pyrite, carbonate veins and breccia infill, quartz veins, and stylolites. The TPS intrusion stage comprises the emplacement of TPS intrusions and the development of their contact aureoles and the post-TPS intrusion includes pyrite ± quartz ± carbonate ± roscoelite veins, quartz only veins, gold bearing arsenopyrite-quartz-carbonate veins, several stages of brecciation and stibnite ± quartz ± carbonate ± kaolinite veins. Gold assay analysis and vein measurements from the open pits along the Reserve Trend highlight two distinct mineralised orientations, E and NE. These orientations are paralleled by numerous metre-scale, steeply dipping post-TPS faults and mineralisation is bound at depth by a moderately dipping, E-striking normal fault, termed the Basal Fault. The observed normal displacement, which is evident on all of the post-TPS faults, combined with steeply dipping E-trending gold bearing veins is best explained by mineralisation occurring during a period of local extension. Gold mineralisation at Brewery Creek is characterised by an Au-As-Sb ± Ag, Pb geochemical signature with elevated As (> 1000 ppm) being the best indicator of Au > 1 ppm. High concentrations of Sb in intrusive rocks and elevated levels of Ag and Sb in sedimentary rocks provide further indication of Au. Alteration is characterised by enrichment of CO 2, K 2 O, MnO, and SO 3 and depletion of Na 2 O. This element mobility can be directly correlated to pervasive carbonate, pyrite and arsenopyrite alteration of feldspar and biotite in monzonite sills. CaO and Fe 2 O 3 are comparatively immobile, which suggests that the Ca and Fe required to form calcite and pyrite respectively was sourced from destruction of feldspars and biotite. The highest Au concentrations at Brewery Creek are hosted by arsenopyrite crystals with lower but significant levels of Au also found in arsenopyrite overgrowths on pyrite and pyrite overgrown by arsenopyrite. Gold is preferentially distributed into arsenopyrite and pyrite phases hosted by carbonate and clay altered wall rock. Veinhosted sulphide minerals are volumetrically minor and contain lower concentrations of gold. Hydrothermal fluids associated with mineralisation were reduced, CO 2 rich and near neutral in pH. Gold was likely to have been transported as a bisulphide complex and the predominance of Au-bearing wall rock arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite emphasise the importance of sulphidation reactions as a Au precipitation mechanism. Isotope data provide evidence for significant input of magmatic fluids into the mineralising system at Brewery Creek. The calculated fluid compositions are consistent with an initial mixed magmatic and crustal (sedimentary) source that is replaced over time by a mixed magmatic and evolved meteoric fluid source. A genetic model for mineralisation is described that is based on emplacement of felsic magma and subsequent cooling of the associated hydrothermal system...|$|R
