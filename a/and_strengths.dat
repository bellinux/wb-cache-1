Roosevelt issued a public {{statement}} calling for {{an expansion of the}} Air Corps in anticipation of the coming of World War II and the needs of the United States in defending the Western Hemisphere, that Army policy was reversed. Gen. George C.

5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, <b>and</b> <b>strengths</b> and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Essence is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's essence capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum essence summons a creature which costs 20 essence, their maximum essence is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain essence. A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more essence to create. The types <b>and</b> <b>strengths</b> of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations' statistics, but every statistic increase costs more essence and reduces the amount of essence available to summon other creations or cast spells. Essence and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Very few sports use only endurance or strength. Outside of running long distances {{on a flat}} surface and power-lifting, practically all sports require some combi-nation of endurance <b>and</b> <b>strength.</b> Endurance <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> can be developed simultaneously to some degree. How-ever, the development of a high level of endurance seems to prohibit the development or maintenance of muscle mass <b>and</b> <b>strength.</b> This interaction between endurance <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> is called the concurrent training effect. This review specifically defines the concurrent training effect, discusses the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, and proposes strategies to maximize <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> endurance in the high-level athlete...|$|R

25|$|Positioned behind home plate, {{the catcher}} {{can see the}} whole field, and is {{therefore}} {{in the best position}} to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls are based on the pitcher's mechanics <b>and</b> <b>strengths,</b> as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt.|$|E
25|$|The {{saxophone}} uses a single-reed mouthpiece {{similar to}} that of the clarinet. Most saxophonists use reeds made from Arundo donax cane, but since the 20th century some have also been made of fiberglass and other composite materials. Saxophone reeds are proportioned slightly differently from clarinet reeds, being wider for the same length, although some soprano saxophonists use clarinet reeds. Each size of saxophone (alto, tenor, etc.) uses a different size of reed. Reeds are commercially available in a vast array of brands, styles, <b>and</b> <b>strengths.</b> Saxophonists experiment with reeds of different strength (hardnesses) and material to find which strength and cut suits their mouthpiece, embouchure, physiology, and playing style.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Dutch historians {{believed}} that the Franks, Frisians, and Saxons were the original ancestors of the Dutch people. Some went further by ascribing certain attributes, values <b>and</b> <b>strengths</b> to these various groups and proposing that they reflected 19th-century nationalist and religious views. In particular, {{it was believed that}} this theory explained why Belgium and the southern Netherlands (i.e. the Franks) had become Catholic and the northern Netherlands (Frisians and Saxons) had become Protestant. The success of this theory was partly due to anthropological theories based on a tribal paradigm. Being politically and geographically inclusive, and yet accounting for diversity, this theory was in accordance with the need for nation-building and integration during the 1890–1914 period. The theory was taught in Dutch schools.|$|E
25|$|After {{a failed}} event in February 1901, the society became barely active and a {{liquidation}} meeting {{was called for}} December 1903. However, the meeting instead elected new chairman Jonas Vanagaitis who revived the organization. However, until 1908 the society was not very active as Vanagaitis and other members were more involved and focused on activities of the Lithuanian Union in Prussia (Lietuvininkų susivienijimas Prūsuose). In 1905, Birutė assisted the Lithuanian Literary Society with building the Lithuanian House in the Jakobsruh Park in Tilsit. In 1905, the society celebrated its 20th anniversary. The celebration included two plays written and staged by Vydūnas and his Lithuanian Choir. The plays were specifically written for the occasion and poked fun at Birutė's weaknesses <b>and</b> <b>strengths.</b>|$|E

David was formally charged as a spy and taken to the military prison (on the site of the present Arkansas State Capitol building). Dodd was interrogated for two days by Union officers who tried to discover the source of the information. On the third day, under personal orders from Gen. Steele, Mary Dodge and her father were escorted under armed guard to a Union gunboat on the Arkansas River and transported to Vermont, where Mary was kept {{until the end of the}} war.

25|$|A protracted, {{integrated}} {{strategy that}} maximized Northern strengths against {{the weaknesses of}} their Southern and American opponents. This was the strategy of protracted war, that tightly integrated political and military factors, and slowly weakened opposition over time by an attritional campaign. Protracted war also involved sequencing a mix of combat styles. This ranged from small-scale guerrilla attacks, to main-force battles that even when costly, atrophied enemy strength and morale. It also drew powerful US forces into peripheral areas, while allowing VC/NVA forces to control the key to any People's War, the population. All these measures were keyed to political ends, and included ruthless assassination, kidnapping and sabotage efforts throughout the war. To some US soldiers who fought against the VC/NVA, like US Lt. General Phillip Davidson, Chief of Military Intelligence from 1967 to 69, and US war historians like Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr. this strategy was a superior one in terms of Communist objectives <b>and</b> <b>strengths,</b> and American/GVN weaknesses.|$|E
25|$|Although some single-player {{role-playing}} games {{give the}} player an avatar {{that is largely}} predefined {{for the sake of}} telling a specific story, many role-playing games make use of a character creation screen. This allows players to choose their character's sex, their race or species, and their character class. Although many of theses traits are cosmetic, there are functional aspects as well. Character classes will have different abilities <b>and</b> <b>strengths.</b> Common classes include fighters, spellcasters, thieves with stealth abilities, and clerics with healing abilities, or a mixed class, such as a fighter who can cast simple spells. Characters will also have a range of physical attributes such as dexterity and strength, which affect a player's performance in combat. Mental attributes such as intelligence may affect a player's ability to perform and learn spells, while social attributes such as charisma may limit the player's choices while conversing with non-player characters. These attribute systems often strongly resemble the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.|$|E
25|$|One {{mechanism}} for preserving the dynamic {{range of a}} neuron is synaptic scaling, the homeostatic form of plasticity that restores neuronal activity to its normal 'baseline' levels by changing the postsynaptic response of all the synapses of a neuron {{as a function of}} activity. This means that the same scaling is done to each synapse, to either strengthen or weaken all of a neuron’s connections. Scaling can be multiplicative (multiplying or dividing the strength of each synapse by a constant number) or additive (adding or subtracting the same value from the synaptic weight). Homeostatic mechanisms go beyond the synapse. Modulation of the intrinsic excitability of a neuron is a way to maintain stability despite changing numbers <b>and</b> <b>strengths</b> of synapses. Cultured cortical pyramidal neurons maintain stability through the regulation of ionic conductances. The regulation of ionic conductances is achieved through the controlled release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF has also been found to influence synaptic scaling, suggesting that this neurotrophic factor may be responsible for the coordination of synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms in homeostatic plasticity.|$|E
