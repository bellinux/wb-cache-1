25|$|Cimex lectularius {{males have}} {{environmental}} microbes on their genitals. These microbes damage sperm cells, leaving them unable to fertilize female gametes. Due to these dangerous microbes, males have evolved antimicrobial ejaculate substances that prevent sperm damage. When the microbes contact sperm or the male genitals, the bed bug releases <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances.</b> Many species of these microbes {{live in the}} bodies of females after mating. The microbes can cause infections in the females. It {{has been suggested that}} females receive benefit from the ejaculate.

40|$|AbstractStreptomyces lunalinharesii strain 235 {{produces}} an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> that is active against sulfate reducing bacteria, the major bacterial group responsible for biofilm formation and biocorrosion in petroleum reservoirs. The {{use of this}} <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> for sulfate reducing bacteria control is therefore a promising alternative to chemical biocides. In this study the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> did {{not interfere with the}} biofilm stability, but the sulfate reducing bacteria biofilm formation was six-fold smaller in carbon steel coupons treated with the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> when compared to the untreated control. A reduction in the most probable number counts of planktonic cells of sulfate reducing bacteria was observed after treatments with the sub-minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal inhibitory concentration, and supra-minimal inhibitory concentration of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance.</b> Additionally, when the treated coupons were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, the biofilm formation was found to be substantially reduced when the supra-minimal inhibitory concentration of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> was used. The coupons used for the biofilm formation had a small weight loss after <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> treatment, but corrosion damage was not observed by scanning electron microscopy. The absence of the dsrA gene fragment in the scraped cell suspension after treatment with the supra-minimal inhibitory concentration of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> suggests that Desulfovibrio alaskensis was not able to adhere to the coupons. This is the first report on an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> produced by Streptomyces active against sulfate reducing bacteria biofilm formation. The application of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> as a potential biocide for sulfate reducing bacteria growth control could be of great interest to the petroleum industry...|$|R

In the present study, <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chicken was detected, characterized, and purified. Based on 16 S rRNA sequencing, the bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum vN. The <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> produced by this bacterium was designated vN- 1 and exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against many important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Erwinia amylovova. vN- 1 was determined to be thermostable, insensitive to pH values ranging from 2. 0 to 8. 0, resistant to various organic solvents and to enzymatic inactivation. The inhibition kinetics displayed a bactericidal mode of action. This study revealed an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> with low molecular mass of less than 1 kDa as determined by ultrafiltration and having features not previously reported for LAB isolated from chicken intestines.

40|$|Summary. A Bacillus strain {{producing}} a bacteriocin-like substance was charac-terized by biochemical profiling and 16 S rDNA sequencing. Phylogenetic {{analysis indicated that}} the strain has high sequence similarity with Bacillus amyloliquefa-ciens. The <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> was inhibitory to pathogenic and food-spoilage bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens, and Pasteurella haemolytica. It was stable over a wide temperature range, but lost activity {{when the temperature reached}} 121 °C/ 15 min. Maximum activity was observed at acidic and neutral pH values, but not at alkaline pH. The <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> was sensitive to the proteolytic action of trypsin, papain, proteinase K, and pronase E.
