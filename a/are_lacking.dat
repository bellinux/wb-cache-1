5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All <b>are</b> <b>lacking,</b> she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E

Teleodesmacea {{on the other}} hand have a porcelanous and partly nacreous shell structure; Mantle lobes that are generally connected, well developed siphons, and specialized hinge teeth. In most, gills are eulamellibranch.|$|E

5|$|Silver is an {{extremely}} soft, ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver <b>are</b> <b>lacking</b> a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} system in Belarus lacks independence and {{is subject to}} political interference. Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and whistleblower protection and national ombudsman <b>are</b> <b>lacking</b> in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, {{and the government has}} made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, <b>are</b> <b>lacking</b> in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E

His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} responses in the player that other games <b>are</b> <b>lacking.</b> Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E
5|$|Copper, silver, {{and gold}} are in group 11 of the {{periodic}} table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron {{on top of}} a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper <b>are</b> <b>lacking</b> a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 census gave a total {{population}} of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population {{at the time was}} mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the Yangbajain Geothermal Station. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities <b>are</b> <b>lacking.</b> Tibetan Buddhism and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other demersal fishing gear. It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data <b>are</b> <b>lacking,</b> but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien based Quenya {{pronunciation}} more on Latin than on Finnish. Thus, Quenya {{lacks the}} vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish, and accent {{is not always}} on the first syllable of a word. Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö, ä and y <b>are</b> <b>lacking</b> in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or {{the development of the}} syllables ti > si in both languages. The combination of a Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien's favourite modern Romance language.|$|E

5|$|With {{the decline}} of the Byzantine fleet in the latter 12th century, the Empire {{increasingly}} relied on the fleets of Venice and Genoa. Following the sack of 1204 however, sources suggest the presence of a relatively strong fleet already under the first Nicaean emperor, Theodore I Laskaris, although specific details <b>are</b> <b>lacking.</b> Under John III and Theodore II (1254–1258), the navy had two main strategic areas of operations: the Aegean, entailing operations against the Greek islands (chiefly Rhodes) as well as the transport and supply of armies fighting in the Balkans, and the Sea of Marmara, where the Nicaeans aimed to interdict Latin shipping and threaten Constantinople. Smyrna provided the main shipyard and base for the Aegean, with a secondary one at Stadeia, while the main base for operations in the Marmara Sea was Holkos, near Lampsakos across the Gallipoli peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Around 1498, Josquin {{most likely}} re-entered {{the service of}} the Sforza family, on the {{evidence}} of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families. He probably did not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career {{around the turn of the}} 16th century <b>are</b> <b>lacking.</b> Prior to departing Italy he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi ("I have placed my hope in you, Lord"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the 31 {{described}} {{species of}} Monoplacophora (a class of mollusks) live below 2000meters. Of these 11 species, two live {{exclusively in the}} hadal zone. The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches. However, no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet {{been found in the}} Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean. Of the 922 known species of chitons (from the Polyplacophora class of mollusks), 22 species (2.4%) are reported to live below 2000meters and two of them are restricted to the abyssal plain. Although genetic studies <b>are</b> <b>lacking,</b> at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic (capable of living {{in a wide range of}} depths), having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths. A large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous, which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world's oceans.|$|E
