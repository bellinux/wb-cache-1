5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This {{was a turning point}} for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>first</b> step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>first</b> step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

PAOK won the Greek Cup. Katsabis captained the club in the final, a match held in Nikos Goumas Stadium, Athens that found PAOK victorious against Olympiacos by 4–2. In the league Katsabis featured in 23 matches and scored 2 goals.

2500|$|However, {{the process}} of {{separating}} “baseflow” from “direct runoff” is an inexact science. [...] In part this is because these two concepts are not, themselves, entirely distinct and unrelated.

[...] Therefore, separation of a purely “baseflow component” in a hydrograph is a somewhat arbitrary exercise. [...] Nevertheless, various graphical and empirical techniques have been developed to perform these hydrograph separations.
