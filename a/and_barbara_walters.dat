25|$|On January 6, 1975, ABC {{launched}} AM America in {{an attempt}} to compete with NBC's Today. The program was hosted by Bill Beutel and Stephanie Edwards, with Peter Jennings and Robert Kennedy reading the news. Because the show could not find an audience against Today (and its anchor team of Jim Hartz <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters),</b> ABC sought a new approach. The network found that one of its affiliates, WEWS in Cleveland, Ohio, had been pre-empting AM America in favor of airing a locally produced show called The Morning Exchange.|$|E

While NBC continued coverage of Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets at Madison Square Garden, the game appeared in a small box in the corner while Tom Brokaw as anchorman covered the chase. The chase was covered live by ABC News anchors Peter Jennings <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters</b> on behalf of ABC's five news magazines, which achieved some of their highest-ever ratings that week. Benefiting from the event occurring in the evening, Domino's Pizza stated that its pizza delivery sales during the televised chase were as large as on Super Bowl Sunday.|$|E

500|$|The real Mark David Chapman is {{currently}} incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters,</b> both in 1992, {{he has not}} spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title [...] "Chapter 27" [...] suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has 26 chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, {{to the point of}} attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, ABC News and its newly {{installed}} president, Roone Arledge, {{were preparing}} {{an overhaul of}} its nightly news program, which was then known as ABC Evening News and whose ratings had languished in third place behind CBS and NBC since its inception. In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of Harry Reasoner <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters</b> at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas. Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program. On July 10, 1978, World News Tonight debuted with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago, and Jennings in London. Jennings' official title was [...] "Foreign Desk Anchor," [...] although he continued {{to serve as the}} network's chief foreign correspondent. By the summer of 1979, the innovative broadcast, which featured some of the same glitzy presentation as Arledge's previous television coup, Wide World of Sports, had climbed in the ratings. The newscast had gained 1.9 million households from its debut, and was now in a dead heat with NBC's evening newscast.|$|E

Using a hazards analysis of all civil wars and associated third party interventions between 1945 and 2013 in addition to three structured, focused case studies, I argue that peace enforcement operations that 1) utilize the appropriate typological spoiler management strategy and 2) maintain legitimacy and impartiality through close cooperation with UN peacekeepers, are the most successful at catalyzing civil war termination and securing durable peace. I also provide a theoretical framework through which to study peace enforcement operations that builds upon Stephen Stedman <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walter’s</b> conceptualization of spoilers, third party security guarantees, and the strategic alteration of belligerent cost-benefit calculus...|$|R

A $155 bottle of Pinot Noir is uncorked here, chilled oysters delivered there and a bow given every now and then." [...] The New York Times also reported on the transformation of the hotel: [...] "The striped silk-and-walnut Tower Bar restaurant is already a retro clubhouse for the mature Hollywood set (think Brian Grazer <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters),</b> complete with $13 martinis and the octogenarian former Sinatra pianist Page Cavanaugh tickling the ivories. On a Friday night in mid-December, Anjelica Huston and Courtney Love swanned by to dine with a 30-something crowd far more sophisticated than the teenyboppers roaming Sunset Boulevard outside." [...] Other celebrities visiting the Tower Bar include Sean Penn, Victoria Beckham, Tom Cruise and Jennifer Lopez. [...] Dmitri Dmitrov, a 60-year-old Macedonian immigrant with Rudolph Valentino hair, is the Tower Bar's maître d’hôtel. [...] Dmitrov is a sphinxlike figure who knows everything and says nothing. [...] In the six years since Klein, following a suggestion from the designer Tom Ford, rescued Dmitrov from a fading career at drearily elegant places like a local Russian restaurant that featured a harpist, ice swans and a caviar menu, he has become a Hollywood institution. [...] In February 2007, the New York Post reported that the hotel's front desk manager was nearly fired when Lindsay Lohan tried to book three rooms. [...] Owner Jeff Klein was reportedly overheard yelling at the manager, [...] "If that piece of trailer trash so much as enters my driveway, you are fired. She can't come here with all my chic guests, she'll ruin the place." [...] Also in 2007, Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs showed up with an entourage to attend a Golden Globes party, and was told his name was not on the list.

40|$|I {{present a}} model of {{interactions}} between voters, a government, and a terrorist organization. The model focuses on a previously unexplored conceptualization of counterterrorism as divided into tactic-specific observable and general unobservable tactics. When there is divergence between voters and government preferences, strategic substitution among different modes of attack by terrorists and agency problems between the voters and government create {{a situation in which}} the politically optimal counterterrorism strategy pursued by the government in response to electoral and institutional incentives is quite different from the security maximizing counterterrorism strategy. In particular, in response to electoral pressure, the government allocates resources to observable counterterror in excess of the social optimum. This problem is particularly severe when governments put great weight on rent-seeking or care less about counterterror than do voters and when terrorists have a large set of tactics from which to choose. Voters can decrease the magnitude of the agency problem by increasing the benefits of reelection by, for example, slackening requirements for nonsecurity related public goods.
