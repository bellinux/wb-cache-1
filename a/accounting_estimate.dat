40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the effect of analytical review results on auditors' effort of auditing <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates.</b> Other objectives involve examining the moderating effect of personality traits (optimism), patterns-for-coping (vigilance), and level of experience on auditors' effort of auditing <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates.</b> In examining the effects of optimism and vigilance on auditing <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates,</b> the study makes a significant original contribution to the extant literature in audit judgement. The subjects were public accountants at different levels from both Big Six as well as non-Big Six firms. The findings of the study indicate that auditors' perceptions to extend tests of details related to the balances of the <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates,</b> according to the audit hours allocated to the budgeted time plan, did vary significantly across treatment groups. The analytical review results and the two dimensions of the individual psychological differences influenced their confidence in their assignment of the audit effort. Analytical review results were found to affect the audit plan for <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> when these results signaled fluctuations. However, the conservatism tendency found by previous studies {{was found to be}} valid in this study.

40|$|Motivated by {{the current}} PCAOB {{proposed}} standard regarding expansion of the auditor’s reporting model, this study investigates the effect of auditor reporting choice on management disclosure decisions. The proposed standard would require auditors to identify and provide information about the most significant audit and financial reporting issues encountered during the audit in a new section of the audit report on Critical Audit Matters (CAMs). I develop theory to predict how auditor choices about reporting on CAMs might affect manager disclosure decisions. In addition, the study investigates how the effect of auditor reporting choice on management disclosure decisions depends on a very important governance structure, the audit committee. I find that management reacts to the auditor shining a spotlight on a highly uncertain critical <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate</b> by increasing their own disclosure of the matter and that this effect varies directly with {{the strength of the}} audit committee’s oversight. In addition, I find that as auditors increase the level of detail provided by the auditor in its CAM reporting, management responds with increased disclosure. Finally, when the auditor provides a detailed CAM discussion, it appears that managers are likely to increase disclosure of quantitative information that would enhance the financial statement user’s ability to quantify the risk in a critical <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate.</b> The study provides ex ante insights on how a mandated change in the auditor’s reporting model might affect the level of information provided by management and received by investors...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examines}} {{the decision to}} implement subcertification, a system of certifications of financial data by the subordinate employees who provide that data. Subcertification is intended to increase employee effort {{to ensure that the}} reported financial data is accurate and can be defended. I experimentally explore the effects of subcertification on subordinate effort and justification when generating an <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate,</b> predicting that both will increase. Despite the expected benefits of imposing subcertification, it has not been universally adopted. One widely-cited reason for not adopting is concern about the impact on corporate culture and manager-subordinate relationships. I document the direct effects of relationship quality between a manager and subordinate on subordinate behavior, expecting a higher quality relationship to lead to increased effort and justification. In this draft, I provide pilot data consistent with relationship quality directly affecting the amount of effort participants exert in researching the appropriate <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate.</b> I subsequently document the effects of the decision to subcertify on relationship quality, predicting that subordinate response depends upon the existing manager-subordinate relationship. Collectively, the expected findings of this study are of particular importance to managerial accountants in practice who are charged with control system design and implementation decisions. Further, to the extent that greater effort yields higher quality estimates and, in turn, higher quality financial statements, this study has implications for the internal financial reporting process as well.

40|$|AbstractAccounting {{estimates}} {{occur because}} {{a large number}} of items in financial statements cannot be measured precisely but can only be <b>estimated.</b> Significant <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

The research included 132 quoted companies in Croatia that apply IFRSs. The research results showed that investment property has a relatively small share in the structure of total assets of quoted companies in Croatia, which {{is probably one of the}} reasons why related <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> published in the notes are brief and incomplete. The general conclusion is that the notes regarding <b>accounting</b> <b>estimates</b> on investment property are composed of definitions set in the standard, instead of providing more transparent information for investors and other interested users of financial statements.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examines}} {{the decision to}} impose a control system and the resulting impact on the effort exerted by the controlled individual. I specifically consider subcertification, a system of certifications of financial data by the subordinate employees who provide that data. Despite the expected benefits of subcertification, {{it has not been}} universally adopted, largely due to concern about the impact on corporate culture and manager-subordinate relationships. To explore this concern, I examine the direct effects of relationship quality between a manager and subordinate on subordinate behavior when generating an <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate.</b> I provide evidence consistent with subordinates in high quality relationships exerting greater effort than those in low quality relationships. I next consider the effects of the decision to require subcertification on effort, finding that subordinate response to the control depends upon the existing relationship quality; high quality relationship subordinates decrease effort while low quality relationship subordinates increase effort. The findings I present are of particular importance to managerial accountants who are charged with control system design and implementation decisions. To the extent that greater effort yields higher quality estimates, this study ha...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the northern hemisphere}} (NH) terrestrial carbon sink by comparing four recent atmospheric inversions with land-based C accounting data for six large northern regions. The mean NH terrestrial CO 2 sink from the inversion models is 1. 7 Pg C year- 1 over the period 2000 – 2004. The uncertainty of this estimate {{is based on the}} typical individual (1 -sigma) precision of one inversion (0. 9 Pg C year- 1) and is consistent with the min–max range of the four inversion mean estimates (0. 8 Pg C year- 1). Inversions agree within their uncertainty for the distribution of the NH sink of CO 2 in longitude, with Russia being the largest sink. The land-based <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate</b> of NH carbon sink is 1. 7 Pg C year- 1 for the sum of the six regions studied. The 1 -sigma uncertainty of the land-based estimate (0. 3 Pg C year- 1) is smaller than that of atmospheric inversions, but no independent land-based flux estimate is available to derive a ‘between accounting model’ uncertainty. Encouragingly, the top-down atmospheric and the bottom-up land-based methods converge to consistent mean estimates within their respective errors, increasing the confidence in the overall budget. These results also confirm the continued critical role of NH terrestrial ecosystems in slowing down the atmospheric accumulation of anthropogenic CO...|$|E

40|$|The spin {{period to}} {{precession}} period ratio of a non-axisymmetric spin-stabilized spacecraft, the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), {{was used to}} estimate the remaining mass and distribution of fuel within its propulsion system. This analysis was undertaken once telemetry suggested {{that two of the}} four fuel tanks had no propellant remaining, contrary to pre-launch expectations of the propulsion system performance. Numerical integration of possible fuel distributions was used to calculate moments of inertia for the spinning spacecraft. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of output from a dynamics simulation was employed to relate calculated moments of inertia to spin and precession periods. The resulting modeled ratios were compared to the actual spin period to precession period ratio derived from the effect of post-maneuver nutation angle on sun sensor measurements. A Monte Carlo search was performed to tune free parameters using the observed spin period to precession period ratio {{over the life of the}} mission. This novel analysis of spin and precession periods indicates that at the time of launch, propellant was distributed unevenly between the two pairs of fuel tanks, with one pair having approximately 20 % more propellant than the other pair. Furthermore, it indicates the pair of the tanks with less fuel expelled all of its propellant by 2014 and that approximately 46 kg of propellant remains in the other two tanks, an amount that closely matches the operational fuel <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate.</b> Keywords: Fuel Distribution, Moments of Inertia, Precession, Spin, Nutatio...|$|E
40|$|The proper {{evaluation}} of accounting objects influences essentially upon {{the reliability of}} assessing the financial situation of a company. Thus, the problem in <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate</b> is quite relevant. The works of home and foreign scholars {{on the issues of}} assessment of accounting objects, regulatory and legal acts of Ukraine controlling the accounting and compiling financial reporting are a methodological basis for the research. The author uses the theoretical methods of cognition (abstraction and generalization, analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction and other methods producing conceptual knowledge) for the synthesis of theoretical and methodological principles in the {{evaluation of}} assets accounting, liabilities and equity. The tabular presentation and information comparison methods are used for analytical researches. The article considers the modern approaches to the issue of evaluation of accounting objects and financial statements items. The expedience to keep records under historical value is proved and the articles of financial statements are to be presented according to the evaluation on the reporting date. In connection with the evaluation the depreciation of fixed assets is considered as a process of systematic return into circulation of the before advanced funds on the purchase (production, improvement) of fixed assets and intangible assets by means of including the amount of wear in production costs. Therefore it is proposed to amortize only the actual costs incurred, i. e. not to depreciate the fixed assets received free of charge and surplus valuation of different kinds...|$|E
40|$|In late 2001, {{soon after}} {{numerous}} financial reporting failures including the much publicized demise of Enron, the SEC {{began a series}} of initiatives to improve critical accounting policy (CAP) and critical <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate</b> disclosures included within the MD 2 ̆ 6 A section of Form 10 -K. The first announcement, in the form of cautionary guidance, was issued in December 2001. This was followed by a Proposed Rule in 2002, and additional disclosure guidance near the end of 2003. Combined, the guidance required companies to provide information that would help investors understand the impact of estimates, accounting policies and external factors on financial results. Through 2007, the SEC continued to provide guidance as to the content of CAP disclosures in the MD 2 ̆ 6 A. In this study, we assess the extent to which companies responded to the initial CAP guidance, and {{determine the extent to which}} company disclosures changed with additional SEC guidance by analyzing CAP disclosures included in the 2001 and 2003 10 -K filings for 112 of the Mid-Cap 400 companies. Our findings indicate that most, but not all, sampled companies included 2001 CAP disclosures consistent with the cautionary advice. We find that the disclosure content increased from 2001 to 2003, and that the disclosure quality also increased. However, some items remained underdisclosed in 2003, indicating that even after a 2 -year period in which the SEC continued to provide additional guidance and reviewed company CAP disclosures, companies were not fully disclosing content identified as important by the SEC, particularly when the guidance was included in the Proposed Rule...|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called on firms to provide new MD 2 ̆ 6 A {{disclosures}} about their critical accounting estimates. The new disclosures outline how reasonably likely changes in firms 2 ̆ 7 highly uncertain accounting estimates would affect earnings. Because the new disclosure practice potentially highlights accrual estimates with a reduced level of reliability (i. e. greater estimation error) arising from {{uncertainty in the}} accrual measurement process, I examine whether {{the presence of a}} critical <b>accounting</b> <b>estimate</b> (CAE) disclosure partially explains cross-sectional variation in the value relevance of balance sheet items. Using a sample of non-financial and non-utility S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 firms from 2004 to 2009, I find the value relevance of a balance sheet item is negatively associated with the presence of a related CAE disclosure. To corroborate my value relevance findings, I also examine whether the predictive value of accruals with respect to future cash flows and accrual noise, which are two accounting-based characteristics of useful accounting information, are associated with the presence of a CAE disclosure. I find the incremental predictive value of accruals with respect to future cash flows (accrual noise) is negatively (positively) associated with the presence of a CAE disclosure. Overall, these results suggest investors perceive balance sheet items accompanied by a related, account-specific CAE disclosure to have lower reliability, and consistent with investors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions, accrual estimates have less predictive value and are noisier when these disclosures are present. Other findings indicate that the magnitude of estimation error and disclosure complexity {{play a role in the}} extent to which investors reduce their reliability perceptions in the presence of a CAE disclosure...|$|E
