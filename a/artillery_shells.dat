5|$|Ellet's men {{returned}} to De Soto Point and constructed an artillery battery targeting an iron foundry recasting spent Union <b>artillery</b> <b>shells.</b> Construction was begun on June 19, which placed a 20-pounder Parrott rifle in a casemate of railroad iron. The targeted foundry was destroyed on June 25 {{and the next}} day a second Parrott gun was added to the battery, which continued to harass the defenders until the garrison's surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of major industries improved markedly during the war. For example, the Singer Clydebank sewing machine factory received over 5000 government contracts, and made 303 million <b>artillery</b> <b>shells,</b> shell components, fuzes, and airplane parts, {{as well as}} grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour force of 14,000 was about 70 percent female at war's end.|$|E
5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E

5|$|On 26 August, the JNA {{attacked}} Kijevo, {{opposed by}} 58 policemen armed with small arms only and commanded by police station chief Martin Čičin Šain. Between 05:18 and 13:00, the JNA fired 1,500 <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> against the village, and the Yugoslav Air Force supported the attack with 34 {{close air support}} sorties. The same afternoon, the JNA mounted a ground force assault on Kijevo. According to Martić, each house in Kijevo was fired upon. The attacking force consisted of approximately 30 tanks supported by JNA infantry and Croatian Serb militia.|$|E
5|$|In early October, the NVA had {{intensified}} battalion-size ground probes {{and sustained}} artillery fire against Con Thien, a hilltop stronghold {{in the center}} of the Marines' defensive line south of the DMZ in northern Quang Tri Province. Mortar rounds, <b>artillery</b> <b>shells,</b> and 122mm rockets fell randomly, but incessantly upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds. Westmoreland responded by launching Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped from 35,000 to 40,000 tons of bombs in nearly 4,000 airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|Many Croatian {{cities were}} {{attacked}} by artillery, missiles, and aircraft bombs by RSK or JNA forces from RSK or Serb-controlled areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Montenegro and Serbia. The most shelled cities were Vukovar, Slavonski Brod (from the mountain of Vučjak), and Županja (for more than 1,000 days), Vinkovci, Osijek, Nova Gradiška, Novska, Daruvar, Pakrac, Šibenik, Sisak, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Gospić, Karlovac, Biograd na moru, Slavonski Šamac, Ogulin, Duga Resa, Otočac, Ilok, Beli Manastir, Lučko, Zagreb, and others Slavonski Brod was never directly attacked by tanks or infantry, but {{the city and its}} surrounding villages were hit by more than 11,600 <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> and 130 aircraft bombs in 1991 and 1992.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} regrouped at Pyongtaek itself, {{mostly a}} mass of disorganized soldiers without leadership. Engineers with the battalion demolished a bridge north of the town before moving south. The remains of A Company then headed for Cheonan, regrouping there {{with the rest of}} the 1st and 3rd Battalions which had also withdrawn. Though a few jeeps and trucks were found and commandeered, most of the retreat was carried out on foot. A few scattered <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> landed around the retreating force, but North Korean soldiers did not aggressively pursue them. By noon the disorganized remains of the 34th Infantry had outrun all enemy fire and were out of immediate danger.|$|E
5|$|AMX-30 {{production}} {{occurred at}} the Atelier de Construction de Roanne {{in the town of}} Roanne. This heavy manufacturing factory was built during World War I to produce <b>artillery</b> <b>shells,</b> although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the Atelier de Construction de Limoges, the full armour set by the Ateliers et Forges de la Loire, the turret by the Atelier de Construction de Tarbes, the cannon by the Atelier de Construction de Bourges, the cupola and machine-gun by the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne and the optics by the Atelier de Construction de Puteaux; all these again used many subcontractors. In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the battle, the JNA and the paramilitaries pushed the Croatian force out of eastern Gospić. On 5 September, Croatian forces {{captured}} JNA Major General Trajče Krstevski, along with three armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and 32 soldiers, when he attempted to reach JNA barracks that were isolated in the centre of the town but released them the next day following the successful negotiation of a prisoner exchange (POWs). The Croatian commanders in Gospić, however, declined a request that the APCs also be returned—contrary to the instructions of Croatian authorities in Zagreb. Following the capture of Krstevski, the JNA artillery bombardment intensified, averaging 1,100 <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> per day. Despite the intense bombardment, the second week of the battle was a stalemate, without any changes in lines of control.|$|E

5|$|By March 10, several South Vietnamese {{units were}} {{defeated}} {{in their attempts}} to hold off the North Vietnamese; the 1st battalion of 54th Infantry Regiments of ARVN 1st Division (South Vietnam) was destroyed on Hill 224 and 273; the ARVN 47th Armoured Squadron was overrun by the VPA 1st Regiment, 324th Division, on Mount Nghe; and the ARVN 113th Regional Force Battalion conceded Pho Lai to the VPA 4th Regiment, which was supported by the 223rd Artillery Regiment. General Thi then ordered the 15th Ranger Group and the 2nd Battalion of the 54th Infantry Regiment, with support from the 27th and 37th Tank Squadrons, to mount a counter-attack on Hill 224. Over the period of one week, both sides fired over 8,000 rounds of <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> on Hill 224, and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted over 60 bombing sorties in an attempt to halt the advances of the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps.|$|E
5|$|During its height, the {{intensity}} of the bombardment was reported to reach as high as one shell per minute, and the artillery attacks were compounded by Yugoslav Air Force strikes against the city. According to Croatian sources, a total of 6,000 <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> were fired against Osijek in the period. Prior {{to the start of the}} bombardment, the civilian population of Osijek totaled 104,761 city residents and 129,792 municipal residents. These numbers were significantly reduced as civilians fled the fighting. It is estimated that only about a third of the population remained in the city by the end of November, with some sources placing the estimate even lower, suggesting that the population of the city was reduced to just 10,000 civilians during the most intense periods of the bombardment. Those who remained in Osijek through the fighting generally slept in bomb shelters.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 nuclear artillery shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest nuclear artillery, and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to have nuclear shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its nuclear <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> from service, and dismantling of the US nuclear artillery inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|While the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was {{transporting}} the 23rd Infantry Division to the battlefield, their airbase at Cu Hanh {{was subjected}} to artillery bombardment from the North Vietnamese 968th Infantry Division. The North Vietnamese Central Highlands Front had anticipated the South Vietnamese military's movements, so they built up their forces in and around Ban Me Thuot {{to prepare for a}} South Vietnamese counter-attack. On March 13, the North Vietnamese 24th and 28th Regiments received two companies of armoured vehicles and one artillery battalion, which had begun raining <b>artillery</b> <b>shells</b> on Phuoc An. At 7:07am on March 14, even before the ARVN 44th and 45th Infantry Regiments began their combat operations, the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment opened fire and attacked the South Vietnamese, with support from the 273rd Armoured Regiment.|$|E
