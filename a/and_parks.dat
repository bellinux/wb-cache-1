5|$|The Superintendent of Waterways <b>and</b> <b>Parks</b> (Shuiheng duwei 水衡都尉) {{was also}} known as the Chief Commandant of Waterways <b>and</b> <b>Parks,</b> and was once a {{subordinate}} of the Minister Steward until 115 BC, when he, and other former subordinates of that ministry, became independent officers. His salary-rank was equivalent to 2000–dan. The Superintendent of Waterways <b>and</b> <b>Parks</b> managed a large imperial hunting park located outside Chang'an, including its palaces, rest stops, granaries, and cultivated patches of fruit and vegetable gardens, which, along with game meat, provided food for the emperor's household. He also collected taxes from commoners using the park's grounds and transmitted these funds to the Minister Steward, who managed the emperor's finances. One of the Superintendent's subordinates supervised convicted criminals in their care of the park's hunting dogs.|$|E

5|$|In 115 BC {{the central}} government's mint was {{transferred}} from the Minister Steward's ministry to the park managed by the Superintendent of Waterways <b>and</b> <b>Parks.</b> In 113 BC the central government closed all commandery-level mints; private minting had previously been outlawed in 144 BC. The Superintendent's imperial mint in the park outside Chang'an had the sole right to issue coinage throughout the empire. However, Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25–57 AD) abolished the Superintendent of Waterways <b>and</b> <b>Parks</b> and revived his post annually during autumn to conduct a ritual sacrifice. The imperial mint became {{the responsibility of the}} Minister of Finance and the imperial park located outside Eastern-Han Luoyang was administered by a prefect.|$|E

40|$|Buildings can be located, {{designed}} {{and managed to}} optimize transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> efficiency. This paper describes ways to improve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> credits. Typical LEED programs reduce building energy consumption 20 - 60 %. Cost effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs can provide similar motor vehicle trip <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> generation reductions, resulting in large economic, social and environmental benefits. However, the current LEED rating system overlooks {{some of the most}} effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management strategies <b>and</b> encourages practitioners to choose strategies based on ease of implementation rather than effectiveness. As a result, the current LEED rating system is unlikely to implement mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management to the degree optimal. This paper recommends a different approach which defines performance targets needed to achieve LEED categories (silver, gold, platinum). Developers would establish mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management plans that indicate how targets will be met, how performance will be evaluated, and what additional strategies will be deployed if needed to achieve targets. This optimizes mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs, <b>and</b> responds to changing demands. However, it is unnecessary to wait for a major reform to improve and expand LEED transportation credits; new credits proposed in this paper could be quickly incorporated into the existing LEED rating system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{time-dependent}} network equilibrium model that simultaneously considers a traveler's choice of departure time, route, <b>parking</b> location <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration in road networks with multiple user classes <b>and</b> multiple <b>parking</b> facilities. In the proposed model, travelers are differentiated by their trip purpose <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration, parking locations {{are characterized by}} facility type <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge, <b>and</b> the decision-making process of travelers on travel <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> choices is assumed to follow a hierarchical choice structure. The model is formulated as a variational inequality problem, and is solved by a heuristic solution algorithm. Numerical results for two example networks are presented to show the solution quality and investigate the solution sensitivities to some input data. It is found that parking behavior is significantly affected by travel demand, walking distance, <b>parking</b> capacity, <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge. The proposed model provides {{a useful tool for}} studying the complex temporal and spatial interaction between road traffic <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> congestion, <b>and</b> can be used to assess the effects of various <b>parking</b> policies <b>and</b> infrastructure improvements at a strategic level. ...|$|R
