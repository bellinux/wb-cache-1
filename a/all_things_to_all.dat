5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men."

In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.|$|E

It was impossible that a measure on such a subject could fail to awaken the ever ready quarrel between the two camps into which the English establishment, for so many generations, has so unhappily divided {{the life of the}} nation. From the first, the protestant dissenters had been extremely sore at the absence from the bill of any provision for their admission to the remodelled university. Bright, the most illustrious of them, told the House of Commons that he did not care whether so pusillanimous and tinkering an affair as this was passed or not. Dissenters, he said with scorn, are expected always to manifest too much of those inestimable qualities which are spoken of in the Epistle to the Corinthians: 'To hope <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> and <b>to</b> endure <b>all</b> things.' ...|$|R

If it were not for this striving into new creation on the part of living individuals, the universe would go dead, gradually, gradually and fall asunder.

500|$|It was {{initially}} {{announced that the}} Republican Party {{would go to the}} parliamentary election alone and would seek [...] "qualitative majority" [...] in the parliament, and that their goal was the fairness of the electoral process. Surprisingly for many, on 30 March 1999, Vazgen Sargsyan and the runner-up of the 1998 presidential election and Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan issued a joint announcement that they were forming an alliance between the People's Party of Armenia and the Republican Party. It {{came to be known as}} the Unity bloc («Միասնություն» դաշինք), often referred to as Miasnutyun. Vazgen Sargsyan claimed the bloc was a [...] "genuine" [...] alliance and that the two parties had come together to lead Armenia [...] "from a turning point to progress." [...] When asked about the reasons why he joined Demirchyan, Sargsyan said that, [...] "there is no other way out." [...] According to the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Sargsyan [...] "obviously concluded it was better to have the popular Demirchyan as an ally than an opponent," [...] and that [...] "in forming Unity bloc, Sargsyan and Demirchyan overcame whatever ideological differences they may have had, and said they had joined forces to overcome the difficult problems facing Armenia while promoting tolerance in the country’'s political life." [...] In analyst Richard Giragosian's words, the bloc was [...] "an odd mix," [...] however he admitted that it [...] "effectively marginalized the electoral threat" [...] of other parties. Sociologist Levon Baghdasaryan described it as [...] "unification of the new and old nomenklaturas." [...] The British Helsinki Human Rights Group wrote of the Unity bloc that it [...] "aimed to appeal to the electorate by being <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men."

500|$|Byzantine {{accounts}} of Thomas's rebellion state {{that he did}} not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of [...] "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy {{does not seem to have}} been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a [...] "studied ambiguity" [...] towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, [...] "Thomas could be <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men until he had conquered the whole empire, and then he would have time enough to disappoint some of his followers".|$|E
500|$|William III's {{birthday}} fell on 4November, and for orthodox Whigs the {{two days}} therefore became an important double anniversary. [...] William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5November be amended to include thanks for his [...] "happy arrival" [...] and [...] "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. [...] From the 19th century, 5November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. [...] Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. [...] In England though, as one of 49official holidays, for the ruling class 5November became overshadowed by {{events such as the}} birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, {{with the exception of the}} Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely [...] "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". [...] For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. [...] Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. [...] In 1790 The Times reported instances of children [...] "...begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4November 1802 described how [...] "a set of idle fellows... with some horrid figure dressed up as a Guy Faux" [...] were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as [...] "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became [...] "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men". [...] Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of [...] "respectable householders" [...] and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. [...] In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves [...] "guys" [...] terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. [...] Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. [...] In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed Parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in [...] "creeping popery". [...] A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a deep {{study of the}} Reach Control Problem (RCP) for affine systems defined on simplices. Necessary conditions for solvability of the problem by open loop control are presented, improving upon the results in the literature which are for contin-uous state feedback only. So-called reach control indices are introduced and developed which inform on the structural properties of the system which cause continuous state feedbacks to fail. A novel synthesis method is presented consisting of a subdivision algo-rithm based on these indices and an associated piecewise affine feedback. The method is shown to solve RCP for all cases in the literature where continuous state feedback fails, provided it is solvable by open loop control. Textbook examples of existing synthesis methods for RCP are provided. The motivation for studying RCP and its relevance to complex control specifications is illustrated using a biomedical application. ii Dedication To God, the creator of <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>all</b> students throughout the world who were not as fortunate to have received the great learning opportunity that I have been blesse...|$|R

2500|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to sum up almost five centuries of evolution and differentiation among the Anabaptists, five distinctive attributes of Anabaptist Christians can be discerned: Firstly, they do not practice infant baptism – they believe it is important for someone to be old enough to make a mature choice about whether to be baptized and to be a church member. Secondly, Anabaptists have put special emphasis on the New Testament’s teachings on nonviolence and peacemaking. They also have stressed simple, non-materialistic lifestyles, and communities based on service to others or “works of love.” Finally, they have tried to put their understandings of Jesus' teachings into daily practice. As explained by Menno Simons, the 16th-century leader from whom the term “Mennonite” comes: “True evangelical faith cannot lie dormant. It clothes the naked, it feeds the hungry, it comforts the sorrowful, it shelters the destitute and it serves those who harm it. It seeks those who are lost. It binds up what is wounded.

That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible.

Esta tese tem, no final do seu recorte temporal, o apontamento da problematização da construção do sujeito ensimesmado, quando ele se encontra consigo mesmo na sociedade brasileira contemporânea, envolvendo-se em diversos grupos de movimentos sociais com objetivos coletivos. Foi visto e abordado que, ao encontrar-se nos grupos, passa a revelar-se o individualismo do sujeito ensimesmado na realização de atos em prol de si mesmo. O sujeito ensimesmado passa a concentrar em si mesmo a totalidade das coisas, do todo e de tudo, enclausurando-se. Considera-se, portanto, nesta tese, que a barbárie contemporânea tem seu engendramento por meio de novas formas de individualismo, com o nascimento do sujeito ensimesmado. The intellectual restlessness {{that has}} motivated this survey has set itself for defining the person enclosed within himself, clarifying the very beginning, developing his paths {{as a product}} and producer of the reasoning crisis and barbarity as well. The temporal cut has its beginning in the Renaissance, historical {{period in which the}} individual himself reaches a higher level of emancipation and human value (overvalued individuality) indeed. On that specific historical context, the collectiveness is relinquished, turning to individualism. The temporal cut of this thesis points specifically to the construction problem of the person enclosed within himself and his meeting with Brazilian contemporary society, involving with different social groups and their collective aims. It has been seen and approached that when someone is involved with social groups, the individualism of the person enclosed within himself is disclosed, egoistically carrying out his deeds on behalf of himself. The subject enclosed within himself began focusing on himself the totality of <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> from <b>all</b> <b>to</b> everything, enclosing himself. Therefore, this thesis holds the assumption that contemporary barbarity has its thresholds through new ways of individualism with the birth of the person enclosed inside himself...|$|R

Wherefore when he saith he measured the gates, it is as if he had said, he measured the entrance, strength, and goodly countenance of him, with the mansions of glory that are to be enjoyed by every one that entereth in hereby; for the porch, posts, face, entrance, and chambers of the gate in Ezekiel, they signify the entrance, strength, shining countenance, and resting places that every one shall find in the Lord Jesus that entereth in by him; and <b>to</b> measure <b>all</b> these, it is in substance but this, to set them forth, and out, in their full force, glory, largeness, beauty, and profitableness, in the view of all; for I told you at the first, the golden reed is the Word of God. Now the city and the gates thereof, are said to be measured by this golden reed: which, I say, can be nothing else but an opening of all the excellencies of Christ, as he is the gate of the sheep, even by the full sway, power, majesty, and clearness of the Word. The Lord help us! Christ, as he is the door to God, and <b>to</b> <b>all</b> gospel-privileges, is now strangely handled, and so hath been of a long time among the sons of men; some of them making him the very in-let <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the vile and abominable crew in the world, counting all that are pliant to their ungodly humours, the saints of the Most High, and Christ the door and gate through whom they have right to enter; and to whom belong the delicates of the precious things of God, even those which he hath most choicely laid up and reserveth for none but those that unfeignedly turn from iniquity, and walk with him in the newness of the Spirit. Others again do shut up the gates against the godly, labouring with might and main to hinder those that labour to enter, that fain would do it unfeignedly (Matt 23:14; 2 Chron 29:7).[11] Others again do labour all that in them lies to deface the gates, to take away their beauty: like him that took the gold from off the doors and gates of the temple (2 Kings 18:16). Rendering Christ a low and carnal business, &c. But at the measuring-day, at the day when the golden reed shall be the alone rule: then you shall see this city, and her gates discovered in their own glory, holiness, and beauty. For though in our affliction under antichrist, our temple and instruments of worship, with the city, wall, gates, and the like, have been much defaced, even our doctrine of faith and worship, and have been much trod and trampled under the foot of the uncircumcised, yet all shall be recovered and brought into order again by the golden reed of the word of God. Which thing was figured forth to us by the good man Ezra the scribe, who at the restoring of Jerusalem took review of <b>all</b> the <b>things</b> pertaining <b>to</b> the city, both touching its branches and deformity, and also how <b>to</b> set <b>all</b> <b>things</b> in order, and that by the law of God which was in his hand, even according to the writing thereof (Ezra 7:14; 8:34; Neh 8:9). And whosoever doth but read the history of Ezra and Nehemiah throughout, they shall find that by the Word of God they brought <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> pass; <b>all</b> the ordinances of the house and city of God into their right and holy order. And indeed the measuring of the city and of the gates thereof, which is Christ the way, it can be nothing else but a bringing of them by the right understanding and opening of the Word into their proper places and excellencies, both for comers in, and goers out, according to the commandment (Eze 40:4; 43:7-12). For, to speak properly, Christ in his love, grace, merits, and largeness of heart, to let souls into communion with God and all happiness, is in <b>all</b> these <b>things</b> unsearchable, and passing knowledge, being filled with these things beyond thought, and without measure (Eph 3:8,18,19; Col 1:9; John 3:34).|$|R
