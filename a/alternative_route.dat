5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows. This <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> was later named Goodale's Cutoff and part of it is {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E
5|$|Wotton {{station on}} the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Route,</b> which had passed from the {{ownership}} of the Great Central Railway to the London and North Eastern Railway, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the line was abandoned. All buildings of the Brill Tramway station at Wotton were subsequently demolished, other than a small building which had once housed the Tramway's forge, which was left derelict. The bridge that had formerly carried the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Route</b> was demolished in 1970, and the former Great Central Railway {{station on the}} <b>Alternative</b> <b>Route</b> was converted to a private house.|$|E
50|$|Before the BM {{principle}} {{is applied to}} a large traffic network, {{for each of the}} origin-destination (O-D) pairs of the network a set of <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> (paths) should be found.

5|$|Following Watkin's {{retirement}} {{relations between}} the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over the MR from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed the MR. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Route,</b> to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated {{as a part of the}} GCR. A substantial part of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Route,</b> reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging the profitability of the MR.|$|E

5|$|With {{the hostile}} Metropolitan Railway {{controlling}} the GCR's only approach to London through Quainton Road and Aylesbury, GCR General Manager William Pollitt {{decided to create}} a link with the Great Western Railway to create a second route into London which bypassed all MR property. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Route,</b> to link the GWR's existing station at Princes Risborough to the new Great Central line. The line ran from Princes Risborough north to meet the Great Central at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5km) north of Quainton Road, thus bypassing Quainton Road altogether. Although formally an independent company, in practice the new line was operated {{as a part of the}} Great Central Railway. The new route opened in 1906, and a substantial part of the GCR's traffic to and from London was diverted onto the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Route,</b> damaging the profitability of the MR's railway operations.|$|E
5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> of the Oregon Trail.|$|E

5|$|By sea: Banton is {{accessible}} via wooden launches and motorized boats that regularly travel from Lucena City, Quezon. Tourists and visitors {{can also take}} RORO vessels that ply the Manila-Odiongan, Batangas City-Odiongan, or the Roxas-Odiongan route. From Odiongan, Banton {{can be reached by}} jeepney and motorized boat via Calatrava, Romblon. Another RORO route is from Lucena City to Boac or Mogpog in Marinduque. From these towns, travelers can take jeepneys to Buenavista, which is only three hours away from Banton. Another <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> is through Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro by motorized boats.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E

5|$|In 1675, John Ogilby {{noted that}} the main {{coaching}} route from London to Southampton ran {{over the top of}} the down, going directly from Alresford to Twyford, avoiding Winchester. This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, and up to the 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 {{permission}} {{was granted}} to the Morayshire Railway to cross the Spey and join with the Strathspey Railway at Craigellachie. The Morayshire extension and the Strathspey both opened on 1 July 1863 and the Great North provided a service of four trains a day over the line, which gave an <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> between Keith and Elgin. On 30 July 1866 permission {{was given to the}} Morayshire and Great North to amalgamate with agreement, and the loss-making services between Orton and Rothes were withdrawn without notice the following day. It would be August 1881 before the Morayshire became fully part of the Great North.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council have not yet decided {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This has proved to be problematic as the revenue collected from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is not a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of finding good <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> in road networks.

We formally define {{the problem of}} finding <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> with a single via vertex, develop efficient algorithms for it, and evaluate them experimentally. Our algorithms are efficient enough for practical use and compare favorably with previous methods in both speed and solution quality. ...|$|R
