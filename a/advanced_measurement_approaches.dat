40|$|The Basel II accord {{encourages}} {{banks to}} develop their own <b>advanced</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>approaches</b> (AMA). However, the paucity of loss data implies that an individual bank cannot obtain a probability distribution with any reliability. We propose a model, targeting the regulator initially, by obtaining a probability distribution for loss magnitude using pooled annual risk losses from the banks under the regulator’s oversight. We start with summarized loss data from 63 European banks and adjust the probability distribution obtained for losses that go unreported by falling below the threshold level. Using our model, the regulator has a tool for understanding the extent of annual operational losses across all the banks under its supervision. The regulator can use the model on an ongoing basis to make comparisons in year-on-year changes to the operational risk profile of the regulated banking sector. loss model; operational risk; <b>advanced</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>approaches</b> (AMA); Basel II; pooled loss data; Pareto distribution...|$|E

Operational loss databases are typically subject to a minimum recording threshold of roughly $ 10, 000.

40|$|The {{debate on}} {{quantitative}} operational risk modeling has only {{started at the}} beginning of the last decade and the best-practices are still far from being established. Estimation of capital requirements for operational risk under <b>Advanced</b> <b>Measurement</b> <b>Approaches</b> of Basel II is critically dependent on the choice of risk measure, which quantifies the risk exposure based on the underlying simulated distribution of losses. Despite its well-known caveats Value-at-Risk remains a predominant risk measure used in the context of operational risk management. We describe several serious drawbacks of Value-at-Risk and explain why it can possibly lead to misleading conclusions. As a remedy we suggest the use of coherent risk measures - and namely the statistic known as Expected Shortfall - as a suitable alternative or complement for quantification of operational risk exposure. We demonstrate that application of Expected Shortfall in operational loss modeling is feasible and produces reasonable and consistent results. We also consider a variety of statistical techniques for modeling of underlying loss distribution and evaluate extreme value theory framework as the most suitable for this purpose. Using stress tests we further compare the robustness and consistency of selected models and their implied risk capital estimates [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of complex}} and {{sophisticated}} financial instruments, such as derivatives, {{in the modern}} financial environment, has triggered {{the emergence of new}} forms of risks. As well as the need to manage such types of risks, this paper investigates developments which have instigated the Basel Committee in developing advanced risk management techniques such as the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approaches and the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Measurement</b> <b>Approaches</b> (AMA). Developments since the inception of the 1988 Basel Capital Accord have not only led to growing realisation that new forms of risks have emerged, but that previously existing and managed forms require further redress. Basel II has evolved to a form of meta regulation – a type of regulation which involves the risk management of internal risk within firms. This paper attempts to illustrate {{the extent to which the}} Basel II Capital Accord has responded to global and financial developments and concludes on the basis of available research evidence, that given the difficulties attributed to the constantly evolving nature of risk and the need for regulators to remain one step ahead, that Basel II, to an extent, has been responsive in meeting with regulatory demands. However, the existence of unregulated instruments such as hedge funds still implies that, despite its advancements and achievements, the Basel Committee still faces uphill challenges in its efforts to address and regulate risks. ...|$|E
