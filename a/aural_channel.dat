Each student may have a specific way of learning called learning style which may be different from each other's. There are three learning styles which are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning styles according to Oxford in Reid (1995). A visual learner will learn best through visual channel, an auditory learner will learn best through oral and <b>aural</b> <b>channel,</b> and a kinesthetic learner learns best through hands onâ€“approach as they like to move and manipulate objects. In order to achieve the best result of learning, a teacher should provide tasks and activities supporting the students' learning styles. In this study, the writer analyzes the dominant students' learning styles in two classes of a junior high school and the tasks and activities prepared by the teachers. The objective {{of this research is}} to find out whether the teaching strategies used by the teachers accommodate the students' learning styles to achieve the best result of learning. From the findings, the writer finds out that the dominant learning style of the students is the visual learning style. Based on the observation, the writer also finds out that the teachers use various teaching strategies. The teachers use various tasks and activities in their teaching. However, there are more tasks and activities accommodating the auditory learners more than the visual learners...|$|E
40|$|A {{harmonic}} tone complex typically {{evokes a}} sensation of pitch at its fundamental frequency, even without acoustic energy at this frequency. This phenomenon, {{which has been}} shown to be of central neural origin, can be accounted for by a template model in which components of an internally generated harmonic template are optimally matched to transformations of stimulus frequencies. When two or more harmonic tone complexes are simultaneously presented, such as simultaneous playing of musical instruments or vowels from simultaneous speakers, the listener' s task is much more complex. He must first parse the per-ceived spectral components into the correct groups before matching templates to each group. This study presents results of an experimental investigation of constraints on perception of simultaneous complextone pitches imposed by frequency interference within and across <b>aural</b> <b>channels.</b> Our results so far indicate that the only significant constraint is adequate spectral resolution within each ear...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} desire to remain connected when physically distant and computer-mediated communication (CMC) is one means of satisfying this desire. In particular, {{there is a growing}} trend for individuals to use commercially available technology to connect with friends and family in social and leisure settings. Drawing on this trend, performative arts and existing telecommunications research, we identify the social practice of sharing a meal together as ripe for reinterpretation within CMC. We explore the opportunities to design a technology platform that supports remote guests in experiencing togetherness and playfulness within the practices of a traditional dinner party. Through both visual and <b>aural</b> <b>channels</b> as well as remote agency, the dinner guests were able to share a holistic telematic dining experience comparable to a traditional co-presence dinner. Based on the findings, we propose that one must consider the social structure and cultural background of users to inform the design of a technological intervention...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of redundant information in multimedia presentation in history learning. The two modes of multimedia presentation, namely multiple-channel presentation (text + graphics, pictures + redundancy audio, video and animation) and single-channel presentation (text + graphics + pictures) on history learning among deep and surface students were examined. The sample consisted of 240 Form One students from four Malaysian secondary schools. Findings of this study showed that students interacted with the MCP mode obtained significantly higher gain score compared to students interact with the SCP mode. Irrespective of the learning approaches, students using the MCP mode outperformed students using the SCP mode. Apparently, additional redundant information that are relevant to the contents within and across the visual and <b>aural</b> <b>channels</b> provide greater reinforcement in organizing and structuring information issuing in better learning. Results of this study suggest that cognitive load in multimedia-based learning can be minimized if adequate time is provided for comprehension and the pace of learning is under learner control...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, reflections, dispersion, absorption, etc. all {{strongly}} {{alter the}} perceived sound, {{though this is}} not necessarily consciously noticeable for either music or speech, at frequencies above those dominated by room modes. These alterations depend on speaker location(s) with respect to reflecting, dispersing, or absorbing surfaces (including changes in speaker orientation) and on the listening position. In unfortunate situations, a slight movement of any of these, or of the listener, can cause considerable differences. Complex effects, such as stereo (or multiple <b>channel)</b> <b>aural</b> integration into a unified perceived [...] "sound stage" [...] can be lost easily.|$|R

Current research investigating perceptual and cognitive variables is oriented toward determining how children receive and process information and if it is related to academic performance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between learning modality and academic achievement. Learning modality is the ability to receive and process information via specific sensory input channels. The major sensory modes used in learning are visual, <b>aural,</b> and tactile <b>channels.</b> The investigation addressed the following questions: (1) For seventh grade students, is there a relationship between learning modality (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, and Mixed) and Reading Comprehension, Vocabulary, Listening Comprehension, Spelling, Language, Concepts of Numbers, Mathematic Computation, Mathematic Applications, Social Science, Science, Using Information, Total Listening, Total Language, and Total Mathematics when analyzed by sex and IQ? (2) For seventh grade students, is there a relationship between learning modality raw scores and achievement variables when analyzed by sex and IQ?The sample included 188 seventh grade students from two junior high schools in a suburban community northwest of Chicago who had been administered the Swassing-Barbe Modality Index, Stanford Achievement Test, and Otis-Lennon School Ability Test by the district. A three-way ANOVA and correlations were utilized to test the hypotheses at the. 05 level of probability. Based on the findings of this study, it would appear that learning modality is related to academic achievement of seventh grade students in Listening Comprehension; Reading Comprehension and Using Information when analyzed by sex; and Language, Social Science, and Using Information when analyzed by IQ. Learning modality raw score was significantly related to the 14 achievement variables for all subjects. For all average IQ group analyses, no significant relationships occurred. Modality raw score would appear to be more predictive of achievement for above average IQ males, particularly in Language, Mathematics, and Science and for above average IQ females in Mathematics and Spelling. The significant findings of this study indicate a need for further research into learning modality's relationship to achievement at the junior high level. It may be necessary to analyze modality strengths and weaknesses more critically and develop educational programs accordingly...|$|R
