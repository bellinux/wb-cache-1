[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic {{said that the}} song [...] "sounds dated—this is quite clearly {{extended}} mixes from the mid 80's—but that's part of the charm." [...] Dave Barry from The Miami Herald commented that <b>although</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Dance sounds like [...] "old Madonna", [...] "Spotlight" [...] sounds surprisingly fresh to his ears. Joe Brown from The Washington Post commented that the song {{should have been a}} [...] "flat reject". Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "exuberant". Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times commented that [...] " [...] is an attractive package for dance fans—particularly with the inclusion of a new cut, 'Spotlight'". He went on to add that the [...] "lyrics of 'Spotlight' aren't great, but they're still more interesting than the others. Still, the words, like those of most dance songs, are just window dressing that's secondary to the beat. The big attraction of 'Spotlight' is a long, hard-driving, closing passage that's guaranteed to turn dancers on." [...] Jan DeKnock, while writing for Orlando Sentinel, noted that the song was already receiving airplay from radio stations.|$|E

I am a man different from that race of men of whom you are, a wild chief of a wild tribe, having little wisdom; yet I have learned these things--never to break a promise, never to desert a friend, and never to forget a service. Therefore, because I swore fealty to you, because you are my friend, and because you saved my life, I will protect you to the last, though it may well chance that I can do nothing except die for you. For, Queen, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be nought to me while yonder man lives, still I am ready to give my life for you. As for the others I will say this only, that I will not harm them or betray them.|$|E

"But {{the warm}} beams of yon glorious sun can do it," [...] {{continued}} the pastor, pointing upwards as he spoke, [...] "and do it effectually, too; so that, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> scarcely observe the process, it nevertheless turns the hard, thick, solid ice into limpid water at last.

The old man becomes a little child, the wild savage a Christian. But I agree with you in thinking {{that we have not}} been sufficiently alive to the necessity of seeking to convert the Indians before trying to gather them round us. The one would follow as a natural consequence, I think, of the other, and it is owing to this conviction that I intend, as I have already said, to make a journey in spring to visit those who will not or cannot come to visit me. And now, what I want to ask is, whether you will agree to accompany me as steersman and guide on my expedition." ...|$|E
60|$|Kensington Gardens form an eminently {{beautiful}} {{piece of}} artificial woodland and park scenery. The old palace of Kensington, now inhabited by the Duchess of Inverness, stands at one extremity; an edifice of no great mark, built of brick, covering much ground, {{and low in}} proportion to its extent. In front of it, at a considerable distance, there is a sheet of water; and in all directions there are vistas of wide paths among noble trees, standing in groves, or scattered in clumps; everything being laid out with free and generous spaces, {{so that you can}} see long streams of sunshine among the trees, and there is a pervading influence of quiet and remoteness. Tree does not interfere with tree; the art of man is seen conspiring with Nature, as if they had consulted together how to make a beautiful scene, and had taken ages of quiet thought and tender care to accomplish it. We strolled slowly along these paths, and sometimes deviated from them, to walk beneath the trees, many of the leaves of which lay beneath our feet, yellow and brown, and with a pleasant smell of vegetable decay. These were the leaves of chestnut-trees; the other trees (unless elms) have yet, hardly begun to shed their foliage, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> discern a sober change of line in the woodland masses; and the trees individualize themselves by assuming each its own tint, though in a very modest way. If they could have undergone the change of an American autumn, it would have been like putting on a regal robe. Autumn often puts one on in America, but it is apt to be very ragged.|$|E

I guessed what it was by the weight of the case when it came, and thought it best to open it, as it might have got spoilt by rust. It is a timely gift, Sir Gervaise, for the siege has played havoc with the suit Genoa gave you; it is sorely battered, dinted, and broken, and, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> doubtless get it repaired, if I were you I would keep it in its present state as a memorial--and there could be no prouder one--of the part you bore in the siege. I have seen Caretto this morning. He sails for Genoa tomorrow, where he will, I hope, soon recover his strength, for the wounds he received at St. Nicholas have healed but slowly. He said"--and a momentary smile crossed the grand master's face--"that he thought a change might benefit you also, for he was sure that the air here had scarce recovered from the taint of blood. Therefore, here is a paper granting you three months' leave. His commandery is a pleasant one, and well situated on the slopes of the hills; and the fresh air will, doubtless, speedily set you up. I should like nothing better than a stay there myself, but there is much to do to repair the damages caused by the siege, and to place the city in a state of defence should the Turks again lay siege to it; and methinks Mahomet will not sit down quietly under the heavy reverse his troops have met with." ...|$|E

60|$|If {{people were}} {{to accept the}} theory that poetry moves us because of its symbolism, what change should one look for {{in the manner of}} our poetry? A return to the way of our fathers, a casting out of {{descriptions}} of nature for the sake of nature, of the moral law {{for the sake of the}} moral law, a casting out of all anecdotes and of that brooding over scientific opinion that so often extinguished the central flame in Tennyson, and of that vehemence that would make us do or not do certain things; or, in other words, we should come to understand that the beryl stone was enchanted by our fathers that it might unfold the pictures in its heart, and not to mirror our own excited faces, or the boughs waving outside the window. With this change of substance, this return to imagination, this understanding that the laws of art, which are the hidden laws of the world, can alone bind the imagination, would come a change of style, and we would cast out of serious poetry those energetic rhythms, as of a man running, which are the invention of the will with its eyes always on something to be done or undone; and we would seek out those wavering, meditative, organic rhythms, which are the embodiment of the imagination, that neither desires nor hates, because it has done with time, and only wishes to gaze upon some reality, some beauty; nor would it be any longer possible for anybody to deny the importance of form, in all its kinds, for <b>although</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> expound an opinion, or describe a thing when your words are not quite well chosen, you cannot give a body to something that moves beyond the senses, unless your words are as subtle, as complex, as full of mysterious life, as the body of a flower or of a woman. The form of sincere poetry, unlike the form of the popular poetry, may indeed be sometimes obscure, or ungrammatical as in some of the best of the Songs of Innocence and Experience, but it must have the perfections that escape analysis, the subtleties that have a new meaning every day, and it must have all this whether it be but a little song made out of a moment of dreamy indolence, or some great epic made out of the dreams of one poet and of a hundred generations whose hands were never weary of the sword.|$|E
