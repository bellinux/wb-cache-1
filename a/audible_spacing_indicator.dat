40|$|There {{is growing}} {{scientific}} recognition that contact with nature in general, and contact with urban green more specific, {{have the potential}} to positively contribute to human health. For the purpose of developing healthy urban neighbourhoods, this raises the question how to take scientific evidence about these health benefits into account. Accessibility metrics that are well substantiated by empirical evidence are needed. This paper reviews the quantitative and qualitative aspects relevant for accessibility metrics and empirical studies addressing these aspects in relation to health. Studies comparing different types of green <b>space</b> <b>indicators</b> suggest that cumulative opportunities indicators are more consistently positively related to health than residential proximity ones. In contrast to residential proximity indicators, cumulative opportunities indicators take all the green space within a certain distance into account. Comparing results across studies proved to be hard. Green space accessibility was measured {{in a variety of ways}} and the green <b>space</b> <b>indicator</b> that was chosen was often not problematized. We feel that it is time for a more function-oriented approach. How precisely does contact with nature impact health and what type and qualities are relevant in this regard? We think this will lead to a new generation of more evidence-based accessibility metrics that will help to advance the field. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Higher {{education}} (HE) in the UK {{has recently}} suffered financial pressure due to reduced central funding, and {{the requirement to}} widen student access. The estate is typically the second highest revenue expense and is an obvious target for efficiency gains. Sector-wide statistics show there are opportunities for improving efficiency and many influential bodies have advocated space charging {{as a way of}} achieving them. This paper aims to investigate <b>space</b> performance <b>indicators</b> for evidence that space charging improves space use efficiency. Design/methodology/approach The approach used is a statistical analysis of <b>space</b> performance <b>indicators</b> for <b>space</b> charging and other higher education institution (HEIs). Findings Approximately one-quarter of HEIs in the UK operated space charging in 2000 - 2001 but only ten out of 31 space-related performance indicators for the period 1998 - 2001 suggest that increased efficiency results. Scrutiny of the background data shows they predominantly reflect differences in institutional wealth and activities, rather than space use management. Efficiency measures relating space to use provide no evidence of efficiency gains, suggesting that the application of charging as a space management tool is ineffective. Research limitations/implications The methodology does not reveal the reasons for the disparity between theory and results of space charging. Qualitative research into the application of charging systems is required to provide an explanation. Practical implications The conclusions are important for HE managers who are considering implementing expensive systems to improve space efficiency. The results also shed light on the usefulness of <b>space</b> performance <b>indicators</b> for HE estates. Originality/value Although there have been many assertions that space charging will improve space use efficiency in the HE sector, this research provides evidence to the contrary...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Populations show spatial-temporal {{fluctuations}} in abundance, {{partly due to}} random processes and partly due to self-regulatory processes. We evaluated the effects of various external factors on the population numerical abundance of curimba Prochilodus lineatus in the upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil, over a 19 -year period. Panel data analysis was applied to examine the structure of temporal and spatial abundance while controlling auto-regressive processes and spatial non-homogeneity variances that often obscure relationships. As sources of population variation, we considered predation, competition, selected abiotic variables, construction of a dam upstream of the study area, water level and flood intensity during the spawning period. We found that biological interactions (predation and competition) were not significantly related to variations in curimba abundance; specific conductance was a <b>space</b> <b>indicator</b> of abundance, apparently linked to the biology of the species; intensity of floods determined inter-annual variation in abundances; Porto Primavera Dam negatively impacted the abundances at sites in the floodplain directly affected by discharges from the dam. Panel data analysis was a powerful tool that identified the need for intense flooding to maintain high abundances of curimba in the upper Paraná River. We believe our results apply to other species with similar life strategy...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to increase}} the academic debate on which indicators and approaches capture more appropriately the phenomenon of economic clustering (see, for instance, Arbia & Piras, 2007). A composite measure is proposed combining discrete and continuous <b>space</b> <b>indicators</b> {{in order to identify}} spatial localization more effectively as proposed by several authors such as Arbia (2001), Guillain and Le Gallo (2007), and Sohn (2004). The paper is devoted to unfolding the localization patterns of employment within three-digit manufacturing industries by Italian provinces in 2007 employing the location quotient, the locational Gini, the global Moran’s I, and the local indicator of spatial associations since they provide complementary information (see, for instance, Guillain & Le Gallo, 2007). Evidence shows that the manufacture of military fighting vehicles has the highest localization with almost full concentration; whereas the industry of other general-purpose machinery holds the highest global Moran’s I. Moreover, the five three-digit industries within the two-digit manufacture of machinery and equipment n. e. c. show a relatively high global autocorrelation and concentration.

Mixtures of the cholate extracts and soy asolectin were subjected to gel filtration to remove the detergent. The reconstituted vesicles were frozen, thawed, and sonicated in a buffer that contained 10 millimolar d-glycerate and, usually, [3 H]sucrose as an internal <b>space</b> <b>indicator.</b> The dilution of the vesicles into a medium that contained 0. 4 millimolar [14 C]d-glycerate resulted in a rapid accumulation of labeled glycerate, followed by a much slower loss of [14 C]d-glycerate from the vesicles. This behavior is characteristic of counterflow. The accumulation of [14 C]d-glycerate was strongly inhibited by HgCl 2, which blocks glycolate/glycerate transport in intact chloroplasts. In the absence of proton ionophores, the extent of [14 C]glycolate accumulation under similar conditions was much {{greater than that of}} [14 C]d-glycerate. External glycolate inhibited d-glycerate counterflow and external d-glycerate inhibited glycolate counterflow. The external pH dependence of the efflux of [14 C]d-glycerate accumulated in vesicles by counterflow and its inhibition by external l-mandelate are characteristics displayed by glycolate transport in intact chloroplasts. Partial purification of the transporter was achieved by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The solubilized glycolate and glycerate counterflow activities, assayed by reconstitution into vesicles, were found to sediment similarly...|$|R

40|$|When I started {{studying}} Romania’s {{rural areas}} I {{was happy to}} find out among others that “the village” has not lost ground but continues as a topic of interest for specialists. The Romanian village has regained importance due {{to a change in}} the mind-set of a population segment that has come to regard the rural environment as an attractive place to live in. Consequently, a new type of migration occurred, i. e. urban-rural migration, which co-existed with the rural exodus up to 1996 and gained momentum after 2002. The new rural residents seek the same extent of housing comfort they enjoyed before moving to permanently live in the country, plus the other advantages of living in less polluted environments, with larger dwelling areas. For a clearer picture of the quality of rural housing we aim to assess the public utility infrastructure quality and the population’s access to utilities by determining the density of the sewerage, drinking water and natural gas networks and by inventorying the dwelling installations (for sewerage and the supply of drinking water, electric power, thermal energy).

Methods Three different <b>indicators</b> of green <b>space</b> coverage were derived for a set of 268 small areas in four cities within Britain. The indicators had different origins and provided a spectrum of sensitivity from larger spaces only, through to ambient greenery. Two indicators reproducible for anywhere in Europe were included. Agreement between the indicators on the quantity of green space in a small area, and their independent association with measures of mortality and self-reported morbidity, were compared. Results Overall, the indicators showed relatively close overall agreement (all r 2 &# 62; 0. 89, p&# 60; 0. 001). However, agreement varied by level of area socioeconomic deprivation (p&# 60; 0. 001). The indicator that detected larger spaces only found less green space in areas of socioeconomic deprivation than the other two. Despite this difference, all indicators showed similar protective associations with the risk of mortality and self-reported morbidity suggesting that larger green spaces may be more important for health effects than smaller spaces. Conclusions Associations between green <b>space</b> <b>indicator</b> and health were not sensitive to indicator origin and type. This raises the possibility of trans-European epidemiological studies.
