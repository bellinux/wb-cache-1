50|$|The <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> <b>{{condition}}</b> is {{a condition}} that must be fulfilled by a lens or other optical system in order for it to produce sharp images of off-axis as well as on-axis objects. It was formulated by Ernst Abbe {{in the context of}} microscopes.|$|E
50|$|If rays issuing from O (fig. 1) be concurrent, it {{does not}} follow that points in a portion of a plane {{perpendicular}} at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small. With a considerable aperture, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to <b>Abbe,</b> the <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called aplanatic (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering). This word was first used by Robert Blair (d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration. Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{complete}} spherical {{concentration of}} light the maximum theoretically possible {{total energy density}} for a given power input can be, in principle, achieved by appropriate choice of polarization and angular amplitude variation. Illumination of a focusing system with a plane-polarized wave creates at the focus equal electric and magnetic energy densities. By appropriate choice of radial variation this energy density can be maximized. For hemispherical concentration the electric energy density can be seven sixteenths of the maximum possible for a given power input, and the total energy density can be seven eighths of the maximum possible. Focusing by optical systems satisfying the <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> amongst others is also considered. For a system satisfying the <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> the total energy density can be is of the maximum possible. ...|$|R

The <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> theorem in the nineteenth century is shown to lead to a number of aspheric aplanatic objectives in which this theorem is fulfilled. The Schmidt telescope, an astigmatic system of high performance is considered briefly in conjunction with some variations of it. Part II. The Schmidt camera is considered in more detail, including descriptions of a number of author's' methods for deriving the equation of the corrector plate, and the possibilities in balancing the aberrations over the whole field. A number of the Schmidt variations are described including field flattened and folded types. Part III. The de signs of two mirror and more complicated mirror pate systems are analysed by first order and other methods, and the use of aspheric surfaces to provide field correctors for large paraboloid mirrors described.

5000|$|Loss of {{the high}} (spatial) {{frequency}} content causes blurring and loss of sharpness (see discussion related to point spread function). Bandwidth truncation causes a (fictitious, mathematical, ideal) point source in the object plane to be blurred (or, spread out) in the image plane, giving rise to the term, [...] "point spread function." [...] Whenever bandwidth is expanded or contracted, image size is typically contracted or expanded accordingly, {{in such a way}} that the space-bandwidth product remains constant, by Heisenberg's principle (Scott 1998 and <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> <b>condition).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{approximation}} holds {{when the}} numerical aperture is small, {{but it turns}} out that for well-corrected optical systems such as camera lenses, a more detailed analysis shows that [...] is almost exactly equal to [...] even at large numerical apertures.

The tangent would, of course, be correct if the principal planes were really plane. However, the complete theory of the <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> shows that if a lens is corrected for coma and spherical aberration, as all good photographic objectives must be, the second principal plane becomes a portion of a sphere of radius [...] centered about the focal point". In this sense, the traditional thin-lens definition and illustration of f-number is misleading, and defining it in terms of numerical aperture may be more meaningful.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the {{converging}} (partial) {{spherical wave}} {{shown in the}} figure above produces an Airy disc in the image plane. The argument of the Airy function is important, because this determines the scaling of the Airy disc (in other words, how big the disc is in the image plane). If Θmax is the maximum angle that the converging waves make with the lens axis, r is radial distance in the image plane, and wavenumber k = 2π/λ where λ = wavelength, then the argument of the Airy function is: kr tan(Θmax). If Θmax is small (only {{a small portion of}} the converging spherical wave is available to form the image), then radial distance, r, has to be very large before the total argument of the Airy function moves away from the central spot. In other words, if Θmax is small, the Airy disc is large (which is just another statement of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for FT pairs, namely that small extent in one domain corresponds to wide extent in the other domain, and the two are related via the space-bandwidth product). By virtue of this, high magnification systems, which typically have small values of Θmax (by the <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> <b>condition),</b> can have more blur in the image, owing to the broader PSF. The size of the PSF is proportional to the magnification, so that the blur is no worse in a relative sense, but it is definitely worse in an absolute sense.|$|E

40|$|Most studies {{tackling}} hysteresis identification in {{the technical}} literature follow white-box approaches, i. e. they rely {{on the assumption that}} measured data obey a specific hysteretic model. Such an assumption may be a hard requirement to handle in real applications, since hysteresis is a highly individualistic nonlinear behaviour. The present paper adopts a black-box approach based on nonlinear state-space models to identify hysteresis dynamics. This approach is shown to provide a general framework to hysteresis identification, featuring flexibility and parsimony of representation. Nonlinear model terms are constructed as a multivariate polynomial in the state variables, and parameter estimation is performed by minimising weighted least-squares cost functions. Technical issues, including the selection of the model order and the polynomial degree, are discussed, and model validation is achieved in both broadband and <b>sine</b> <b>conditions.</b> The study is carried out numerically by exploiting synthetic data generated via the Bouc-Wen equations.

He also perfected the interference method by Fizeau, in 1884. Abbe, Zeiss, Zeiss' son, Roderich Zeiss, and Otto Schott formed, in 1884, Jenaer Glaswerk Schott & Genossen. This company, which in time would in essence merge with Zeiss Optical Works, was responsible for research and production of 44 initial types of optical glass. Working with telescopes, he built image reversal system in 1895. In order to produce high quality objectives, Abbe made significant contributions to the diagnosis and correction of optical aberrations, both spherical aberration and coma aberration, which is required for an objective to reach the resolution limit of [...] In addition to spherical aberration, Abbe discovered that the rays in optical systems must have constant angular magnification over their angular distribution to produce a diffraction limited spot, a principle known as the <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> <b>condition.</b> So monumental and advanced were Abbe's calculations and achievements that Frits Zernike based his phase contrast work that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953, and Hans Busch used them to work on the development of the electron microscope.|$|E
40|$|In {{designing}} imaging optical systems, {{the primary}} {{task is to}} correct aberrations. Aberrations are deviations from perfect imagery. They depend on both the filed size and pupil position. When the Constant Optical Path Length (OPL) condition is satisfied, an optical system is free of all orders of spherical aberrations, which have zero field dependence. When the <b>Abbe</b> <b>Sine</b> <b>condition</b> is satisfied, all the aberrations with linear filed dependence are corrected. The <b>Abbe</b> <b>Sine</b> <b>condition</b> does not involve any off-axis ray properties, but it predicts the correction of off-axis aberrations. We go one step beyond the Constant OPL condition and the <b>Abbe</b> <b>Sine</b> <b>condition.</b> By using Hamilton's characteristic functions, we developed a set of criteria for correcting the aberrations with quadratic field dependence and all orders of pupil dependence. These criteria involve only properties of the rays originating from the on-axis object point as the <b>Abbe</b> <b>Sine</b> <b>condition</b> does. Using these criteria, we analyzed some known designs and obtained new information about these designs. We also developed an algorithm to implement the criteria in designing well-corrected novel optical systems. Even when the criteria are not exactly satisfied, {{we now have a}} way to predict the residual quadratic field-dependent aberrations without tracing rays from any off-axis object point. We extended the Hamiltonian treatment to bilateral systems and developed similar criteria for correcting the quadratic field-dependent aberrations for this type of system...|$|E

40|$|In {{so-called}} compact two-mirror focusing and afocal systems {{the secondary}} mirror is {{situated at the}} paraxial focus of the spherical primary mirror. The peculiar conelike shape of the secondary is chosen to eliminate the spherical aberration. Thus the systems are stigmatic, {{but they have a}} great offence against the <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> (OSC), creating uneven distribution of energy {{on the surface of the}} outgoing wavefront. There is a substantial concentration of energy toward the optical axis, similar to apodization of the pupil. Calculations of the point spread function (PSF) show that in such systems, the Airy disk is slightly enlarged (at most 20 %) and the second maximum (the first bright ring) can be completely suppressed. The most effective suppression of the second and higher maxima in the diffraction pattern is obtained with an imposed central obscuration ratio of 0. 5 and a primary mirror focal ratio of 2. Compact two-mirror afocal and focusing systems have intrinsic apodization, enabling modification of the diffraction pattern without the use of a variable transmission filter or coating at the pupil.

50|$|The {{condition}} for the reproduction of a surface element {{in the place of}} a sharply reproduced point — the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors. E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> for several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were aplanatic for several colors; such systems he termed apochromatic. While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification. This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (compensating oculars), so that it is eliminated {{in the image of the}} whole microscope. The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do. The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.|$|R

Experiment 1 varied envelope cutoff frequency (30 and 300 Hz), carrier type (sine and noise), and number of bands (2 – 5) for vocoded speech presented to normal-hearing listeners. Performance was better with a high cutoff for sine-vocoding, with no effect of cutoff for noise-vocoding. With a low cutoff, performance was better for noise-vocoding than for sine-vocoding. With a high cutoff, performance was better for sine-vocoding. Experiment 2 measured perceptibility of cues to voice pitch variations. A noise carrier combined with a high cutoff allowed intonation to be perceived to some degree but performance was best in high-cutoff <b>sine</b> <b>conditions.</b> A low cutoff led to poorest performance, regardless of carrier. Experiment 3 tested the relative contributions of comodulation across bands and spectral density to improved performance with a sine carrier and high cutoff. Comodulation across bands had no effect so it appears that sidebands providing a denser spectrum improved performance. These results indicate that carrier type in combination with envelope cutoff can alter the available cues in vocoded speech, factors which must be considered in interpreting results with vocoded signals...|$|R

40|$|Rather than {{measuring}} aberrations {{at several}} locations {{across the field}} to quantify the alignment of an optical system, we show how a simple measurement of the pupil mapping {{can be used to}} measure the off-axis performance of the system. This method uses the <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> <b>condition</b> to relate the mapping between the entrance and the exit pupils, where the violations of the generalized sine condition are used to determine the pupil mapping error. From this pupil mapping, the linearly field-dependent aberrations can be calculated. One of the advantages to this method is that all of the test equipment can be aligned {{to the center of the}} field while making measurements of the off-axis performance, which reduces the uncertainty of the measurement. This advantage is particularly evident with systems or sub-systems that have large inherent aberrations where off-axis alignment tolerances are very tight. Additionally, in the Sine Condition Test (SCTest), the test equipment can be designed to compensate for the native Siedel coma in the system. This makes it more straightforward to measure the linearly field dependence of the aberrations. By reducing or removing coma, the measurement uncertainty is further reduced. This work begins by explaining the background of the <b>Abbe</b> <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> derivation of the pupil mapping error, and an overview of linearly field-dependent astigmatism that arises from misalignment. Next, the general method of implementation is discussed, and expanded further by exploring the two different source options: a point source with a grating or a flat-panel display. Experimental results from proof of concept systems are shown for both cases. Next, this dissertation explains how the SCTest can be implemented on more complex systems. Last, this dissertation shows how the linear aberrations, along with constant field-dependent aberrations, can be used to align a system. Here, the application of the alignment version of the SCTest on a three mirror anastigmat (TMA) is discussed. Using simulation, this dissertation then investigates the behavior of the alignment SCTest for various levels of mirror misalignment, mirror fabrication errors, and misalignment of the test equipment. All of these tests show that the alignment SCTest can successfully align an optical system...|$|E

In the present study, we investigated whether correlating changes in disparity and loudness would provide a functional advantage in binding disparity and sound amplitude in a visual search paradigm. To test this hypothesis, we used a method {{similar to that used}} by van der Burg et al. to show that non-spatial transient (square-wave) modulations of loudness can drastically improve spatial visual search for a correlated luminance modulation. We used dynamic random-dot stereogram displays to produce pure disparity modulations. Target and distractors were small disparity-defined squares (either 6 or 10 in total). Each square moved back and forth in depth in front of the background plane at different phases. The target’s depth modulation was synchronized with an amplitude-modulated auditory tone. Visual and auditory modulations were always congruent (both sine-wave or square-wave). In a speeded search task, five observers were asked to identify the target as quickly as possible. Results show a significant improvement in visual search times in the square-wave condition compared to the <b>sine</b> <b>condition,</b> suggesting that transient auditory information can efficiently drive visual search in the disparity domain. In a second experiment, participants performed the same task in the absence of sound and showed a clear set-size effect in both modulation conditions.
