5|$|Barrett {{is married}} to Stephanie and they have two children, Grace and Andrew (born November 2007). His cousin, Scott Fletcher, also played for the Cubs, {{along with many other}} teams over his fifteen-year career. Barrett has spent a {{considerable}} portion of his personal life devoted to helping children. He runs several youth baseball programs, including one in Hawaii, which was inspired from his tenure with the Hawaiian Winter Baseball League. He also works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Cubs Care Program to help lesser fortunate and sick children. More recently, he has worked with Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster to raise money to help Derrek Lee's daughter and research for Leber's congenital <b>amaurosis.</b> Michael Barrett donated $50,000 to Project 3000 and pledged an additional sum of money for every home run he hits. Barrett was also a regular guest on FOX Chicago's The Final Word television show, which is co hosted by Tom Waddle, a former Chicago Bears wide receiver.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, three {{independent}} research groups reported {{that patients with}} the rare genetic retinal disease Leber's congenital <b>amaurosis</b> had been successfully treated using gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV).|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{technique}} is electro-physiologic testing using visual evoked (cortical) potentials (VEPs or VECPs), {{which can be}} used to estimate visual acuity in doubtful cases and expected severe vision loss cases like Leber's congenital <b>amaurosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|To date, AAV vectors {{have been}} used in over 117 {{clinical}} trials worldwide, approximately 5.6% of virus-vectored gene-therapy trials. Recently, promising results have been obtained from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for a number of diseases, including Leber's congenital <b>amaurosis,</b> Hemophilia, congestive heart failure, spinal muscular atrophy, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Early {{clinical}} failures led to dismissals of gene therapy. Clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention, although as of 2014, it {{was still}} largely an experimental technique. These include treatment of retinal diseases Leber's congenital <b>amaurosis</b> and choroideremia, X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID, adrenoleukodystrophy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, haemophilia, and Parkinson's disease. Between 2013 and April 2014, US companies invested over $600 million in the field.|$|E
25|$|Leber's {{congenital}} <b>amaurosis</b> is {{an inherited}} blinding disease caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. The {{results of a}} small clinical trial in children were published in April. Delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying RPE65 yielded positive results. In May two more groups reported positive results in independent clinical trials using gene therapy to treat the condition. In all three clinical trials, patients recovered functional vision without apparent side-effects.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as <b>amaurosis</b> fugax). Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E
500|$|Born blind due to Leber's {{congenital}} <b>amaurosis</b> (which {{causes the}} retina to disintegrate), Tan grew {{up listening to}} 1980s Mandopop ballads, which inspired him to learn to play the piano and guitar. He studied at the Singapore School for the Visually Handicapped and Dunearn Secondary School. After his O Levels, he worked as a massage therapist and a singer at a café. He also busked at Jurong East and Waterloo Street, playing his guitar and singing Mandopop ballads for two to eight hours per day. According to The New Paper reporter Mindy Tan, his performances drew large crowds (including Malays and Indians), some of whom were so [...] "impressed [...] his music" [...] that they would [...] "sit on the pavement nearby for up to an hour listening to him".|$|E
2500|$|On October 8, 1862, Jones was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} colonel and transferred to the 154th New York Volunteers, or the [...] "Hardtack regiment", then under command by his former law partner Colonel Addison Rice. Rice had founded the regiment and, within two months of its arrival in Northern Virginia, he turned over his command to Jones. The 154th was part of General Oliver O. Howard's XI Corps during the Battle of Chancellorsville, attached to the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Division commanded by Brigadier General Adolph von Steinwehr, where Jones was wounded in the right hip when his unit was ambushed and overrun by Confederate troops under Thomas [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson resulting in his capture. Jones remained a prisoner-of-war for five months until being released in a prisoner exchange in October 1863; other accounts claim he was paroled for medical reasons [...] on May 15 and again hospitalized in Washington during June where had an attack of <b>amaurosis</b> two months later. After his release from hospital in Anapolis, Maryland, Jones was placed in charge of paroled prisoners before returning to active duty [...] and accompanied the XI Corps upon being transferred to Tennessee. The unit was present at Chattanooga during the assault on Missionary Ridge the next month, however they did not participate in the battle.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{cases are}} taken from an able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick, and from Dr. Prosper Lucas. (12/19. 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' April 1861 pages 482-6; 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 1 pages 391-408.) <b>Amaurosis,</b> either congenital or coming on late in life, and causing total blindness, is often inherited; {{it has been observed}} in three successive generations. Congenital absence of the iris has likewise been transmitted for three generations, a cleft-iris for four generations, being limited in this latter case to the males of the family. Opacity of the cornea and congenital smallness of the eyes have been inherited. Portal records a curious case, in which a father and two sons were rendered blind, whenever the head was bent downwards, apparently owing to the crystalline lens, with its capsule, slipping through an unusually large pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye. Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright light, is inherited, as is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see except under a strong light: a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of this latter defect having affected eighty-five members of the same family during six generations. The singular incapacity of distinguishing colours, which has been called DALTONISM, is notoriously hereditary, and has been traced through five generations, in which it was confined to the female sex.|$|E
6000|$|The {{organs of}} sight and hearing are {{generally}} admitted to be homologous {{with one another and}} with various dermal appendages; hence these parts are liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction. Mr. White Cowper says [...] "that in all cases of double microphthalmia brought under his notice he has at the same time met with defective development of the dental system." [...] Certain forms of blindness seem {{to be associated with the}} colour of the hair; a man with black hair and a woman with light-coloured hair, both of sound constitution, married and had nine children, all of whom were born blind; of these children, five [...] "with dark hair and brown iris were afflicted with amaurosis; the four others, with light-coloured hair and blue iris, had <b>amaurosis</b> and cataract conjoined." [...] Several cases could be given, showing that some relation exists between various affections of the eyes and ears; thus Liebreich states that out of 241 deaf-mutes in Berlin, no less than fourteen suffered from the rare disease called pigmentary retinitis. Mr. White Cowper and Dr. Earle have remarked that inability to distinguish different colours, or colour-blindness, [...] "is often associated with a corresponding inability to distinguish musical sounds." [...] (25/23. These statements are taken from Mr. Sedgwick in the 'Medico-Chirurg. Review' July 1861 page 198; April 1863 pages 455 and 458. Liebreich is quoted by Professor Devay in his 'Mariages Consanguins' 1862 page 116.) ...|$|E
6000|$|What is Justice? that, on the whole, is the {{question}} of the Sphinx to us. The law of Fact is, that Justice must and will be done. The sooner the better; for the Time grows stringent, frightfully pressing! [...] "What is Justice?" [...] ask many, to whom cruel Fact alone will be able to prove responsive. It is like jesting Pilate asking, What is Truth? Jesting Pilate had not the smallest chance to ascertain what was Truth. He could not have known it, had a god shown it to him. Thick serene opacity, thicker than <b>amaurosis,</b> veiled those smiling eyes of his to Truth; the inner retina of them was gone paralytic, dead. He looked at Truth; and discerned her not, there where she stood. [...] "What is Justice?" [...] The clothed embodied Justice that sits in Westminster Hall, with penalties, parchments, tipstaves, is very visible. But the unembodied Justice, whereof that other is either an emblem, or else is a fearful indescribability, is not so visible! For the unembodied Justice is of Heaven; a Spirit, and Divinity of Heaven,--invisible to all but the noble and pure of soul. The impure ignoble gaze with eyes, and she is not there. They will prove it to you by logic, by endless Hansard Debatings, by bursts of Parliamentary eloquence. It is not consolatory to behold! For properly, as many men as there are in a Nation who can withal see Heaven's invisible Justice, and know it to be on Earth also omnipotent, so many men are there who stand between a Nation and perdition. So many, and no more. Heavy-laden England, how many hast thou in this hour?
