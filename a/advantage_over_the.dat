5|$|As {{a result}} of the Sino-Soviet split, {{tensions}} along the Chinese–Soviet border reached their peak in 1969, and United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War. The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Soviets as well.|$|E
5|$|Damascus {{subsequently}} {{became the}} capital of the Ummayad Caliphate and all of the surplus revenue of the Ummayad Caliphate's provinces were forwarded to the treasury of Damascus. Arabic was also established as the official language, giving the Arab minority of the city an <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Greek-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May, the {{situation}} in the newly declared State of Israel and the remnants of Palestine was chaotic with the British leaving.

5|$|The {{two teams}} {{proceeded}} to trade possessions, with no side {{able to gain}} an <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other's defense. Tech received the kickoff from Georgia, but was again hampered by penalties after earning a first down. After the Virginia Tech punt, Georgia went three-and-out, punting to the Hokies, who also went three-and-out.|$|E
5|$|When {{firing the}} same shell, the 16-inch/45 Mark 6 {{had a slight}} <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 16-inch/50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor—a shell from a 45cal gun would be slower, meaning {{that it would have}} a steeper {{trajectory}} as it descended. At , a shell from a 45cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45.2degrees, as opposed to 36degrees with the 50cal.|$|E

5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E

Guilty Gear X Plus adds three unlockable characters: Justice and Kliff Undersn, who return from the first game, and Robo-Ky, an alternate version of Ky Kiske. The Plus edition allows a player to unlock gold versions of each character, who possesses a special <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> regular version.|$|E
5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rest of the group.

5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not {{withdraw}} to North Vietnam {{during the rainy}} season. Previously during the conflict, air mobility by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with an <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. This advantage was {{now going to be}} overcome by road improvement and the prepositioning of supplies which allowed the communists to maintain year-round use of their lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{accepted}} his blindfold with relief and was led {{back to his}} ship. Phips' council of war was extremely vexed by the reply, having expected to fall upon a defenseless and panicked city. That evening drums and fifes were heard approaching Quebec, followed by heavy cheering from the town: Louis-Hector de Callière had arrived with the remaining Montreal militia, giving Frontenac a numerical <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> New Englanders.|$|E
5|$|The South Dakotas {{were able}} to reap the {{benefits}} of developments in radar technology during World War 2. By the end of the war, the ships were equipped with air and surface-search radars and radar fire-control. When commissioned, the ships were equipped with the SC air-search radar. This radar would eventually get replaced by the SK and SK-2 air-search radar. The main battery directors were fitted with Mark 3 fire-control radar, which were replaced by the Mark 8 starting in 1942. This radar gave these ships a significant <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Japanese, which for the most part relied on optical systems.|$|E

5|$|The shootdown {{happened}} {{at a very}} tense time in U.S.–Soviet relations during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing {{a substantial amount of}} hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that the plane had merely been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets, and that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E
5|$|With four {{defensive}} starters {{out with}} injuries, the Buccaneers spotted the Cincinnati Bengals a 14–0 first-quarter lead. The defense came {{together for the}} last three quarters, with the only points coming from Tommy Casanova’s 25-yard fumble return for a touchdown. Ken Anderson, the AFC’s leading passer, was held to 98 yards passing. Lacking healthy linebackers, the Buccaneers abandoned their 3–4 defense in favor of a 4–3. The Buccaneers held a 191–174 yardage <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> AFC Central-leading Bengals in the final 45 minutes. The Bengals declined to hand out game balls to any of their players after the win.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the summit, Romain Bardet attacked, {{and the bottom}} had gained a twenty-second <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> front group of around thirty riders, {{increasing}} it to one minute {{at the foot of}} the Pra-Loup climb. Sky again controlled the head of the chase, with Vincenzo Nibali, Alejandro Valverde and Wilco Kelderman the notable riders distanced. Chris Froome launched an attack in the final , with Tejay van Garderen and Beñat Intxausti following. Van Garderen dropped Intxausti and passed Froome to take second place, thirty-six seconds behind stage winner Bardet. The new leaders in the classifications were Van Garderen in the general, Bardet in the young riders' and Sky in the team standings.|$|E

5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> peloton and were soon caught. There were no {{lead-out}} trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the move}} to Newark, the Devils hired their 14th coach in a 26-season span, Brent Sutter. As the Devils' {{pre-season}} came to an end, prospects Nicklas Bergfors and David Clarkson made the final roster. The Devils opened their new arena, the Prudential Center, on October 27, 2007, against Ottawa after opening {{the season with a}} nine-game road trip. The game ended with a 4–1 win for Ottawa. In the last game of the 2007–08 season against the Rangers, the Devils won in a shootout, giving them home ice <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Rangers in the playoffs. The Devils lost the series against the Rangers 4–1, losing all three games at home. Brodeur won the Vezina Trophy for the fourth time in five years for his performance in the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One <b>advantage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E
