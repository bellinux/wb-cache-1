5|$|The {{results of}} {{prospective}} cohort {{studies on the}} relationship between <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> breast cancer have been consistently negative.

5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> post-abortion care.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explored}} {{reproductive health}} care in rural Washington State, reasons given by providers for not offering <b>abortions,</b> <b>and</b> providers' willingness to use medical abortifacients.
