40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} the main properties of the legal judgment in a private law - <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> and enforcement. The {{focus is on the}} accurate analysis of the traditional institutions of the private process. It is not examined only {{from the point of view}} of the valid legal regulation but also according to the reasoning of the legal theory and from the conclusions of the legal practice. Theoretical interpretation is often supported by practical examples that are used to improve the intelligibility of the thesis and understandability of individual problems. The diploma thesis is mainly focused on the issue of the <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> of judgment. In relation with that there is explained the essence and purpose of this institution. <b>Legal</b> <b>effect</b> is conceived as the set of the specific properties (impacts), that the judgment acquires when the legal presumptions are fulfilled. There are defined the concepts of the formal and material <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> including their mutual relation. Attention is also given to the individual impacts of the <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> as the finality, the immutability and the obligation of the judgment. There is described not only its legal nature but also the specific utterances and consequences of its application. Following interpretation of bounds of the <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> tries [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{so-called}} merger clauses while drafting contracts {{governed by the}} civil law is becoming increasingly popular. Since merger clauses originated from the common law, {{it is not easy}} to ascertain their <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> under the civil law. This is also the case in Polish law. Not only is there little mention in the legal literature of the effects of merger clauses, but also legal scholars' views on the issue differ widely. This article tries to answer the question of what the <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of using merger clauses under Polish law are. Among others, it tackles the important issue of how a merger clause inserted into a contract influences the process of its interpretation and closing its loopholes. Moreover, it attempts to compare merger clauses' <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> under Polish law and European private law model rules. The starting point of the analysis performed in the paper is the distinction between two functions of contractual clauses, which leads to a clearer description of the consequences of merger clauses' usage. The adoption of the aforementioned distinction leads to the conclusion that the <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of merger clauses under Polish law may be far more significant than is often considered. Additionally, it can be observed that these effects do not differ from the <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of merger clauses under European law model rules as much as has been claimed...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the problem of {{correlation}} of unilateral acts of states and the principle of estoppel. Scholars often advert to estoppel to support the binding force of unilateral acts of states. Some writers suppose that the minimum <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> of any unilateral act is to create an estoppel, others contend that estoppel becomes absolutely superfluous when it is used to confirm the <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> of uni-lateral declarations. Vital elements of the given institutions are examined and the conclusion is made that the scope of estoppel in the light of unilateral state acts is rather limited. When all the requirements are met, estoppel, indeed, may stand as a <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> of unilateral act. However, it seems unnecessary to advert to estoppel for the purpose of substantiation of unilateral acts of states binding force...|$|R
