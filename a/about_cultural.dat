5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E

25|$|The 18th century Commonwealth {{suffered}} {{from a series of}} incompetent kings of foreign origin whose main interest was fighting personal wars against other countries. Persistent wars and general turmoil bankrupted the national finances, and many power-hungry Magnates cooperated with foreign forces. The last king, Poniatowski, was paid by Catherine II of Russia and was obliged to report to Russian ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. He was furthermore richly paid to facilitate the constitution of May 3, 1791 but because of his character or rather lack of it, he did not fulfill his promise. On the other hand, Poniatowski did care <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> life in Poland, supported necessary education of young patriots and also did not go against members of the Bar confederation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} types of stories among many {{indigenous}} communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve {{as a means to}} exchange information. These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> values and lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are often told {{the story of a young}} man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} the Youth Olympic Games came from Austrian {{industrial}} manager Johann Rosenzopf in 1998. [...] This {{was in response to}} growing global concerns about childhood obesity and the dropping participation of youth in sport activities, especially amongst youth in developed nations. [...] It was further recognized that a youth version of the Olympic Games would help foster participations in the Olympic Games. [...] Despite these reasons for having an Olympic event for young people, the IOC's response of holding a purely sporting event was negative. [...] IOC delegates wanted the event to be as much <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> education and exchange as it was about sports, which is why the Culture and Education Program (CEP) was developed as a component of each celebration of the Games. [...] Jacques Rogge, IOC President, formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007. [...] There are several goals for the YOG, and four of them include bringing together the world's best young athletes, offering an introduction into Olympism, innovating in educating and debating Olympic values. [...] The city of Singapore was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008.

500|$|Indeed, {{there is}} a strong Darwinian {{undercurrent}} framing the representation of race in She, stemming from Haggard's own interest in evolutionary theory and archaeological history. In particular the theme of racial degeneration is a prominent aspect in the novel. Moving into the fin de siècle, late-Victorians were increasingly concerned <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> and national decline resulting from racial decay. In She, this evolutionary concept of degeneration is manifested in Ayesha and the Amahagger. Haggard represents the Amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities, [...] "a curious mingling of races", originally descended from the inhabitants of Kôr but having intermarried with Arabs and Africans. Racial hybridisation of any kind [...] "entailed degeneration" [...] to Victorians, a [...] "decline from the pure blood" [...] of the initial races, and thus [...] "an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the Amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their Kôr ancestors may have imparted to them". Thus, Ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired: [...] "for Arabian am I by birth, even 'al Arab al Ariba' (an Arab of the Arabs), and of the race of our father Yárab, the son of Khâtan of the true Arab blood". However, the novel's starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of Ayesha. Stepping into the Pillar of Fire, the immortal She begins to wither and decay, undergoing as death what Judith Wilt describes as the [...] "ultimate Darwinian nightmare", evolution in reverse.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1935, Smochină {{launched}} a new periodical, titled Moldova Nouă ("New Moldavia"). Its opening manifesto, expressing a program of the Cultural Association of Transnistrians, promised to provide the Romanian public with a [...] "generic culture" [...] on the Moldavian life in Soviet lands, and to follow the principles of [...] "objectivity, scientific truth [...] the national idea". This multilingual review, put out by an editorial headquarters in Iași and the Brawo printing press of Bucharest, only survived until 1936. Before closing down, the review had featured his essay Republica Moldovenească a Sovietelor ("The Moldavian Republic of Soviets"), later published by Cartea Românească as a volume. In 1935, also with Moldova Nouă, Smochină released his French-language study Les Moldaves de Russie Soviétique ("The Moldavians of Soviet Russia"), illustrated with samples of Romanian folklore from the region—songs <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> isolation {{and the impact of}} Russification. He was also contributing to Iorga's academic journal, Revue Historique du Sud-Est Européen. His essays there included the 1936 review of the Moldavian ASSR's standard primer Kuvyntu nostru, evidencing the agitprop aspect of Soviet education, the vilifying of [...] "kulak" [...] elements in Transnistrian society, and the plagiarizing of Romanian textbooks.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resistance}} to his application {{was a surprise}} for Șăineanu, who wrote: [...] "I was not aware that this path [...] is the more thorny as the [...] merits are more real." [...] He also accused the political establishment of endemic corruption, writing: [...] "any banker who demanded naturalization received it without the least of difficulties". During the following interval, Șăineanu's cause reportedly won the support of King Carol I, Conservative Premier Lascăr Catargiu and moderate National Liberal politico Mihail Kogălniceanu. Reviewing the situation, Șăineanu cited an unusual incident in neighboring Austria–Hungary, where local Romanians were demanding increased group rights {{as part of the}} Memorandum movement. Their arguments <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> repression were met with the reply of Hungarian intellectuals, who cited the Șăineanu issue as proof that Austria–Hungary had more to offer than Romania: [...] "He had all of Romania on his case, but he had rendered [...] as many services as most Romanian demigods." [...] In 1893, the naturalization request came before the lower chamber, resulting in a vote of 76 in favor to 20 against. According to the scholar's recollections, his only adversary in this forum was his former Convorbiri Literare colleague, writer Iacob Negruzzi, who reportedly stated the unsupported claim that Șăineanu had campaigned against Romania [...] "in English" [...] (Șăineanu believed that this was [...] "doubtlessly" [...] stated [...] "because [...] was completely unfamiliar to the majority of Chamber members").|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{trend in}} most {{countries}} and languages is towards the naming method used to describe US immigrants because it emphasises the status as full and equal citizens of the new country while providing information <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> roots. This system is also more appropriate to the situation of immigrants who {{have been living in}} the new country for a long time, especially when they stop using the original language. In any case, the self-designation of all population groups is nowadays however considered more important than any other criteria. Swedish-speaking inhabitants of Finland whose ancestors have lived there for centuries almost exclusively consider themselves Finns in the English sense of the word, the [...] "Swedish-speaking Finns" [...] is preferred by the most representative political organisation of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland, the Swedish Assembly of Finland. Many Finns and Swedes are unaware that the English word [...] "Finn" [...] usually means [...] "a native or inhabitant of Finland" [...] ( [...] , [...] ) and only sometimes also has the meaning [...] "a member of a people speaking Finnish or a Finnic language" [...] or has this as its primary but not exclusive meaning. More specifically, due to the extremely small number of immigrants in Finland, Finns still have a hard time understanding that the normal English expression for a naturalised Finnish citizen who immigrated from Vietnam, for example, is a Vietnamese Finn. These same linguistic problems were encountered in France, Germany, and many other countries before the native population became used to foreigners many decades ago.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1989 book In Search of the Indo-Europeans, Irish-American {{archaeologist}} J. P. Mallory, summarising {{the three}} existing theories concerning {{the end of}} the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, mentions that archaeological findings in the region indicate Kurgan (i.e. Yamna culture) settlements {{in the eastern part of}} the Cucuteni-Trypillia area, co-existing for some time with those of the Cucuteni-Trypillia. Artifacts from both cultures found within each of their respective archaeological settlement sites attest to an open trade in goods for a period, though he points out that the archaeological evidence clearly points to what he termed [...] "a dark age," [...] its population seeking refuge in every direction except east. He cites evidence of the refugees having used caves, islands and hilltops (abandoning in the process 600-700 settlements) to argue for the possibility of a gradual transformation rather than an armed onslaught bringing <b>about</b> <b>cultural</b> extinction. The obvious issue with that theory is the limited common historical life-time between the Cucuteni-Trypillia (4800-3000 BC) and the Yamna culture (3600-2300 BC); given that the earliest archaeological findings of the Yamna culture (3600-3200 BC) are located in the Volga-Don basin, not in the Dniester and Dnieper area where the cultures came in touch, while the Yamna culture came to its full extension in the Pontic steppe at the earliest around 3000 BC, the time the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture ended, thus indicating an extremely short survival after coming in contact with the Yamna culture. Another contradicting indication is that the kurgans that replaced the traditional horizontal graves in the area now contain human remains of a fairly diversified skeletal type approximately ten centimetres taller on average than the previous population.|$|E
