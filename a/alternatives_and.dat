5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of <b>alternatives</b> <b>and</b> another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

In 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced the Gallions Reach Crossing, a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead expected to open in 2017. The option of a bridge is still popular, with an alternative option of a tunnel in the area.

40|$|Set in {{the context}} of the recent {{controversy}} in New Zealand over the treatment of child cancer sufferer Liam Williams-Holloway, this article illustrates the role of health practitioners in the construction <b>and</b> reconfiguration of <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> conventional medicine. Analysis of the discursive practices of <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> conventional health practitioners demonstrates how they both strategically consolidate and contest so-called natural distinctions between <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> conventional medicine to validate their professions. It is argued that science, certainty and holism are used discursively by both <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> conventional practitioners to do boundary work. Their competing translations of what these actually constitute result in ongoing attempts to define science, certainty, and holism as practitioners attempt to protect their respective territories and contest the claims of others...|$|R

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 20 million animals are used annually for educational purposes in the United States including, classroom observational exercises, dissections and live-animal surgeries. Frogs, fetal pigs, perch, cats, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish and starfish are commonly used in classroom dissections. Alternatives {{to the use of}} animals in classroom dissections are widely used, with many U.S. States and school districts mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect.

5|$|Accenture {{estimated}} that the World Cup opening would bring R$30.75Billion over 10 years to the city's economy; the study's results encouraged Brazil to site the opening match in São Paulo. A study from Fundação Getúlio Vargas estimated R$1Billion in revenue during the World Cup, as 290 thousand tourists were expected for the event. After Morumbi Stadium was deemed unsuitable by FIFA, the Local World Cup Committee looked for <b>alternatives</b> <b>and</b> set on offering Arena Corinthians to host the opening game; FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Hosting the opening game required modifications to the project that raised the cost from the original R$335million to R$1.07billion to accommodate FIFA's requirements. Cuts in equipment, furniture and construction costs reduced the cost. Because of FIFA's agreements with Brazil, none of the construction work related to the World Cup was taxed by the Federal Government; the final price agreed upon was R$820million.|$|E

On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board increased funding for Phase 2 by $700 million. The new budget of $1.735 billion would allow for a near-term 30 percent match per Full Funding Grant Agreement process. By August 2017, preliminary work on the line was underway, and the engineering firm AKRF was updating the environmental impact study for Phase 2. AKRF had previously prepared the Manhattan East Side <b>Alternatives</b> <b>and</b> the original EIS for the Second Avenue Subway.

5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus.

After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Central to {{the debate}} {{regarding}} the effectiveness of <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> traditional teacher certification programs {{is the question of}} providing high quality teachers for high need schools. The Robert F. Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, funded by the National Science Foundation, supports both <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> traditional routes to teacher certification nationwide and has similar requirements for all teacher candidates. It, therefore, provided a unique opportunity to compare <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> traditional programs in terms of their perceived effectiveness in encouraging potential STEM teachers to teach in high need schools. Data came from a comprehensive, mixed methods evaluation of the Noyce Program and included 434 surveys completed by Noyce scholars, and 19 interviews with school district representatives. Comparisons between <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> traditional programs were made based on scholars’ demographics, affective characteristics, background experiences, and beliefs about teaching. Results demonstrated that Noyce scholars from <b>alternative</b> <b>and</b> traditional programs were similar in 27 demographic and most affective characteristics but different in background experiences and beliefs about teaching. Moreover, the data suggest that alternative routes might attract more candidates who are more likely to teach in high need schools...|$|R
