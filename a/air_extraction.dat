40|$|ABSTRACT: Hybrid Photovoltaic/Thermal (PV/T) {{systems can}} provide {{simultaneously}} electricity and heat, achieving also {{the reduction of}} PV operating temperature and keeping electrical efficiency at a sufficient level. In our laboratory we study PV/T systems, testing them with water or air as heat removal fluid. In this paper we present a PV/T system with dual heat extraction operation, either with water or with air circulation. The experimental model consists of a pc-Si PV module with an air channel at rear PV surface, properly constructed for flexibility in changing {{the place of the}} heat exchanger element of circulating water. We tested PV/T system in three design modes and the results showed that the placement of it on PV rear surface presents the most effective combination of water and <b>air</b> heat <b>extraction.</b> Aiming to the performance improvement of <b>air</b> heat <b>extraction</b> we increased the heat exchanging surface in the air channel and test results confirmed the rise in thermal efficiency for air circulation.

These systems are very robust and can tolerate {{a wide range of}} feed salinities, making them a good candidate for treating produced water from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. A primary engineering challenge for these systems is their high thermal energy consumption. In this study, we examine the use of multiple <b>air</b> <b>extractions</b> and injections to thermodynamically balance the HDH system, so as to make it more energy efficient. The effect of the number of extractions on several performance parameters is studied. In addition, we study the effect of the enthalpy pinch, which is a measure of performance for a heat and mass exchanger, on these performance parameters. Finally, we present results that can be used as guidelines in designing HDH systems. These results include the identification of appropriate temperatures for the extracted/injected air streams, the division of the heat duty between stages, and the value of the mass flow rate ratio in each stage at various values of enthalpy pinch.

50|$|In 2003 the Roads & Traffic Authority began {{completely}} repainting {{the southern}} approach spans of the bridge.

5000|$|Industrial areas often {{contaminate}} {{the soil with}} oil, toxic and persistent organic compounds. To clear these fields, soil heating by radio waves is frequently used. Fiber optical sensors are deployed to monitor and control this process. A high- power generator will deliver energy in radio frequency range. The polluted soil is covered with electrodes, which will heat the surface dielectric. Besides, several fiber optical probes are put in the soil. Depending on the measured value different values of temperature and temperature distribution can be realized in the soil.

50|$|Certain plants (e.g. most {{strains of}} cannabis) emit a {{distinctive}} odor during their reproductive phase. This presents difficulties {{to those who}} are cultivating in places where it is illegal, or for growers who may prefer discretion for other reasons. The most common way of eliminating odor is by pulling odorous air through a carbon filter. Many cultivators simply attach a large carbon filter to their <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> system, thereby filtering any smell before the air is expelled from the grow-room. Another way of eliminating odor is by installing an ozone generator in the extraction ducting. The air is forced past the ozone generator by the extraction fan, and the odorous air is neutralized as it mixes with the ozone; however the cultivator must ensure that the air is thoroughly mixed before it is expelled outside, lest some odor escape. Care must be taken to prevent excessive ozone concentrations in the garden itself, or where it might be inhaled by the grower or his/her family. Ozone itself has a distinctive smell and is harmful to living things, although the molecule breaks down quickly (20 minutes to an hour) in atmospheric conditions.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} {{results from the}} patent search and review of domestic and foreign publications in variable cycle engines (VCE) was created a classification of the possible schematic diagrams of VCE realizing three-stream engine technologies (the adaptive low pressure compressor (LPC) with <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> behind stages, FLADE compressor, various feeding types of extraction air to the flowing path of the engine, etc.). To estimate a three-stream engine application {{as a part of}} the power-plant (PP) efficiency, was chosen an adaptive LPC technology scheme with the third contour air bypass beyond the critical section of a basic jet nozzle for which a mathematical model (MM) of the PP has been created on the basis of one-dimensional MM of the engine. The MM of the PP included 3 D modeling results of the air inlet, the LPC with various air extractions to the third contour, and the jet nozzle taking into account the interaction between the basic stream and the third contour stream. The predicted performance of an air inlet have been used to estimate the changes in a total pressure restoration coefficient and an additional resistance coefficient along «a fluid contour» when <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> is included in the third contour in several cruiser modes of flight. An integrated characteristic of the LPC has been received at various points and levels of <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> to the third contour, and parameters of extracted air (depending on the point and amount of <b>air</b> <b>extraction,</b> and also on the fan operating mode) have been calculated. When analyzing the obtained calculation results, the effect of pressure lines displacement to the right (towards the large reduced rates), growth of efficiency values, and also position displacement of its maximum value to the left (towards the descent reduced rates) has been found. To estimate how <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> of the third contour between the plates of an adjustable supersonic nozzle impacts on its aft deck resistance various parameters of the flowing out air in subsonic cruiser mode of flight have been calculated. As a result of calculations according to the PP MM, under near-the-earth conditions of the subsonic cruiser flight, the effective specific fuel consumption has been reduced by 12, 5 %. The results reached allow us to expect significant subsonic effective fuel conservation of the three-stream engine. To prove the calculated results it is further necessary to achieve them under full-scale conditions using the engine-demonstrator. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the industrial problem of air current segregation in alumina storage silos which occurs with {{the handling of}} the feedstock alumina in aluminium plants. One significant parameter, the <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate, was studied in an experimental silo which was manufactured for this purpose. The experiments conducted in small scale devices displayed the interaction between the particle flow and air current segregation. Results from these experiments show that the increase of the silo <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate reduces air current segregation. The dimensional analysis method has been applied to form dimensionless groups out of the significant parameters. Five dimensionless groups were obtained which is unwieldy. To reduce the number of dimensionless groups the physical properties were lumped into the terminal velocity. This simplified approach gives three dimensionless groups.

40|$|Air current {{segregation}} (ACS) is one segregation {{phenomenon that}} has been identified to contribute significantly to the separation of fines(particlesb 42 μm) from coarse material during the filling of industrial silos. This paper describes investigations of ACS for alumina powder based on experiments conducted in an industrial silo, in the laboratory and by computation, using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code Fluent. For the industrial silo, the extent of ACS has been measured using the accumulation of fine material at the wall as an indicator. Based on these results, modifications to the feeding system were undertaken which showed that ACS is promoted if the material is fed in a dilute form. Experiments in the laboratory confirmed this effect visually. In {{order to be able}} to compare numerically the extend of ACS, a segregation index has been developed. It was found that a dilute particle jet leads to more ACS than dense particle jet. The effects of solids feeding rate and <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate on ACS have been investigated in the laboratory silo and the results clearly show that low solids feeding rates promote ACS. It was further found that an increase in the <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate has a mild effect in suppressing ACS.
