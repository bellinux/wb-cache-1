25|$|The city of Buenos Aires {{is neither}} part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, {{it is an}} {{autonomous}} district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (<b>Autonomous</b> <b>City</b> of Buenos Aires). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.|$|E

These new reguengo villages (royal villages under direct royal political and economical control, and administered by their <b>autonomous</b> <b>city</b> councils), each one usually known as a burgo due to its walled circuits, constituted important attraction points for peasants, who could find better life conditions under the direct protection of the king than abroad {{under the authority of}} a bishop, a monastery or a nobleman; but they also attracted foreigners, most notably artisans and merchants, who brought new trends and knowledges. These burgs supposed a revolution in the social structure of the time, leading to economic diversification, removing the dominant autarky of the previous centuries, and facilitating the development of fishing and pre-industrial activities oriented toward the mass production of some resources, especially salted and dried fish, fish oil, and wine, marketed through the seaports north to England, and south to the Mediterranean.|$|E
