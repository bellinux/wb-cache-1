25|$|The {{community}} of visible interacting beings and the cosmos {{is referred to}} as ụ̀wà, which includes all living things íhẹ́ ndi dị́ ńdụ̀, including animals and vegetation and their mineral elements which possess a vital force and are regarded as counterparts to invisible forces in the spirit world. These living things and geomorphological features of the world therefore possess a guardian deity. Igbo cosmology presents a balance between the feminine and masculine, perhaps, with a preponderance of female representation in Igbo lore. In Igbo cosmology, the world was divided into four corners by the high god corresponding to èké órìè àfọ̀ ǹkwọ́ which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the week in the Igbo calendar regarded as market days. The universe is regarded as a composite of bounded spaces in an overlapping hemispherical structure, the total spaces are referred to as élú nà àlà. In one Igbo cosmological theory reported by W.R.G. Morton in the 1950s from an elder in Ibagwa Nike in northern Igboland, Chukwu sees that the sun travels across the world in the day time and then cuts into two in order for the moon to pass on a perpendicular route, and so the world is divided into four parts and four days. The quarterly division of the earth and the days makes the number four sacred (ńsọ́) to the Igbo. The élú nà àlà space is defined by two boundaries: élú ígwé, 'sky's limit' composed of heavenly bodies under the main forces of the 'masculine' sun and 'feminine' moon, and élú àlà, 'earth or lands limit' consisting of the four material elements of fire and air (masculine), and earth and water (feminine).|$|E

500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [...] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [...] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.' ...|$|E

Maimonides ruled that all Jews must believe with perfect faith, each day, that the mashiach will come and the resurrected of the dead will take place. He rules that anyone who does not believe this, denies the entire Torah. The Chafetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, wrote [...] "our days <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of Messiah’s coming.

2500|$|Michael {{performed}} at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992 at London's Wembley Stadium. The concert was {{a tribute to}} the life of the late Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury, with the proceeds going to AIDS research.

This track had featured {{at the beginning of the}} year on the Innuendo album, and the video for it was recorded in May 1991 (which proved to be Mercury's final work with Queen). It had already been released as a single in the US in September that year. The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks – the only recording to top the Christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years (1975, 1976, 1991, and 1992). Initial proceeds from the single – approximately £1,000,000 – were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity.|$|E

In leap years (every fourth year except centennial years) a day is added after Mid-year's Day called Overlithe. [...] All these days are placed outside of any month. These days are primarily holidays and feast days. Mid-year's Day is meant to correspond to the summer solstice, which Tolkien describes as being 10 days earlier than the middle day of our year. However, since then the summer solstice has shifted slightly so it falls on a different date now, rendering the difference between Mid-year's Day and the middle day of our year eleven days, instead of ten.|$|E
