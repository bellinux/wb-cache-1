2500|$|For decades β-blockers {{have been}} used in {{cardiovascular}} medicine. They have proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. In acute coronary syndrome, β-blockers have been recommended as a class I-A indication in clinical practice guidelines, because the treatment decreases the mortality rate. β-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, reduce the workload of the heart and its oxygen requirement. β-blockers are sometimes used in a combination therapy to treat angina, if a β-blocker doesn't work well enough on its own. They are used as <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> drugs in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. The treatment with β-blockers reduces the incidence of sudden heart failure when the patient has already had a myocardial infarction. The reason is probably because of their <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> effects and also anti-ischemic effects. [...] A β-blocker therapy is also useful in myocardial infarction, independent to heart failure. The therapy has been very helpful for high-risk patients. [...] All β-blockers are able to lower blood pressure and therefore are they the first choice of drugs for hypertension. But if they are used along with calcium channel blockers, β-blockers have more functionality. They also have an effect on cardiomyopathy, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and portal hypertension, to name a few.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Benefits {{of cardiac}} {{rehabilitation}} with exercise therapy are well-established, although individual reactions are heterogeneous. The identification of determinants of training effects is useful from a prognostic point of view, but data regarding this are scarce. Furthermore, limited data {{exist on the}} determinants of complications during exercise in cardiac patients. This study aimed to investigate the determinants (1) of training effects in cardiac rehabilitation and (2) of complications requiring resuscitation during exercise activities {{at the hospital and}} during continued exercise at a sports club for cardiac patients. DESIGN: Clinical association study. METHODS: Determinants of changes in peak oxygen uptake (VO 2) after 3 months of cardiac rehabilitation were determined by multiple regression analysis (n= 1909). Determinants of events requiring resuscitation (n= 21) were assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Improvements in peak VO 2 and exercise duration averaged 26 %. Eighteen per cent of the variance in absolute improvements of peak VO 2 was explained, with age and training characteristics as the strongest determinants. Twenty-one per cent of the variation in relative improvements was explained, with baseline exercise performance and training characteristics being the strongest determinants. The intake of <b>anti-arrhythmics</b> (odds ratio= 5. 5; P or = 1 mm) at baseline exercise testing (odds ratio= 1. 6; P< 0. 001) were predictive for serious complications. The occurrence of events requiring resuscitation was higher at the sports club (1 / 16, 533 versus 1 / 29, 214 patient-hours).

30|$|Cardiology has {{improved}} outcomes through well-designed, large RCTs and emphasizes {{a model of}} cooperation between academia and industry [28]. Cardiology RCTs adjusted design from lessons learned from earlier missteps. For example, the CAST trial [29, 30] enrolled patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias and randomized to the <b>anti-arrhythmics</b> moricizine, encainide or flecainide versus placebo. At the first interim analysis, the DSMB recommended stopping the encainide and flecainide arms (pooled mortality was higher than placebo). Ironically, a later editorial bemoaned that two “potentially efficacious” drugs could be removed from clinical usage, not mentioning the increased mortality [30]. CAST catalyzed rigorous, independent monitoring of RCTs [31] [e.g., Academic Research Organizations in independent DSMBs and regulatory guidance on DSMB function (www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/ 98 fr/ 01 d- 0489 -gdl 0003.pdf)].|$|R
40|$|Meta-analyses {{showed that}} psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, {{antiepileptic}} drugs) and some cardiac drugs (digoxin, type IA <b>anti-arrhythmics,</b> diuretics) {{are associated with}} increased fall risk. Because balance and gait disorders are the most consistent predictors of future falls, falls due to use of these so-called fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) might be partly caused by impairments of postural control that these drugs can induce. Therefore, the effects of FRIDs on postural control were examined by reviewing literature. Electronic databases and reference lists of identified papers were searched until June 2013. Only controlled research papers examining the effects of FRIDs on postural control were included. FRIDs were defined according to meta-analyses as antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, digoxin, type IA <b>anti-arrhythmics,</b> and diuretics. Ninety-four papers were included, of which study methods for quantifying postural control, {{and the effects of}} FRIDs on postural control were abstracted. Postural control was assessed with a variety of instruments, mainly evaluating aspects of body sway during quiet standing. In general, postural control was impaired, indicated by an increase in parameters quantifying body sway, when using psychotropic FRIDs. The effects were more pronounced when people were of a higher age, used psychotropics at higher daily doses, with longer half-lives, and administered for a longer period. From the present literature review, it can be concluded that psychotropic drugs cause impairments in postural control, which {{is probably one of the}} mediating factors for the increased fall risk these FRIDs are associated with. The sedative effects of these drugs on postural control are reversible, as was proven in intervention studies where FRIDs were withdrawn. The findings of the present literature review highlight the importance of using psychotropic drugs in the older population only at the lowest effective dose and for a limited period of time. ...|$|R
40|$|Background New-onset atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is the most}} common arrhythmia in critically ill patients. Although evidence base and expert consensus opinion for management have been summarised in several international guidelines, no specific considerations for critically ill patients have been included. We aimed to establish current practice of management of critically ill patients with new-onset AF. Methods We designed a short user-friendly online questionnaire. All members of the Intensive Care Society were invited via email containing a link to the questionnaire, which comprised 21 questions. The online survey was conducted between November 2016 and December 2016. Results The response rate was 397 / 3152 (12. 6 %). The majority of respondents (81. 1 %) worked in mixed Intensive Care Units and were consultants (71. 8 %). Most respondents (39. 5 %) would start intervention on patients with fast new-onset AF and stable blood pressure at a heart rate between 120 and 139 beats/min. However, 34. 8 % of participants would treat all patients who developed new-onset fast AF. Amiodarone and beta-blockers (80. 9 % and 11. 6 % of answers) were the most commonly used <b>anti-arrhythmics.</b> A total of 63. 8 % of respondents do not regularly anti-coagulate critically ill patients with new-onset fast AF, while 30. 8 % anti-coagulate within 72 hours. A total of 68. 0 % of survey respondents do not routinely use stroke risk scores in critically ill patients with new-onset AF. A total of 85. 4 % of participants would consider taking part in a clinical trial investigating treatment of new-onset fast AF in the critically ill. Discussion Our results suggest a considerable disparity between contemporary practice of management of new-onset AF in critical illness and treatment recommendations for the general patient population suffering from AF, particularly with regard to <b>anti-arrhythmics</b> and anti-coagulation used. Amongst intensivists, there is a substantial interest in research for management of new-onset AF in critically ill patients...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{reversal}} {{occurs when}} a new clinical trial — superior to predecessors by virtue of better controls, design, size, or endpoints — contradicts current clinical practice. In recent years, we have witnessed several instances of medical reversal. Famous examples include the class 1 C <b>anti-arrhythmics</b> post-myocardial infarction (contradicted by the CAST trial) or routine stenting for stable coronary disease (contradicted by the COURAGE trial). In this paper, we explore the phenomenon of medical reversal. The causes and consequences are discussed. Conflicts of interest among researchers and an unyielding faith in basic science are explored as root causes of reversal. Reversal harms patients who undergo the contradicted therapy during the years it was in favor and those patients who undergo the therapy in the lag time before a change in medical practice. Most importantly, it creates a loss {{of faith in the}} medical system by physicians and patients. The solution to reversal is upfront, randomized clinical trials for new clinical practices and a systematic method to evaluate practices already in existence...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{majority}} of patients with cardiomyopathy are {{in the category of}} primary or idiopathic cardiomyopathy, for which therapy is symptomatic and non-specific, {{there are a number of}} secondary forms of cardiomyopathy for which specific therapy is available, thus giving impetus to prompt and accurate diagnosis. Among inflammatory lesions, brucellosis, psittacosis and toxoplasmosis are examples. Treatable metabolic causes include thyrotoxicosis and thiamine deficiency, the latter as well as calorie-protein malnutrition are also preventable. There is presumptive evidence that the cardiomyopathy of haemochromatosis is benefited by repeated phlebotomies. Symptomatic relief of obstructive cardiomyopathy is achieved by beta-adrenergic blockade, although resection of obstructing myocardium still has a place. The therapeutic approach to the vast majority of cases of congestive cardiomyopathy is non-specific, comprising controlled activity, sodium restriction, digitalis and diuretics. Vasodilators and, occasionally, beta-adrenergic blockade may be beneficial. Pacemakers may be life-saving, whereas the place of <b>anti-arrhythmics</b> remains uncertain.
