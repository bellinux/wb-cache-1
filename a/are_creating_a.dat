500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they <b>are</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another common term is [...] "Stud". A stud is a {{dominant}} lesbian, usually butch. They {{tend to be}} influenced by urban and hip-hop cultures and are often, but not always, Afro-American. In the New York City lesbian community a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary The Aggressives, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men. But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York <b>are</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> new, insular scene that's largely cut {{off from the rest of}} the gay and lesbian community. [...] "A lot of it has to do with this kind of pressure to articulate and express your masculinity within the confines of the hip-hop paradigm..." [...] The AG culture has also been represented on film by Black lesbian filmmaker Dee Rees' 2011 work, Pariah.|$|E
2500|$|No further {{conventions}} {{have been}} held since 1977, {{but they have been}} frequently proposed, in part because of [...] the recent spate of state fiscal crises. [...] Some have proposed conventions to determine conclusively whether or not the Tennessee Constitution allows a general, broad-based income tax on wages. It has been suggested by several observers that one reason against the General Assembly requesting future conventions is that they do not desire to create potential new rivals for themselves; as the members themselves cannot be delegates to the convention, in calling for a convention, they <b>are</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> potential new set of politicians campaigning in their same districts and addressing some of the same issues. That occurred to an extent after the 1977 convention, which launched the career, among others, of Memphis attorney Steve Cohen, who was vice president of the convention and later became a prominent progressive Democrat in the Tennessee State Senate, until 2006, when he was elected U.S. Representative from the Ninth District.|$|E
2500|$|International Men's Day {{was inaugurated}} in Zimbabwe on 19 November 2011. The commemorations {{were held at}} Chibuku Stadium in Chitungwiza under the theme Giving The Boy Child The Best Possible Start In Life. Fred Misi, the {{chairman}} of Men's Forum Varume Svinurai/Vhukhani said the commemorations {{came at a time}} when attention was being given to the girl child at the expense of boys, and noted, [...] "Whilst it is important to focus on the specific needs of the girl child, we <b>are</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> crisis by ignoring the specific needs of the boy child." [...] Misi highlighted the growing trend that many boys were dropping out of school and were hooked on hard drugs as well as abusing alcohol, while a significant number of those who were completed secondary and tertiary education were roaming the streets because of unemployment. He added the government and Zimbabweans needed to act immediately. A number of prominent persons attended and gave papers on the need to give the boy child assistance. There was drama and poetry from various groups and individual high school students in line with the theme of the celebrations, and the Zimbabwe Minister of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development, Olivia Muchena gave a key note address in which she said, [...] "It is an occasion for men to celebrate their achievements and contributions, in particular their contributions to community, family, marriage and child care while highlighting the discrimination against them... International Men's Day is an opportunity for people everywhere of good will to appreciate and celebrate the men in their life and the contributions they make to society for the greater good of all hence it being important for us to celebrate this day equally as we did with The International Women's Day." ...|$|E
