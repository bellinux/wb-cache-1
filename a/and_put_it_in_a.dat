500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E

[...] The first man understand the bird and he responded by getting ready with his canoe. Near the mouth of the Cheakamus River, is a small mountain, and a little bay that fit his canoe. He tied his canoe here and took out his pole, a long shaft used to pull along the river. He put moss around the pole, then placed the pole down. So when the fish touch the pole, their slime was wiped on the moss. He knew that the Transformers were coming further down river. He grabbed the pole and waited for a fish to touch it, then would pull out the pole and see where the salmon touched. He took the slime <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wooden plate and put his pole down again. Then he heard the three brothers coming. Then the apocalypse came.|$|E
