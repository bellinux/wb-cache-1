He told the board he was leaving to set up <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> company, {{and that he would}} be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him. He also told the board that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing its designs back to them to market under the Macintosh brand.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Gygax {{began work}} on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> {{role-playing}} game called Lejendary Adventures. In contrast to the rules-heavy Dangerous Journeys, this new system was a return to simple and basic rules. Although {{he was not able}} to successfully release a Lejendary Adventures computer game, Gygax decided to instead publish it as a tabletop game.|$|E
5|$|The Nuclear Reactor Building {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, after a {{campaign}} led by an architecture student in response to the proposed demolition of the building. Amid concerns from preservation groups and the City of Seattle, the UW Board of Regents ultimately decided in February 2016 to demolish the structure. The building was demolished in July 2016 and will be replaced by <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> science building.|$|E

5|$|The artbox {{design for}} Funimation's North American {{release of the}} School Rumble anime resembles a {{miniature}} metal locker, {{and each of the}} individually released DVDs comes with heavy duty magnets. The discs include subtitled interviews with the Japanese voice actors, which were compiled onto a third DVD for the full first season release. In 2007, Funimation ran a drawing contest prior to releasing the anime in North America. The grand prize included <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> with software for developing anime and manga. The United Kingdom anime release by Revelation Films saw the same limited edition box as Funimation, along with two standard editions.|$|E
5|$|Cranor spent $42 million {{restructuring}} the company's operations worldwide. He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 million on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, {{beginning with a}} 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain {{had to contend with}} the rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E

25|$|During development, the Palo Alto {{design team}} {{were working on}} a Unix-only {{workstation}} that originally included the PRISM. However, development of the workstation was well ahead of the PRISM, and the engineers proposed that they release the machines using the MIPS R2000 processor instead, moving its release date up considerably. DEC management doubted the need to produce <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> architecture to replace their existing VAX and DECstation lines, and eventually ended the PRISM project in 1988.|$|E
25|$|In July 2006 {{renovation}} of Lambton station began, {{to improve its}} looks and accessibility. The works were budgeted at $1.3 million, scheduled {{to be completed in}} early November. On 18 December the renovated station came into use, with automated turnstiles (and a substantial price rise). Lingering problems with the ticketing system upgrade were fixed during the October 2007 annual survey. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> was also added to the winding mechanism during the survey which has caused a few temporary issues with how smoothly the cars run.|$|E
25|$|Chilean {{software}} engineer Jorge Arellano Cid conceived the Dillo project in late 1999, publishing {{the first version}} of Dillo in December of that year.

Arellano Cid believed that no one should have to buy <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> or pay for broadband in order to enjoy the World Wide Web. To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a dial-up Internet access.|$|E

25|$|The final {{building}} {{addition to}} the existing old Kermit High School building was sought in 1982 and the construction was completed in 1983.

In {{addition to the}} building extensions, the ceilings were lowered in order to install new heating and air conditioning systems.

On January 1, 2005, he renamed it Archy. It is a system incarnating his concepts of the humane interface, by using open source elements within his rendition of a ZUI or Zooming User Interface. In the same period Raskin accepted an appointment as Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago's Computer Science Department and, with Leo Irakliotis, started designing a new curriculum on humane interfaces and computer enterprises.|$|E
25|$|Trials {{started in}} 2013 with the VTS also supervising {{the access to}} Bergen from the south. In {{particular}} Vatlestraumen and Hjelteskjæret were critical points where multiple sea lanes meet. Due to surplus working capacity amongst the two people on duty, this could be carried out without additional cost. The boathouse received a major upgrade in 2014, receiving a dormitory section and a new workshop. The same year <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> system was installed along with upgrades to the radars. This allows for additional accuracy and better integrates multi-source real-time data.

25|$|At {{first there}} was some {{question}} as to what exactly the new company should do. It did not seem {{that there would be}} any way for them to afford to develop <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer,</b> given that the now-large CDC had been unable to support more than one. When the President in charge of financing traveled to Wall Street to look for seed capital, he {{was surprised to find that}} Cray's reputation was very well known. Far from struggling for some role to play in the market, the financial world was more than willing to provide Cray with all the money they would need to develop a new machine.|$|E
25|$|The BCS {{continued}} to purge ranking systems which included margin of victory, causing {{the removal of}} the Matthews and Rothman ratings before the 2002 season. Sagarin provided a BCS-specific formula that did not include margin of victory, and the New York Times index returned in a form without margin of victory considerations. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> ranking, the Wesley Colley Matrix, was added. The lowest ranking was dropped and the remaining six averaged. Also in 2002, the quality win component was modified such that the deduction for beating the No. 1 team in the BCS would be 1.0, declining by 0.1 increments until beating the 10th ranked team at 0.1. Teams on probation {{were not included in the}} BCS standings, but quality win points were given to teams who beat teams on probation as if they were ranked accordingly in the BCS.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{campus is}} {{centered}} around the academic mall which stretches {{for more than a}} quarter of a mile from the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics in the west end to the Administration Building in the east end.

40|$|<b>As</b> <b>new</b> <b>computer</b> {{architectures}} {{are developed}} to exploit large-scale data-level parallelism, techniques {{are needed to}} retarget legacy sequential code to these platforms. Sequential programming languages force programmers to include sequential artifacts in their code, {{particularly with respect to}} how the source code expresses data references (generally assuming a linear address space). In contrast, data-parallel programs apply many operations in parallel to elements in twodimensional data sets, and a given data parallel operation can access other spatially local elements along either dimension. Of key importance in exposing data parallelism is determining these two-dimensional data dependencies among elements of a matrix. This pape...|$|R
