5000|$|Trouble in Molopolis (1970), Mora's first feature-length film, was {{financed by}} the {{partnership}} of Arthur Boyd and Eric Clapton. It was shot in London, with Mora recalling, [...] "every Australian I knew was pulled into the picture". It was filmed in Robert Hughes' apartment and at the Pheasantry. Germaine Greer played a cabaret singer, Jenny Kee was 'Shanghai Lil', Laurence Hope played a gangster, Martin Sharp featured as a mime and Richard Neville as a PR man. Tony Cahill from The Easybeats created the music with Jamie Boyd before the film premiered at the Paris Pullman cinema in Chelsea, as an Oz benefit. Introduced by George Melly, {{the star of the}} film, John Ivor Golding, also made a memorable appearance at the premiere, defecating in the front row and then passing out in an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this investigation, {{the effects}} of hypoglycemic coma and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma</b> on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) {{permeability}} have been compared. Female adult Wistar albino rats weighing 180 - 230 g were divided into three groups: Control group (n= 8), <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Coma</b> Group (n= 18), and Hypoglycemic Coma group (n= 12). The animals went into coma approximately 3 - 4 hours after insulin administration and 3 - 5 minutes after alcohol administration. Evans blue (4 mL/kg) was injected intravenously as BBB tracer. It was observed that the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma</b> did not significantly increase the BBB permeability {{in any of the}} brain regions when compared to control group. Changes in BBB permeability were significantly increased by the hypoglycemic coma in comparison to the control group values (p < 0. 01). Our findings suggest that hypoglycemic and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma</b> have different effects on the BBB permeability depending on the energy metabolism. </span...|$|E

40|$|Two {{cases of}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma</b> are {{presented}} where extensor responses to noxious stimuli are demonstrated. Decerebrate posturing normally indicates severe structural or functional depression of midbrain function {{but can be}} caused by depressant drugs. Blood alcohol measurements are a vital test in the comatose patient as the clinical picture may be caused, or temporarily significantly worsened, by severe alcohol intoxication. The preservation of pupillary light reflexes in the presence of deep coma with decerebrate posturing should alert the clinician to a possible metabolic cause for the coma, including alcohol. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma</b> should not be made unless the blood alcohol concentration is grossly elevated and other causes of coma have been excluded by careful physical examination, blood glucose and electrolyte measurement, skull radiography and, {{in the absence of a}} rapid improvement, computerized tomography...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{studied the}} impact of {{intravenous}} laser hemotherapy on the course of rat <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma</b> caused by intragastric 40 % ethanol administration. Intravenous laser blood irradiation promoted reduced mortality rates, diminished neurological deficit, earlier clinical recovery, and the optimized sympathetic/parasympathetic central nervous system ratio. Clinical and functional studies {{of changes in the}} central nervous system and retina were made in patients admitted for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma.</b> Intravenous laser blood irradiation as part of complex detoxification therapy positively affected the altered function of the higher nervous activity, contributed to earlier conscious recovery and emergence from coma, diminished neurological deficit in the early postcomatose period — alleviated brain edema, a drastic relief of pyramidal insufficiency and cramps, which was detectable in the visual assessment of electroencephalograms, their spectral coherent analysis, as well in the analysis of systemic and regional electroretinography.  </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{glucagon}} peptide {{could be}} used in diagnostics tests or for the treatment of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma,</b> biliary tract pain, hypoglycaemia (as a bronchodilator), etc. (Guimarães et al. 2011). Furthermore, glucagon has been on the Brazilian SM Program list since 2008. Currently, glucagon is imported from other countries, and initial production of new substances is restricted to universities and research centres (Massi et al. 2013). The main activity of glucagon involves the primary regulation of glucose production in the liver in situations of fasting, exercise and hypoglycaemia (Ramnanan et al. 2011). Hancock and colleagues (2010) indicated that the main glucagon activity was associated with glycemic control in fasting and postprandial situations. Therefore, glucagon utilisation is important since this hormone shows a fundamental role in glycemic control and, consequently, the maintenance of homeostasis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Previous {{studies have}} {{documented}} structural and functional changes induced by ethanol–erythrocyte membrane in-teraction. In order {{to perform an}} in vitro study {{on the effect of}} different ethanol concentrations on erythrocyte hemorheologic properties, blood samples were collected from 21 male donors at the Hospital of Santa Maria. Whole blood aliquots were incubated with ethanol solutions of rising concentrations. The following parameters were measured: erythrocyte aggregation, haemoglobin, carboxyhaemoglobin and methaemoglobin concentrations, hematocrit, plasma osmolality and erythrocyte mem-brane fluidity (fluorescence polarisation probes TMA-DPH and DPH). With ethanol blood concentrations of 45 mM a rise in plasma osmolality (0. 352 Osm/kg H 2 O vs 0. 310 Osm/kg H 2 O; p < 0. 001) was verified. With 67 mM concentration a decrease of erythrocyte aggregation (11. 03 vs 12. 81; p < 0. 05) and an increase in plasma osmolality (0. 380 Osm/kg H 2 O vs 0. 310 Osm/kg H 2 O; p < 0. 001) were obtained. In conclusion, ethanol only changes erythrocyte aggregation for a concentration of 67 mM. These data could lead to future changes in therapeutic approaches to situations such as <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|A 44 -year old builder {{and former}} smoker {{was seen in}} the chest policlinic. He was {{generally}} in good health, but complaining of chest pains, dys-pnea and a cough. In his past history, he was an al-coholic. He had been working as a builder for ap-proximately 25 years. In physical examination, there were no significant findings except for breathing sounds heard less clearly in the basal part of the left lung and digital clubbing was not seen. In the laboratory, haemogram and biochem-ical results were normal. Sedimentation rate was 2 mm / hr. The chest radiograph showed a 10 cm di-ameter mass in the left base adjacent to the di-aphragm (figure 1). A Computed Tomographic (CT) scan of the chest showed 12. 5 x 9 x 10 cm, smooth-contoured mass in the left lower lobe abutting the diaphragm (figure 2). The bron-choscopy was normal. No distant metastases was found. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was per-formed, and a solitary, 12 x 15 x 20 cm, firm, pale yellow mass arising on a long, thin pedicle from the diapraghmatic visceral pleura of the left lower lobe was found. The tumor was rich with vessels and excised with a margin of normal lung. The pathological diagnosis was a benign fibrous mesothelioma with no nuclear aberrations or mi-totic figures (figure 3). The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. There was no recurrence reported during his fol-low up, but he died two years after the operation due to an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma...</b>|$|E
30|$|In Brazil, {{there is}} a growing demand for {{specialised}} pharmaceuticals, and the high cost of their importation results in increasing costs, reaching US$ 1.34 billion in 2012 and US$ 1.61 billion in 2013. Worldwide expenses related to drugs could reach US$ 1.3 trillion in 2018, especially due to new treatments for hepatitis C and cancer. Specialised or high-cost pharmaceutical drugs used for the treatment of viral hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, HIV and diabetes are distributed free of charge by the Brazilian government. The glucagon peptide was included in this group of high-cost biopharmaceuticals in 2008. Although its main application is the treatment of hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients, it can also be used with patients in an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>coma,</b> for those patients with biliary tract pain, and as a bronchodilator. Therefore, in order to reduce biopharmaceutical production costs, the Brazilian government passed laws focusing on the development and increase of a National Pharmaceutical Industrial Centre, including the demand for the national production of glucagon. For that reason and given the importance and high cost of recombinant glucagon, {{the purpose of this study}} was to develop methods to improve production, purification and performance of the biological activity of recombinant glucagon. Glucagon was recombined into a plasmid vector containing a Glutathione S-transferase tag, and the peptide was expressed in a heterologous Escherichia coli system. After purification procedures and molecular analyses, the biological activity of this recombinant glucagon was examined using in vivo assays and showed a highly significant (p[*]<[*] 0.00001) and prolonged effect on glucose levels when compared with the standard glucagon. The experimental procedure described here facilitates the high level production of recombinant glucagon with an extended biological activity.|$|E
