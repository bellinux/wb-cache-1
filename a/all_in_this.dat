In 1937 he composed {{his first major}} liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which {{has become the most}} frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and {{it was not until the}} 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.|$|E

The events of The Yellow Admiral again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.|$|E

The castle schools were approved by the European Governors to educate the Euro-African children of European men and Gold Coast African women.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 20th century {{historical}} materialism gained much popularity in Norwegian historiography. Its proponents, e.g. Edvard Bull and Andreas Holmsen, sought to explain the civil wars on a social and economic basis. They assumed that Norwegian society became more stratified in the 12th century, with large groups of previously self-owning farmers sinking to the status of tenant-farmers, while the lendmenn and the Church amassed great landholdings. This created conflicts which found an outlet in the civil wars. There is also an assumption that certain regions, such as Trøndelag and inner parts of eastern Norway, were more egalitarian and therefore opposed the more stratified regions of the country. These attempts to introduce a form of class struggle-explanation to the conflicts have lost ground more recently, as they seem to have little foundation in the sources. It has not been possible to show empirically that an increased stratification of society in fact took place at <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period. Indeed, recent studies seem to indicate that this was not the case. Knut Helle emphasises the steady strengthening of royal power throughout the civil war era. When the period ended, the concept of a unitary kingdom (as opposed to power-sharing) had been accepted, the beginnings of a centralized administration had appeared and the king's power had increased so that a strong king would be able to contain social and geographical splits without them leading to open war. In this perspective the civil wars {{can be seen as the}} final phase in the unification of Norway into one kingdom.|$|E
