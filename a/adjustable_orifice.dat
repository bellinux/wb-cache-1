25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifice</b> (usually a needle valve). The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E
2500|$|The wide use of {{feedback}} controllers {{did not become}} feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added {{by the use of}} a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the [...] "Stabilog" [...] controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows.

40|$|Flow {{behavior}} of dry minerals in silos {{has been investigated}} initially with glass funnels with different orifices. Thereafter, funnel was scaled up to a pilot plant (Silo) with <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifices</b> at its discharge end. The flow rates vs particle size were investigated with beach mineral sands and quartz grains of varying sizes obtained from river sand. Zero flow rates were observed at d/D ratio of 1 / 5 - 1 / 4 for large size sand grains. For small grains of size about 200 microns zero flow rate was observed for orifice diameters 1. 5, 2. 0 and 3. 5 cms respectively due to 'floc' effect arising probably from static electrical charges of the powder and the humidity of air prevailing {{at the time of}} investigation...|$|R
40|$|This type of {{technology}} {{is a part of}} the group of air pollution controls collectively referred to as “wet scrubbers. ” Orifice scrubbers are also known as self-induced spray scrubbers, gasinduced spray scrubbers, and entrainment scrubbers. 2. Type of Technology: Removal of air pollutants by inertial and diffusional interception. 3. Applicable Pollutants: Orifice scrubbers are primarily used to control particulate matter (PM), including particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (µm) in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10), particulate matter less than or equal to 2. 5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5), down to particles with an aerodynamic diameter of approximately 2 µm (EPA, 1998). 4. Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: Orifice scrubber collection efficiencies range from 80 to 99 percent, depending upon the application and scrubber design. This type of scrubber relies on inertial and diffusional interception for PM collection. Some orifice scrubbers are designed with <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifices</b> t...|$|R

40|$|A design {{analysis}} of a variable <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifice</b> {{that can be used}} on all fuel channels is presented. With an adjustmert range of 1 / 4 turn the flow can be controlled over the range 9. 9 to 36. 9 lb/sec with a constant sensitivity of 5. 85 deg F/deg. rot. for DELTA T = 400 deg F. Temperature sensitivity can be reduced by increasing the adjustmert range; a rang of 3 / 8 turn will reduce the sensitivity to less than 4 deg F per degree rotation. The orifice contraction coefficient must be determined experimentally. Leakage flow through the annulus between the process channel and the orifice extension tube was taken into account. A 1 / 32 inch wide annular clearance is the maximum that can be tolerated to maintain control of the flow. (auth...|$|E
40|$|A {{pultrusion}} machine {{employing a}} corrugated impregnator vessel to immerse multiple, continuous strand, fiber tow in an impregnating material, and an <b>adjustable</b> metered exit <b>orifice</b> for the impregnator vessel {{to control the}} quantity of impregnating material retained by the impregnated fibers, is provided. An adjustable height insert retains transverse rod elements within each depression of the corrugated vessel to maintain the individual fiber tows spread and {{in contact with the}} vessel bottom. A series of elongated heating dies, transversely disposed on the pultrusion machine and having flat heating surfaces with radiused edges, ensure adequate temperature exposed dwell time and exert adequate pressure on the impregnated fiber tows, to provide the desired thickness and fiber/resin ratio in the prepreg formed. The prepreg passing through the pulling mechanism is wound on a suitable take-up spool for subsequent use. A formula is derived for determining the cross sectional area opening of the metering device. A modification in the heating die system employs a heated nip roller in lieu of one of the pressure applying flat dies...|$|R
40|$|A new {{adjustable}} damper is {{evaluated in}} this study. The damper {{is capable of}} providing different levels of damping based on the fluid pressure differential across the piston and fluid flowing through an <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifice.</b> Such dampers {{can be used for}} seismic protection of structures. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of adjustable dampers for mitigation of earthquake excitations. The new damper is tested under cyclic and ramp loadings. From the tests, the damping properties are established. Analytical studies are performed based on the test results. A two-story base isolated structure with adjustable damper is studied analytically. The analytical model is subjected to several near-fault earthquakes.

40|$|Flow-metering devices {{used by the}} NACA and by the {{manufacturer}} of the J 33 turbojet engine were calibrated together to determine whether an observed discrepancy in weight flow of approximately 4 percent for the two separate investigations {{might be due to}} the different devices used to meter air flow. A commercial <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifice</b> and a square-edge flat-plate orifice used by the NACA and a flow nozzle used by {{the manufacturer}} were calibrated against surveys across the throat of the nozzle. It was determined that over a range of weight flows from 18 to 45 pounds per second the average weight flows measured by the metering device used for the compressor test would be 0. 70 percent lower than those measured by the metering device used in the engine tests and the probable variation about this mean would be +/- 0. 39 percent. The very close agreement of the metering devices shows that the greater part of the discrepancy in weight flow is attributable to the effect of inlet pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifice,</b> comprising two first legs (15) {{which can be}} swivelled about their centre and two second legs (16) which are attached in movable bearings with the first legs (15) together forming a parallelogram and which bear one gap cutter (4, 5) {{of a pair of}} gap cutters, and of an operating device by means of which the shape of the parallelogram can be changed against the effect of a restoring force and thus the spacing of the gap cutters. The main feature of the invention is that the operating device consists of a piezoactuator (14) which is arranged between the first two legs (15) laterally spaced from the bearing points (13) of said legs (15), and that the adjacent first and second legs (15, 16) are interlinked by solid spring joints (11, 11 '), whereby all the articulated points (11, 11 ', 13) of one of the first legs (15) are offset by the amount (V) compared with the articulated points of the other first leg (15) transverse to the direction of move ment (19) of the piezoactuator (14).

40|$|A Joule-Thomson {{cryogenic}} {{refrigeration system}} capable of achieving high temperature stabilities {{in the presence}} of varying temperature, atmospheric pressure, and heat load is provided. The Joule-Thomson cryogenic refrigeration system includes a demand flow Joule-Thomson expansion valve disposed in a cryostat of the refrigeration system. The expansion valve has an <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifice</b> that controls the flow of compressed gas therethrough and induces cooling and partial liquefaction of the gas. A recuperative heat exchanger is disposed in the cryostat and coupled to the expansion valve. A thermostatically self-regulating mechanism is disposed in the cryostat and coupled to the J-T expansion valve. The thermostatically self-regulating mechanism automatically adjusts the cross sectional area of the adjustable valve orifice in response to environmental temperature changes and changes in power dissipated at a cold head. A temperature sensing and adjusting mechanism is coupled to a cold head for adjusting the temperature of the cold head in response to the change in heat flow in the cold head. The temperature sensing and adjusting mechanism comprises a temperature sensitive diode, a wound wire heater, and an electrical feedback control circuit coupling the diode to the heater.

40|$|Measurements of {{the drag}} {{and of the}} nacelle {{internal}} pressures on a wing and nacelle that housed a horizontally opposed piston engine {{were made in the}} 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel at Ames Research Center. These tests are follow-ons to earlier tests made with the same wing and nacelle but in which the engine was replaced with an electric motor and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>orifice</b> plate. In the initial tests the orifice plate was used to control the rate of cooling-air flow through the nacelle and thereby to simulate a range of gasoline engine types. Good agreement was found between the results of those tests and of the test reported here. Also, the upper and lower plenum pressure and cooling-air flow rate were found to be related by conventional equations used to represent the flow through orifices. Tests were run with three cooling air inlet sizes over a free-stream velocity range from 50 to 150 knots, an angle of attack range from 0 deg to 10 deg, and a cowl-flap deflection range from 0 deg to 30 deg. The data were analyzed by computing a flow coefficient similar to that used in the analysis of orifices. It was found that all of the flow coefficient values fell within a band that varied linearly with inlet area. The linear mean line through this band provides an estimate of the relationship between cooling-air flow rate and upper plenum pressure over a wide range of test conditions...|$|E
