50|$|The micro-alloy {{transistor}} (MAT) {{was developed}} by Philco as an improved type of <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistor,</b> it offered much higher speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{germanium}} <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistor,</b> or alloy transistor, was {{an early}} type of bipolar junction transistor, developed at General Electric and RCA in 1951 as an improvement over the earlier grown-junction transistor.|$|E
50|$|All {{types of}} <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistors</b> became {{obsolete}} {{in the early}} 1960s, {{with the introduction of}} the planar transistor which could be mass-produced easily while <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistors</b> had to be made individually. The first germanium planar transistors had much worse characteristics than <b>alloy-junction</b> germanium <b>transistors</b> of the period, but they cost much less, and the characteristics of planar transistors improved very rapidly, quickly exceeding those of all earlier germanium transistors.|$|R
50|$|The 7090 uses {{germanium}} <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistors</b> and (faster) germanium {{diffused junction}} drift transistors. More than 50,000 in all.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} diffusion transistors were diffused-base transistors. These transistors {{still had}} alloy emitters and sometimes alloy collectors like the earlier <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistors.</b> Only the base was diffused into the substrate. Sometimes the substrate formed the collector, but in transistors like Philco's micro-alloy diffused transistors the substrate was {{the bulk of}} the base.|$|R
50|$|The usual {{construction}} of an <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistor</b> is a germanium crystal forming the base, with emitter and collector alloy beads fused on opposite sides. There were several types of improved alloy-junction transistors developed {{over the years that}} they were manufactured.|$|E
50|$|The post-alloy {{diffused}} transistor (PADT), or post-alloy diffused-base transistor, {{was developed by}} Philips (but GE and RCA filed for patent and Jacques Pankove of RCA received patent for it) as an improvement to the germanium <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistor,</b> it offered even higher speed. It {{is a type of}} diffused-base transistor.|$|E
50|$|The surface-barrier {{transistor}} {{is a type}} of transistor {{developed by}} Philco in 1953 as an improvement to the <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistor</b> and the earlier point-contact transistor. Like the modern Schottky transistor, it offered much higher speed than earlier transistors and used metal-semiconductor junctions (instead of semiconductor-semiconductor junctions), but unlike the schottky transistor, both junctions were metal-semiconductor junctions.|$|E
2500|$|The first paper {{dealing with}} {{avalanche}} transistors was : the paper describes {{how to use}} <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistors</b> in the avalanche breakdown region, in order to overcome speed and breakdown voltage limitations which affected the first models of such kind of transistor when used in earlier computer digital circuits. Therefore the very first applications of avalanche transistors were in switching circuits and multivibrators.

5000|$|In the mid 1950s {{diode logic}} {{was used in}} the IBM 608 which was the first all-transistorized {{computer}} in the world. The image on the right shows two basic logic circuits packaged on 608 cards. They were designed using handmade germanium PNP and NPN <b>Alloy-junction</b> <b>transistors.</b> The PNP and NPN transistor symbols are those used by IBM. [...] These circuits were designed using all discrete components. A single card would hold four two-way circuits or three three-way or one eight-way. All input and output signals were compatible. The circuits were capable of reliably switching pulses as narrow as one microsecond.|$|R
500|$|In 1924, indium {{was found}} to have a valued {{property}} of stabilizing non-ferrous metals, and that became the first significant use for the element. The first large-scale application for indium was coating bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II, to protect against damage and corrosion; this is no longer a major use of the element. [...] New uses were found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of indium were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP <b>alloy-junction</b> <b>transistors.</b> In the middle and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid-crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest. By 1992, the thin-film application had become the largest end use.|$|R
50|$|The 7070 was {{implemented}} using both CTDL (in the logic and control sections) and current mode logic (in the timing storage and core storage sections) on Standard Modular System (SMS) cards. A {{total of about}} 30,000 <b>alloy-junction</b> germanium <b>transistors</b> and 22,000 germanium diodes are used, on approximately 14,000 SMS cards.|$|R

The introduction of the avalanche transistor served also as an application of Miller's empirical formula for the avalanche multiplication coefficient , first introduced in the paper : the need of better understanding transistor behavior in the avalanche breakdown region,not only for using them in avalanche mode, gave rise to an extensive research on impact ionization in semiconductors (see [...] ). From {{the beginning of the}} 1960s to {{the first half of the}} 1970s, several avalanche-transistor circuits were proposed, and also it was studied what kind of bipolar junction transistor is best suited for the use in the avalanche breakdown region: a complete reference, which includes also the contributions of scientists from ex-USSR and COMECON countries, is the book by [...] The first application of the avalanche transistor as a linear amplifier, named Controlled Avalanche Transit Time Triode, (CATT) was described in : a similar device, named IMPISTOR was described more or less in the same period in the paper of [...] Linear applications of this class of devices started later since there are some requirements to fulfill, as described below: also, the use of avalanche transistor in those applications is not mainstream since the devices require high collector to emitter voltages in order to work properly. Nowadays, there is still active research on avalanche devices (transistors or other) made of compound semiconductors, being capable of switching currents of several tens of amperes even faster than [...] "traditional" [...] avalanche transistors.|$|R
