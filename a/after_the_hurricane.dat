Buildings in Washington, D.C., remained closed for two days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> several people in central and western Maryland were injured with three killed from carbon monoxide due to improperly running generators in their houses. Additionally, others were injured due to chain saws and cleaning up debris. In the days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> the Calvert County Hospital reported an extra 130 patients per day.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Nova Scotia pledged $10million (2003 CAD) {{in relief}} money <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> hit, and private {{contributions}} were also made quickly {{after the storm}} hit. Prince Edward Island also pledged $200,000 (2003 CAD) immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> hit, {{and the federal government}} also announced their own package. The Mayor of Toronto at the time, Mel Lastman, also contributed $50,000 (2003 CAD) to replace damaged trees in Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} Oaxaca and Guerrero asked UNICEF for assistance, {{specifically}} water tanks, water pumps, and construction material. International aid initially focused almost {{solely on the}} damage in Acapulco. By a week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> 500communities in Oaxaca remained isolated and without assistance, with several large communities in Guerrero not receiving any material aid by a week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> The Adventist Development and Relief Agency organized about 7tons of food and clothing, and sent a bus of 40people to help isolated villages in southern Mexico. Around ten days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> struck, 20,000people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works, causing the president to suspect people could begin starving to death. Helicopters were initially sent to the remote areas, though severe fog and heavy rainfall <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> grounded the operations. The government worked to bring food to remote mountain communities, though officials noted the serious risk in doing so.|$|E

5|$|About 3,500 {{people were}} {{confirmed}} dead, with several thousands missing at one report five months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> It is estimated {{the passage of}} Hurricane Flora killed around 5,000 people and caused between $125million and $180million in damage in Haiti (1963USD).|$|E
5|$|Electricians had power {{restored}} to the Freeport area by {{the day after the}} storm, and had power {{restored to}} most of the western portion of the island within three weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs, and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000–4,000people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340kg (750lb) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico left many tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By about three weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least a week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas, which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{thousands}} of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations {{to the thousands}} left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to several days of power outages. By three weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai. By around a month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> passed the island, utilities were restored {{to most of the}} entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well. One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in Poipu, where the hurricane flooded areas several hundred feet inland. Hurricane Iniki struck the same area ten years later. Officials estimate a hurricane similar to Iwa striking Oahu in 1992 could cause up to $7.5billion in damage (USD).|$|E

5|$|Though {{initially}} {{perceived to}} be a potential threat to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September13, mitigating any evacuation procedures. Despite the storm's change in track, the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas. Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> recurved, the Weather Bureau advised caution to areas of the New England coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated. Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September16. The warnings were discontinued <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> passed the warned areas.|$|E

5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state.

By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about one month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Subsequent disaster declarations ultimately declared 47 North Carolina counties as disaster areas.

5|$|Hundreds of {{residents}} were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} the new inlet created by rising waters. Many parts of North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed or damaged, which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the Outer Banks. Sections of the highway were closed to one lane. The ferry between Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island was temporarily closed due to damage <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> though a small passenger ferry remained available for Hatteras Village residents and emergency workers. People who were not residents were not allowed to be on the Outer Banks for two weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> due to damaged road conditions.

5|$|In North Carolina, {{hundreds}} of residents were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} Isabel Inlet. People who were not residents {{were not allowed to}} be on the Outer Banks for two weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured to see the new inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6-km) walk from the nearest road. Initially, long term solutions to the Isabel Inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating the evolution of the Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, about a month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> struck. The United States Geological Survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane. On November 22, about two months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> struck, North Carolina Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened.|$|E
