5|$|Geologically, the Zarqa River {{is about}} 30 million years old. At the river's origin is 'Ain Ghazal, a major archaeological site {{that dates back}} to the Neolithic. Archaeological finds along the course of the river {{indicate}} the area was rich in flora <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> in the past. The Zarqa River is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous (135 m.y.). A remarkable flora <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007).|$|E

The doab (including the Terai) is {{responsible}} for the city's unique flora <b>and</b> <b>fauna.</b> Since the arrival of humans, nearly half of city's vertebrates have become extinct. Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced. Associated changes in habitat and the introduction of reptiles, snakes and other mammals led to the extinction of bird species, including large birds such as eagles.

5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora <b>and</b> <b>fauna,</b> Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.|$|E

All zones, and several of the subzones <b>and</b> <b>faunas,</b> have been identified elsewhere on Baltica as well as on other palaeocontinents, indicating that this zonation serves well as the standard zonation for calcareous successions. The average duration of the 24 Wenlock and Ludlow zones was 396 +/- 208 ka, using the latest radiometric timescale. However, most zones and subzones formed during the widely recognised Silurian oceanic events correspond to less time per unit - in the order of 30 to 100 ka - and most of those formed during intervening episodes correspond to a few 100 ka. The average duration of the 61 Wenlock and Ludlow zones, subzones, <b>and</b> <b>faunas</b> was only 156 +/- 82 ka, i. e., among the highest biostratigraphical resolution available for Phanerozoic epochs.

40|$|Antarctic {{biologists}} frequently {{emphasize the}} differences between the modern Antarctic environment <b>and</b> its <b>fauna,</b> <b>and</b> aquatic habitats <b>and</b> <b>faunas</b> elsewhere in the world. While it is valid to portray Antarctica as remote <b>and</b> its <b>fauna</b> as endemic <b>and</b> cold adapted, this approach tends to obscure broad scale similarities between Antarctic <b>and</b> non-Antarctic <b>faunas.</b> For example, the Antarctic fish fauna shares an evolutionary response to its habitat with fish in some tropical, temperate and boreal lakes. In this review we compare some well studied lacustrine radiations of fish with the two radiations of marine fish in the Antarctic Region of the Southern Ocean, notothenioids and liparids. We shall first make the case that, unlike other marine habitats, the Antarctic Region fulfills most of the essential parameters of lakes containing radiations of fish and that this large component of the world ocean is equivalent to a closed basin. Therefore in spite of its vastness, the Antarctic Region provides a comparable opportunity for studying evolutionary biology within a confined area. It is likely that notothenioids, and possibly liparids, are the first known examples of species flocks or radiations of marine fish. Thus the high Antarctic shelf and upper slope is an insular evolutionary site, with endemic faunas equally as interesting, but less well known, as those in ancient lakes throughout the world...|$|R
