40|$|Diminazene <b>aceturate</b> is a {{commonly}} used antibabesial agent. It has been postulated that diminazine may induce {{a decrease in}} blood pressure and exacerbate the hypotension presented in dogs with babesiosis. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of diminazine <b>aceturate</b> on the blood pressure of healthy dogs. Six healthy German shepherd dogs between 18 and 24 months of age with a mean weight of 30. 4 ± 2. 75 kg were used. Blood pressure was directly measured at the following time intervals: – 5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after treatment with diminazine <b>aceturate</b> (4. 2 mg/kg) intramuscularly. No statistical difference (P &gt; 0. 05) was found in blood pressure between any of the time intervals. An increase in heart rate was seen 5 minutes after the administration of diminazine <b>aceturate</b> but no {{change in blood pressure}} was evident. This study concluded that diminazene <b>aceturate</b> in its current formulation with antipyrine does not alter blood pressure in healthy adult dogs...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosomosis is a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} for dogs in Nigeria and treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> has steadily become less effective, either as a result of low quality of the locally available diminazene preparations or of drug resistance. To investigate these alternatives, samples of locally obtained drugs were analysed for diminazene <b>aceturate</b> content and a strain of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was isolated from a diminazene-refractory dog in Nsukka, south-eastern Nigeria, and used to infect albino rats. The quality of diminazene aceturate-based preparations was variable, with two preparations containing less than 95 % of the stated active compound. Rats infected with T. brucei isolated from the dog were treated 7 and 10 days after infection either with 7 mg/kg diminazene <b>aceturate</b> (intraperitoneally, once) or with 4 mg/kg pentamidine isethionate (intramuscularly, 7 consecutive days). Relapse rates were 100 % for both trypanocides in the groups of rat treated 10 days post-infection, and 83 % and 50 % of rats treated 7 days after infection relapsed to diminazene <b>aceturate</b> and pentamidine isethionate, respectively. Careful consideration of physiological parameters showed that pentamidine was only marginally superior to diminazene <b>aceturate</b> as applied in this study. It was concluded that dogs in Nigeria are infected with genuinely diminazene aceturate-resistant trypanosomes that appear to be cross-resistant to pentamidine isethionate...|$|E
40|$|Eleven {{groups of}} male cattle (39 on average per group) were {{monitored}} for presence of trypanosomes at 3 -weekly intervals for periods {{of up to}} 27 weeks at a feedlot of Ferkessedougou, northern Cote d'Ivoire, in an area supposedly free of tsetse. All animals originated from or grazed during transhumance in south west Mali. The groups were assigned to different treatment regimes {{as they enter the}} feed lot. All animals of six groups were treated with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> {{on the first day of}} sampling, three groups at a dose of 3. 5 mg/kg and three groups at 7 mg/kg body weight. Similarly three groups were treated with isometamidium chloride at a dose of 0. 5 mg/kg. As the feed lot ceased its operations, only one group was treated with the same drug at a dose of 1 mg/kg and an 11 th group was treated with homidium bromide at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Every animal was thus treated with either diminazene <b>aceturate,</b> isometamidum chloride or homidium bromide at the time of first sampling and with a "sanative pair" if detected parasitaemic again. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the one group initially treated with homidium. Five animals were detected parasitaemic at week 0 in two groups treated with isometamidium chloride at 1 mg/kg bodyweight. Two of these animals were detected parasitaemic again, one at 3 weeks and one at 12 weeks following treatment. Infections were then treated with dimianzene <b>aceturate</b> at 7 mg/kg body weight and apparently cured. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the other two groups treated with isometamidium chloride diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 3. 5 mg/kg, and in 2 of the 22 animals detected parasitaemic 3 and receiving diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 7 mg/kg body weight. There was 15 subsequent cases of parasitaemia in animals first treated with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight that were sampled on at least three occasions following further treatment with isometamidum chloride. Parasitaemia was detected again in 8 animals (53 percent) within 9 weeks of treatment. These results provide evidence of a problem of drug resistance to isometamidum having developed among trypanosomes in two of the eleven groups of animals. Diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight had apparently failed to cure infections in 14 animals in these two groups. there was however less evidence of drug failure when the higher dose of 7 mg/kg body weight was used in two other groups...|$|E

40|$|Six Boran cattle were {{infected}} with the drug-resistant Trypanosoma congolense IL 3338. At the first peak of parasitemia different groups of 200 teneral Glossina morsitans centralis were fed once on each animal, just prior to treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at a dose of 3. 5 mg kg- 1 body weight (b. w.). thereafter, all animals were monitored {{three times a week}} and retreated with the same drug dosage whenever the packed red blood cell volume (PCV) declined in three consecutive samples from {{one or more of the}} animals. After eight treatments at approximately two-week intervals the mean duration when parasites were not detected after each treatment did not increase, but remained at 7. 8 (+ or -) 1. 1 days. the mean PCV declined from 33. 2 (+ or -) 0. 6 percent at the time of the first treatment to a mean inter-treatment value of 23. 7 (+ or -) 2. 6 percent between the eighth at ninth treatment. Therefore, subsequent to the eighth treatment diminazene <b>aceturate</b> was administered as before but at a dose of 7. 0 mg kg- 1 b. w. After treatment with this higher dosage the mean inter-treatment PCV increased from 25. 4 (+ or -) 2. 4 percent following the first treatment to 32. 9 (+ or -) 1. 7 percent for the two-month period following the fifth treatment. At least 14 days after treatments with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 3. 5 mg kg- 1 b. w., and 30 days after treatments at 7. 0 mg kg- 1 b. w., similar numbers of flies as used for the first feed were fed on one occasion on each animal. Thereafter, 10 flies with mature infections from each group were fed individually on mice to determine the transmissibility index. In general, the midgut and hypopharynx infection rates in flies of all groups were not significantly lower than that of the control grouHowever, while tsetse groups that fed following the second and third treatments with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 7. 0 mg kg- 1 b. w. picked up infections from all six cattle, flies fed following the fourth treatment became infected from only two of the six animals. Thus, repeated treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at a dose of 7. 0 mg kg- 1 b. w. resulted in the apparent complete elimination of infection in four out of six animals. In contrast, the transmissibility index of T. congolense IL 3338 was not affected by multiple treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of trypanosomes resistant to diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at {{a dose of}} 25 mg/kg of body weight was investigated for populations of Trypanosoma congolense IL 3274 which reappeared in infected mice after intraperitoneal treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at the same dosage. At inoculum sizes of 10 (2), 10 (3), 10 (4), 10 (5), and 10 (6) trypanosomes per mouse, the relapse populations were used to initiate infections in five groups of 100 mice each by the intravenous route. Immediately after infection, 50 mice in each group were treated intraperitoneally with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at the aforementioned dosage; the other 50 mice functioned as untreated controls. Thereafter, all animals were monitored for 100 days {{for the presence of}} trypanosomes. In each group, trypanosomes were detected in 50 of 50 control mice, indicating 100 % infectivity for all five inoculum sizes. In contrast, in the groups of 50 mice infected with 10 (2), 10 (3), 10 (4), 10 (5) and 10 (6) trypanosomes and treated with diminazene <b>aceturate,</b> trypanosomes were detected in 4, 11, 13, 28, and 39 of 50 mice, respectively. By logistic regression, a good fit was found between the number of mice identified as parasitemic and the inoculum sizes. Maximum likelihood estimates for the proportions of trypanosomes resistant to diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 25 mg/kg of body weight for the inoculum of 10 (2), 10 (3), 10 (4), 10 (5), and 10 (6) organisms were 8. 335 x 10 (- 4), 2. 485 x 10 (- 4), 3. 02 x 10 (- 5), 8. 3 x 10 (- 6), and 1. 6 x 10 (- 6), respectively. These finding indicate {{that the majority of the}} relapse trypanosomes were susceptible the the drug dosage used for selecting the population and that, surprisingly, the calculated proportion of organisms which survived drug exposure varied inversely with the inoculum size. Further experiments with mice indicated that the inverse relationship did not result from alterations in the pharmacokinetics of the drug with different inoculum sizes. The data therefore suggest that parasite inoculum size and drug dosage are important factors in estimating the apparent {{frequency of}} diminazene-resistant trypanosomes in populations of T. congolense occurring in vivo...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the prevalence of}} trypanosomiasis and the usefulness of diminazene <b>aceturate</b> and isometamidium chloride {{in the treatment of}} pigs infected with Trypanosoma brucei sub-group. Whole blood was collected from pigs kept in two disease endemic areas, with riverine and open savannah environments. The prevalence of trypanosomiasis was recorded at 8. 1 % in the riverine environment as compared to the 2. 1 % in the open savannah environment and the infections in the former were significantly higher (P < 0. 001). All pigs that received a treatment of isometamidium chloride (Samorin®) at 1 mg/kg body weight did not show relapse when followed up to one month post treatment using microscopy. However, relapses were recorded among pigs treated with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> (Berenil®) at a dose rate of 7 mg/kg body weight and no relapses were recorded in those treated with 14 mg/kg body weight. From this investigation, it is apparent that the trypanosome prevalence among pigs kept under the riverine environment is higher than those kept under the open savannah. In addition, 1 mg/kg and 14 mg/kg isometamidium chloride and diminazene <b>aceturate</b> respectively should be adopted for the treatment of trypanosome infections among the pigs in the trypanosomiasis endemic areas...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of diminazene <b>aceturate</b> in the control of the infection by Trypanosoma evansi in cats.

Seven of the infected cats were used as positive control (group B) and seven were treated with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> (3. 5 mg kg(- 1)) or 5 consecutive days (group C). Biochemical and hematological parameters were evaluated during the experiment. Blood with anticoagulant was collected at day 49 post-inoculation and preserved in ethanol for DNA extraction. Samples were analyzed using PCR T. evansi-specific to assess the effectiveness of treatment. the treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> had an efficacy of 85. 7 %. Alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, urea, and creatinine values remained within the normal physiological range in the treated cats. Hemogram was normalized in all the cured animals.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the impact of hyperglycaemia on the trypanocidal efficacy of diminazene <b>aceturate.</b> Groups of alloxan-induced diabetic rats infected with T. brucei and T. congolense were treated with diminazene <b>aceturate,</b> and trypanocidal effects compared with normal non-diabetic controls. Results showed that the prepatent period was shorter in the diabetic (11. 25 ± 1. 65 days) than non-diabetic-T. congolense (15. 0 ± 1. 73 days), and also variations in responses to the trypanocidal therapy between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were detected. Parasite clearance time {{did not differ significantly}} between the diabetic and non-diabetic (43. 2 ± 8. 89 versus 52. 8 ± 8. 89 hours in T. brucei and 33. 6 ± 5. 9 versus 36. 0 ± 6. 93 hours in T. congolense, respectively).

Eflornithine (DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine [DFMO]; Ornidyl; Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio) has been used successfully against this protozoan disease in limited clinical trials, although not all patients respond to therapy. In contrast, results of the only reported experiments with DFMO in an animal model were negative. We retested DFMO against P. carinii in an immunosuppressed rat model by inclusion of 3 % DFMO in the drinking water, a dose rate about twice that used previously. A combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, a proven anti-P. carinii agent, {{was used as a}} positive control. After 3 weeks of anti-P. carinii pneumonia therapy, the surviving rats were sacrificed and the degree of parasitosis was judged by examination of lung sections stained with silver methenamine to reveal cysts. In three separate experiments, DFMO showed definite anti-P. carinii pneumonia activity; the parasitosis of DFMO-treated animals was significantly less than that of control animals (P less than 0. 001 for all experiments).

40|$|Bovine {{trypanosomosis}} is {{a serious}} constraint to livestock development in large parts of Mozambique. In most areas where tsetse flies are present, the disease in livestock is controlled using curative and prophylactic trypanocidal drugs. Those drugs {{have been used for}} many years and new drugs are unlikely to become available in the near future. As a result, trypanosomes have developed resistance against the currently available trypanocidal compounds. Drug resistance has been detected in various African countries and {{is a serious}} impediment to the control of livestock trypanosomosis. A study was initiated to determine whether drug resistant trypanosome strains are present in Zambézia Province of Mozambique. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the sensitivity of Trypanosoma congolense isolates from Chinde, Nicoadala and Maganja da Costa Districts to diminazene <b>aceturate,</b> isometamidium chloride and homidium chloride. To assess the effect of the farming system and the intensity of drug regimens on the development of drug resistance, trypanosome isolates were collected from cattle from subsistence, semisubsistence and commercial livestock production systems. Drug-use practices in each of the production systems were determined using a questionnaire. The methodology used to assess the level of drugs resistance in the trypanosome isolates was the standardized method described by Eisler et al. (2001). Seven isolates were selected for resistance testing. For each of the seven isolates, five different doses varying between 0. 01 - 20 mg/kg body weight for isometamidium chloride, 0. 01 - 10 mg/kg body weight for homidium chloride and 1 - 30 mg/kg body weight for diminazene <b>aceturate</b> were used. For each dose rate six mice were treated intraperitoneally with the appropriate quantity of the drug dissolved in 0. 2 ml of sterile distilled water 24 hours after the inoculation of the blood containing the trypanosomes. The control mice (six mice per trypanocidal drug) received the same amount of water without the drug. In four of the seven isolates high levels of multiple drug resistance (diminazene <b>aceturate</b> and isometamidium chloride) were detected. One isolate had a low level of multiple (diminazene <b>aceturate</b> and isometamidium chloride) drug resistance. Two isolates were susceptible to both diminazene <b>aceturate</b> and isometamidium chloride. One of those was highly susceptible to isometamidium chloride even at the lowest dose rate. The observed levels of drug resistance could in most cases be correlated to the drug-use practices in the particular livestock production system. The results obtained from homidium chloride treatment are not conclusive, because most the mice cured after receiving 10 mg/kg body weight of the drug. Hence more research is required to establish the homidium threshold in mice. The results of this study should be useful to define the strategy of disease control in places where resistance of trypanocide were been reported.

The goats in the first group were treated with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at a dose of 7. 0 mg kg - 1 body weight within 10 seconds of infection; one of the goats was cured. All of the second group, which received no treatment, became parasitaemic. The third group of goats recieved the same dose of drug as the first group but three days after all of them were first detected parasitaemic; trypanosomes reappeared in all the five goats. When this third group was treated, the frequency of trypanosomes resistant to the drug dosage was estimated to be less than one in 10 cube. The parasites which reappeared after the treatment of these animals were used to infect two additional groups of five goats intravenously. The goats in one group were treated with the same dose of drug as before, within 10 seconds of infection and were all cured.

All the isolates contained only Trypanosoma brucei and/or T. vivax. In naïve Boran (Bos indicus) cattle the isolates exhibited low pathogenicity and were sensitive to diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight (bw) and isometamidium chloride at 0. 5 mg/kg bw. In goats, 5 of 8 isolates were highly pathogenic, producing clinical signs indicative of central nervous system involvement within 60 days of infection; all such isolates contained T. brucei. However, all 8 populations were sensitive in goats to diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 3. 5 mg/kg bw. In contrast, 4 populations were refractory to treatment with isometamidium chloride at 0. 5 mg/kg bw in at least 1 out of 3 goats each.

Four in vitro tests were employed in drug sensitivity assessment: (1) Long Term Viability Assay (20 days) with insect forms at 27 C, (2) 3 H-Hypoxanthine Incorporation Test (48 hrs) with bloodstream forms at 340 C, (3) Drug Incubation Infectivity Test (DIIT) with bloodstream forms at 370 C and (4) Drug Incubation Survival Test with bloodstream forms at 340 C. All tests were able to show an antitrypanosomal effect of both, isometamidium chloride and diminazene <b>aceturate</b> on T vivax in vitro. The antitrypanosomal effects were detected by rounding and death of epimastigotes, inhibition of 3 H-Hypoxanthine incorporation by bloodstream forms, loss of infectivity to mice and {{reduction in the number of}} survivors.

The reduced sensitivity of epimastigotes of CP 2171 to isometamidium in vitro was similar in cultures initiated from these cattle compared with results obtained in cultures initiated from cattle infected with the original stabilate...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of late-stage human African trypanosomiasis {{is complicated by}} a post-treatment reactive encephalopathy, {{also referred to as}} a ‘reactive arsenical encephalopathy’, that may be fatal. This study used a well established experimental mouse system to assess the use of the trypanostatic drug, eflornithine, in the management of this post-treatment reaction. Female CD- 1 mice infected with an eflornithine-resistant trypanosome stabilate and treated with the trypanocidal compound diminazene <b>aceturate</b> on or after day 21 post-infection develop a reactive encephalopathy and relapsing parasitaemia. If these animals are re-treated with diminazene <b>aceturate,</b> a severe encephalopathy develops histologically comparable with that of human cases and characterized by a severe meningoencephalitis and astrogliosis. Histopathological and immunocytochemical examination shows that administration of eflornithine before or after the development of this reactive encephalopathy prevented or ameliorated the inflammatory reaction. Since an eflornithine resistant stabilate was used, this effect appears to be independent of the drug's trypanostatic action and illustrates an important, previously unrecognized, pharmacological property of eflornithine. Consideration can now be given to the use of eflornithine for the management of human trypanosomiasis cases, even where trypanosome resistance to eflornithine exists...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to apply transition models to distinguish between factors associated with both incident and persistent trypanosome infections. Data collected from 1561 cattle were analyzed from a long-term study involving 8 herds in which both trypanosome infections (a total of 56, 931 cattle sampling-months) and tsetse (Glossina spp.) challenge were monitored monthly from March 1986 to March 1998. Both pour-on and insecticide-target tsetse control programs and mass treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> before tsetse control were associated with significant decreases in both incidence and persistence of trypanosome infection relative to noncontrol periods, as were seasonal and sex effects. The magnitudes of the effects were, however, often different for new and persistent infections. For persistence of infection, there were 2 trends. In general, the duration of infection increased during the study, despite the regular treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate.</b> The transition model had 2 major benefits. The first was to identify an increasing duration of infections with time, taking into account other factors associated with increasing infection risk. The second was to highlight different patterns in the effects of certain factors on new and persistent trypanosome infections...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the duration after treatment of cattle with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> {{that the drug}} influences the tsetse infectivity and transmissibility of a drug-resistant Trypanosoma congolense, six Boran cattle were infected with T. congolense IL 3338 via the bites of Glossina morsitans centralis. At the first peak of parasitaemia, different groups of 120 teneral G. m. centralis were fed on one occasion on each animal, 1 h before treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at a dose of 3. 5 mg kg- 1 body weight. Thereafter, on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 21 after treatment, six different groups of 120 teneral G. m centralis were similarly fed on each animal. After 28 days maintenance on uninfected goats, all the flies were probed onto slides at 37 degree centigrade to identify those extruding metacyclic trypanosomes. Flies with mature infections from each group were then fed on one occasion on individual mice to {{determine the}} transmissibility index. After dissection of flies on Day 30 after their feed on the cattle, the mean mature ((+ or -) SE) infection rates in the seven groups of flies were 32. 1 (+ or -) 2. 2, 1. 0 (+ or -) 0. 7, 0. 4 (+ or -) 0. 4, 0. 5 (+ or -) 0. 3, 20. 0 (+ or -) 1. 7, 33. 3 (+ or -) 2. 2 and 23. 4 (+ or -) 2. 0 percent for flies fed on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 21 after treatment with diminazene, respectively. The transmissibility rates for the seven groups ranged from 94 to 100 percent. Thus, when cattle were infected with a diminazene-resistant T/ congolense, treatment with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> caused a substantial reduction {{in the ability of}} the trypanosomes to establish mature infections in tsetse for at least the first 7 days after treatment. In contrast, no significant effect on the transmissibility of the parasites to mice was observed at different intervals after treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} {{study was conducted}} within a cattle ranch in Gabon to determine the diminazene <b>aceturate</b> (Berenil) index (DAI) {{in a group of}} Zebu, raised under low tsetse density; this measure providing an assessment of trypanosomiasis risk. The objective was to evaluate the trypanosomiasis pressure thus informing trypanosomiasis control methods and cattle management. Twenty female adult Zebu were monitored for 24 weeks during the dry season. Blood samples were collected on a weekly basis and subjected to parasitological and haematological analysis (n = 480), using the buffy-coat method and the packed cell volume value (PCV), respectively, infected animals were treated with a single intramuscular injection of diminazene <b>aceturate</b> (8 mg/kg). Twenty-nine single infectious events were recorded and a DAI of 1. 45 was calculated. Two trypanosome species were identified: Trypanosoma congolense (96. 2 %) and Trypanosoma vivax (3. 8 %). The mean PCV value of the infected animals was lower (26. 6) compared to non-infected animals (32. 0). This study shows that DAI may be a useful tool to assess trypanosomiasis. However, this is a time-consuming method that may be improved by using randomly selected sentinel animals to adapt the chemoprophylactic schemes, hence decreasing the costs and the drug resistance risk...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{infected}} with Trypanosoma congolense developed a severe anaemia I week after infection, which persisted till treatment with diminazine <b>aceturate</b> when the {{packed cell volume}} (PCV) recovered to pre-infection levels. This {{was accompanied by a}} marked increase in the plasma levels of the acute phase proteins (APP), serum amyloid P-component (SAP) and haptoglobin (Hp). The initial peak levels of Hp and SAP were attained 7 and 12 days post-infection (DPI), respectively. Thereafter SAP levels decreased significantly to near pre-infection levels, but later increased even after treatment to give a second peak 34 DPI after which there was a decline till the study was terminated. The Hp levels on the other hand decreased to an intermediate level after the initial peak increasing to a second peak 22 DPI. Thereafter Hp decreased significantly following diminazine <b>aceturate</b> treatment to reach pre-infection levels within 5 days post-treatment. This indicates that T. congolense-infected mice develop severe anaemia accompanied by an acute phase response leading to an increase in SAP and Hp but that following treatment divergent responses occurred indicating differences in the pathways for stimulation of the APP. Haptoglobin was shown to be an earlier indicator of infection and a better marker in monitoring the response to treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of cross-resistance among melarsoprol-resistant Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense isolates {{was investigated in}} this study. The isolates, T. b. rhodesiense KETRI 237, 2538, 1992, 2709, 2694 and 3530, had been obtained from sleeping sickness patients in Kenya and Uganda between 1960 and 1985. Five groups consisting of six mice each were inoculated intraperitoneally with 105 parasites of each isolate, and 24 h later treated with either melarsoprol, homidium chloride, diminazene <b>aceturate</b> or isometamidium chloride. The control group comprised infected but untreated mice. The mice were monitored for cure {{for a period of}} 60 days post-treatment. The mean prepatent period in the control mice was 5 days while the mean survival period was 22 days. Five of the stabilates, KETRI 237, 2538, 2709, 2694, and 3530, were confirmed to be melarsoprol resistant. Cross-resistance was observed, with the majority of the isolates being resistant to homidium chloride (5 / 6) and diminazene <b>aceturate</b> (5 / 6), but all were sensitive to isometamidium chloride (6 / 6). However T. b. rhodesiense KETRI 1992, which was previously considered as melarsoprol resistant, was sensitive to all the drugs tested. In conclusion, our study has revealed the existence of cross-resistance among the melarsoprol resistant isolates which could only be cured by isometamidium. </span...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} trial {{was designed to}} evaluate the effects of diminazene <b>aceturate</b> and its stabiliser antipyrine on serum pseudocholinesterase (PChE) and red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC AChE) in dogs with babesiosis. The trial was conducted on naturally occurring, uncomplicated cases of babesiosis (n = 20) that were randomly allocated to groups receiving a standard therapeutic dose of diminazene <b>aceturate</b> with antipyrine stabiliser (n = 10) or antipyrine alone (n = 10). Blood was drawn immediately before and every 15 minutes for 1 hour after treatment. Plasma PChE showed a 4 % decrease between 0 and 60 min within the treatment group (p &lt; 0. 05). No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the treatment and control groups at any of the time intervals for PChE. There was an increase in RBC AChE activity at 15 min in the treatment group (p &lt; 0. 05). No {{significant differences were found between}} the treatment and control groups at any time interval for RBC AChE. In view of the difference in PChE, samples from additional, new cases (n = 10) of canine babesiosis were collected to identify the affect of the drug over 12 hours. No significant depression was identified over this time interval. The results suggests that the underlying mechanism in producing side-effects, when they do occur, is unlikely to be through cholinesterase depression...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} combined administration of a low dose of a phenolicsrich fraction of Khaya senegalensis (PFKS) stem bark with α-tocopherol on Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. brucei brucei) infection. Methods: Rats were divided into five groups of six animals, namely, normal control, uninfected but treated with PFKS and α-tocopherol, infected control, infected and treated with PFKS and α-tocopherol (ITTF) and infected treated with diminazine <b>aceturate.</b> Rats in infected control, ITTF and infected treated with diminazine <b>aceturate</b> were infected with T. brucei brucei while the animals in uninfected but treated with PFKS and α-tocopherol and ITTF were treated {{with a combination of}} PFKS (100 mg/kg body weight) and α-tocopherol (100 mg/kg body weight) for 8 days. At the end of the experiment, indices of anemia as well as hepatic and renal functions were analysed. Results: The combined treatment significantly (P < 0. 05) retarded the proliferation of T. brucei brucei in the infected animals compared to the infected group but could not completely eliminate the parasites from the bloodstream of infected animals. Furthermore, the trypanosome-associated pathological changes such as anemia, hepatic and renal damages were significantly (P < 0. 05) alleviated by the combination of PFKS and α-tocopherol. Conclusions: Combination of a low dose of PFKS stem bark and α-tocopherol could be a therapeutically active regimen against animal trypanosomiasis...|$|E
40|$|Anaemia and immunosuppresion {{have been}} shown to be a {{cardinal}} feature in African try-panosomosis. In this study, we have evaluated and compared the capacity of two registered veterinary trypanocides Novidium ® (homidium chloride) and Berenil ® (diminazene acetu-rate) to reduce haematological and biochemical lesions in rats experimentally infected with T. brucei. Packed cell volume (PCV), lymphocyte and eosinophil values in infected negative control group were significantly different and lower compared to positive control group as well as infected animals treated with homidium chloride and diminazene <b>aceturate</b> (P< 0. 05). Also the white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts in the negative control group were lower and significantly different from the other groups indicating evidence of infection-induced immunosuppresion. Haematological indices in infected rats treated with homidium chloride and diminazene <b>aceturate</b> were higher (P< 0. 05) than obtained in infected negative control group and significantly different from positive control (P< 0. 05). Total protein and albumin concentrations in infected negative control group were higher and significantly dif-ferent from control and treated animals (P< 0. 05). In contrast, significantly lower values were obtained for albumin concentrations in treated animals compared to both negative and posi-tive control groups (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of seven populations of T. congolense to the salts of three trypanocides, diminazene, isometamidium and homidium, were determined in vitro using in vitro-derived metacyclic trypanosomes. The trypanosomes were incubated at 35 degree centigrade for 48 hours with various drug concentrations (0. 5 ng- 50 ug/ml) and {{then transferred to}} cultures containing bovine endothelial-cell monolayers, to assess their viability over the following 5 days as compared to control trypanosomes that had been incubated without drug. The sensitivity to each drug was expressed as the minimum effective drug concentration which killed 100 percent of the trypanosomes in a given population within the 5 days. Using this assay, population IL 1180, characterised as being highly sensitive to all three drugs in vivo, required 10 ng/ml isometamidium chloride, 50 ng/ml homidium bromide or chloride and 5000 ng/ml diminazene <b>aceturate</b> to kill the entire population in vitro. In contrast, two derivatives of IL 1180 in which resistance to isometamidium had been induced in mice, IL 3343 and IL 3344, required isometamidium chloride at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml and 2000 ng/ml, respectively, to eliminate the populations. The in vitro {{results showed that the}} increase in level of resistance to isometamidium in these populations was associated with at least a 200 -fold increase in resistance in both populations to homidium, but no increase in resistance to diminazene. KE 2887 and CP 81, two isolates expressing high levels of resistance to both isometamidium and homidium in mice and cattle, were both resistant in vitro to isometamidium chloride and homidium salts at 100 ng/ml. Furthermore, while the former population was resistant to 10 000 ng/ml diminazene <b>aceturate,</b> the latter was sensitive to 5000 ng/ml. IL 3274 and IL 3330, characterised as expressing high levels of resistance to all three drugs in vivo, were shown to be resistant to isometamidium chloirde and homidium salts at 1000 ng/ml, and to diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 10 000 ng/ml. Finally, the in vitro IC 100 (concentration of drug required to eliminate 100 percent of the population) results were consistent with the maximum amounts of each drug detected in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{traditional}} {{herds of}} cattle {{in the area}} of Boundiali, northern Cote d'Ivoire, were examined monthly from 1990 to 1992 for the presence of trypanosomes. The herds were randomised into 3 treatment groups, cattle in 4 herds received diminazene <b>aceturate</b> at 3. 5 or 7 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) when detected parasitaemic; cattle in 4 herds received isometamidum chloride at 0. 5 or 1 mg/kg when detected parasitaemic; and cattle in 4 herds homidium bromide at 1 mg/kg when detected parasitaemic. Thirty one percent of 236 cases that were parasitaemic and treated were parasitaemic at the next month's sample when treated with diminazene <b>aceturate</b> or within two months when treated with isometamidium chloride or homidium bromide. This percentage was much higher than the monthly incidence of new infections (mean 4 percent, 85 percent of infections T. vivax, 15 percent T. congolense) and suggested that approximately 27 percent of infections may have been drug resistant. Some animals continued to be detected parasitaemic over several months. In order to relate the number of detected parasitaemias to the number of spearate individual infections. an estimated new infection was defined as a case of parasitaemia preceded by at least two months without detection of the same species of trypanosome. The infections were then examined to determine the proportion that may have recurred. There {{were no significant differences in}} rates of recurrence of infection among the three drugs (20 / 68 (29 percent) for diminazene <b>aceturate,</b> 15 / 39 (38 percent) foor isometamidum chloride, and 18 / 62 (29 percent) for homidium bromie) or between different doses for each drug. However, when cattle greater than 36 months of age were compared with those less than 36 months of age, the mean treatment failure rate in the older cattle was half that in younger cattle (22 percent and 41 percent, respectively; x 2 = 8. 1, P< 0. 01). This implies that the overall failure rate of the drugs to cure infections presumably due to drug resistance, was compensated to some extent by an acquired immunity to trypanosomal infections as the animals grew older...|$|E
