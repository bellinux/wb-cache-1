40|$|Objective: Sharp {{division}} of the <b>A</b> 1 <b>pulley</b> is <b>a</b> time-honored technique {{for the treatment of}} flexor tendon entrapment; however, this procedure is not without complications. The anatomy of the <b>A</b> 1 <b>pulley</b> system has been carefully investigated. Knowledge of superficial anatomic landmarks can assist with demarcating the distal edge of the <b>A</b> 1 <b>pulley</b> and prevent damage to the critical <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley.</b> Methods: Nine fresh cadaveric hands were dissected with the aid of loupe magnification. On the basis of known anatomic landmarks of the proximal portion of the cruciate (C 0) pulley, percutaneous placement of a 25 -gauge needle 5 mm proximal to the palmar digital crease marked the distal extent of the trigger finger release. Sharp {{division of}} the <b>A</b> 1 <b>pulley</b> was performed with a scalpel until the needle was encountered, thus completing the release. Results: A complete release of the pulley was achieved in all specimens with preservation of the <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley.</b> No digital nerve or artery injuries were noted with open inspection of the flexor sheath. Conclusion: Percutaneous marking of the distal extent of the <b>A</b> 1 <b>pulley</b> is <b>a</b> safe and reliable method that not only ensures complete release of the <b>A</b> 1 <b>pulley</b> but also preserves the <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley.</b> The placement of a small gauge needle adds no morbidity to this minimally invasive technique...|$|R
5|$|An {{open and}} spacious ground floor {{respected}} the same traditional layout exemplified in Besakana and other Merina homes, including {{the presence of}} hearth stones in their customary corner. Following traditional construction practices, the roof three stories above was supported by an enormous andry (central pillar) that was given the name Volamihitsy ("Genuine Silver"). According to popular legend, this was made of a single rosewood tree trunk transported from the eastern rain forests. Recent archaeological excavations of the site during reconstruction have since disproved this account as the pillar {{was found to be}} a composite of fitted rosewood pieces rather than a single solid post. According to custom, the north-eastern corner pillar was the first to be erected. Its length necessitated the use of <b>a</b> <b>pulley</b> designed by Jean Laborde, the principal architect, to haul the trunk into place. When an accident occurred during the operation, the queen designated a Malagasy carpenter to manufacture a crane to complete the task. Thousands of the queen's subjects were forced to labour on the building's construction in lieu of paying cash taxes pursuant to a tradition called fanampoana. One historic source claimed that 25,000 subjects participated in the raising of the building's corner posts alone. The harsh working conditions were said to have been the cause of many deaths, although precise figures are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to <b>a</b> <b>pulley.</b> Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto <b>a</b> <b>pulley</b> that was suspended from the tower.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The correct {{diagnosis}} of <b>an</b> <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture is challenging for musculoskeletal radiologists. An <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture should in theory influence {{the shape of}} the proximal interphalangeal joint volar plate (VP) and the amount of bowstringing at level of the VP during finger flexion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform MRI with metric analysis of the VP configuration and VP bowstringing in cadaver fingers in the crimp grip position and to determine cut points for <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI in the crimp grip position was performed in 21 cadaver fingers with artificially created flexor tendon pulley tears (fingers with <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture n[*]=[*] 16, fingers without <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture n[*]=[*] 5). The distances of the translation of the VP relative to the middle phalanx base, the distances between the flexor tendons and the VP body, and the distances between the flexor tendon and bone (TB) were measured. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significantly lower VP translation distances and significantly higher VP tendon distances if the <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> was ruptured. <b>A</b> 2 TB and A 4 TB distances did not differ significantly in specimens with and without <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture. The optimal cut points for <b>A</b> 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture were <b>a</b> VP translation distance 1. 4  mm.

40|$|Closed digital annular <b>pulley</b> {{tears are}} <b>a</b> common injury within the rock {{climbing}} community. The {{most often used}} injury, partial or complete tears of the <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley,</b> occurs due to forceful contraction of the tendon with the fingers in a crimp grip position. The most common method of prophylactic and temporary fixation of <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley</b> tears is circumferential taping, wherein a piece of athletic tape is wrapped circumferentially around the finger {{at the level of}} the <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley.</b> This method has been shown to limit A 2 tears and minimize pain due to partial tears. Unfortunately, this method does not protect adjacent <b>pulleys</b> (<b>A</b> 1, A 3) at increased risk when taping the A 2. Schoffl et al. has proposed a new taping method known as "H-taping" which enables simultaneous protection of the A 1 -A 3 pulleys. [1] We investigate this taping method through biomechanical testing for prophylactic and temporary treatment of <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley</b> tears. Fourteen matched fresh-frozen cadaver hands with forearms were used in this study (50 - 98 y/o; mean 73 y/o). The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons were identified and sutured for loading. The <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley</b> of the index (IF), long (LF), ring (RF), and small (SF) finger were identified. The IF's compared intact vs. partially torn (50 %) <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulleys,</b> untaped. The LF's compared intact vs. torn A 2, taped. The RF's compared intact <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulleys,</b> aped vs. untaped. The SF's compared torn <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulleys,</b> taped vs. untaped. The "H-tape" was normalized to cover 75 % of the proximal phalanx and middle phalanx of each taped finger, respectively. Mechanical testing: A custom tensile testing fixture was designed to position the hand in a rock climbing crimp grip with the metacarpophalangeal joint flexed 60 degrees, the proximal interphalangeal joint flexed 90 degrees, and the distal interphalangeal joint hyperextended. Tendons were secured in a novel tendon clamp. An MTS Systems Mini Bionix load frame and 15 kN load cell were used for testing. A displacement controlled protocol (30 mm/min) was used. Specimens were loaded until failure. Ultimate tensile load was defined as the peak load prior to <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley</b> failure. Tekscan pressure sensors measured the amount of force at the fingertip. Imaging: Digital image correlation (DIC) and ImageJ were used on the index finger to calculate the amount of bowstringing prior to <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley</b> rupture. The intact pulley (IF) allows greater force to be applied to the tendon prior to failure (Intact 186. 86 N;Torn 151. 35 N) and permits a marginally greater force at the fingertip (Intact 56. 92 N; Torn 46. 36 N). Adding tape to the intact and torn pulley (LF) did not bring the torn pulley up to the level of <b>an</b> intact <b>pulley.</b> Adding tape to an intact (RF) or torn (SF) pulley does not allow for a greater applied force to the tendon (p= 0. 85 and 0. 57, respectively) or an increase in force at the fingertip (p= 0. 40 and 0. 49, respectively). There was no significant difference for the bowstringing between the intact and torn pulley for both the digital image correlation and ImageJ methods. H-taping does not allow for increased applied force to the tendon and does not increase the force at the fingertip in specimens with an intact <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley.</b> H-taping of <b>a</b> torn <b>pulley</b> does not increase the allowable applied force to the tendon or increase the force at the fingertip to the level of an intact <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley.</b> The results do not support H-taping as a prophylactic or temporary fixation measure against <b>A</b> 2 <b>pulley</b> injury...|$|R
