40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the gene and mRNA coding for the constant (C) region of the secreted form of the BALB/c mouse IgA immunoglobulin alpha heavy (H) chain has been determined. As in other immunoglobulins, the three C region domains of the alpha protein, C alpha 1, C alpha 2, and C alpha 3 are coded in separate exons. However, the hinge region of C alpha is not coded on a separate exon {{as it is in}} other hinge-containing immunoglobulins. Instead, the <b>alpha</b> <b>hinge</b> is coded as a 5 ' extension of the C alpha 2 exon, and we suggest that it may have evolved by duplication leading to incorporation of an acceptor RNA splice site into the coding portion of the C alpha 2 exon. Extensions of this concept could provide an explanation for duplications in the human alpha 1 chain...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we showed that antibodies directed to restricted sequences in the hinge domain of alpha-type triiodothyronine (T 3) receptor (TR) (aminoacids 150 - 166, 172 - 191, 144 - 162) selectively recognized and immunoprecipitated alpha-type TR in tissues. Furthermore, antibodies to peptide 172 - 191 (anti-alpha 172) strongly impaired T 3 binding to natural TR alpha. To get more precise informations {{on the ability of}} these antibodies to recognize the TR, alter TR properties and/or detect conformational changes in TR, TR alpha 1 was produced in E. coli as a non-mutated, non-fusion protein from a rat c-erb A alpha 1 cDNA inserted into pTrc 99 A vector. The recombinant cErb A alpha 1 protein, after solubilization with 5 M guanidine and progressive refolding, presented the main characteristics of TR alpha: unique or largely dominant band of 46 KDa in Western blots with the different anti-c-Erb A alpha antibodies;binding to DNA and to T 3. Binding to DNA was markedly attenuated by anti-alpha 144 but not by anti-alpha 150 and anti-alpha 172. Binding to T 3 was modified by anti-alpha 150 and -alpha 172 with different characteristics whether recombinant TR was previously bound to T 3 or not, and with marked differences in comparative studies with natural TR. When liganded to T 3, recombinant and natural TR alpha 1 presentthe same pattern of interaction with both antibodies : immunoprecipitation without any dissociation of T 3 by anti-alpha 150;marked dissociation of bound T 3 by anti-alpha 172. By contrast unliganded recombinantand natural TR are oppositely altered by these antibodies in their ability to bind T 3 : strong impairment restricted to anti-alpha 172 for natural TR, and to anti-alpha 150 for recombinant TR. Anti-alpha 144 did not interfere. These results lay emphasis on : II the existence andbiological relevance of different conformational states of TR <b>alpha</b> <b>hinge</b> domain, particularly whether TR is liganded or not to T 3 and whether it is in a nuclear environment or bacterially-produced; 2 / an important role of the C-terminal part of hinge domain for efficient hormone binding, this involving a region that overlaps the a 150 and alpha 172 sequences...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an IgA related protein Vla which {{occurred in the}} serum and urine of a patient with multiple myeloma. The protein was isolated from urine; it had a molecular mass of 70, 000 daltons. It was {{shown to be a}} two chain IgA half molecule, consisting of a deleted alpha heavy chain, with a molecular mass of 42, 000 daltons, which was disulphide linked to a normal kappa type light chain. Fabc fragments were produced from an unrelated myeloma IgA. These had the same biochemical properties as protein V 1 a, except for the absence of the disulphide linkage between the deleted heavy chains and the light chains. Protein Vla and the Fabc fragments could both be cleaved by IgA 1 protease from Streptococcus sanguis, which indicates the presence of the <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>hinge</b> region. An inventory of its antigenic determinants and their similarity to those of previously characterized F(abc) 2 fragments, indicates that protein Vla, like the Fabc fragments, contains the CH 1 and CH 2 domains, but lacks most of the CH 3 domain. The fact that cleavage by IgA 1 protease from S. sanguis yields a Fab fragment but fails to yield a CH 2 domain demonstrates that cleavage by the enzyme is not only restricted to the Pro 227 -Thr 228 bond in the IgA 1 hinge region...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of therapeutic antibodies to combat pathogens and treat {{diseases such as}} cancer is of great interest for the biotechnology industry. The recent development of plant-based expression systems has demonstrated that plants are well-suited for the {{production of}} recombinant monoclonal antibodies with defined glycosylation. Compared to immunoglobulin G (IgG), less effort has been undertaken to express immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is the most prevalent antibody class at mucosal sites and a promising candidate for novel recombinant biopharmaceuticals with enhanced anti-tumour activity. Here, we transiently expressed recombinant human IgA 1 against the VP 8 * rotavirus antigen in glyco-engineered deltaXT/FT Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Mass spectrometric analysis of IgA 1 glycopeptides revealed the presence of complex biantennary N-glycans with terminal N-acetylglucosamine present on the N-glycosylation site of the CH 2 domain in the IgA 1 alpha chain. Analysis of the peptide carrying nine potential O-glycosylation sites in the IgA 1 <b>alpha</b> chain <b>hinge</b> region showed the presence of plant-specific modifications including hydroxyproline formation and the attachment of pentoses. By co-expression of enzymes required for initiation and elongation of human O-glycosylation it was possible to generate disialylated mucin-type core 1 O-glycans on plant-produced IgA 1. Our data demonstrate that deltaXT/FT Nicotiana benthamiana plants can be engineered towards the production of recombinant IgA 1 with defined human-type N- and O-linked glycans...|$|R
40|$|Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that immunoglobulin A 1 (IgA 1) proteases may be factors in the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases, including meningitis, gonorrhoea, and destructive periodontitis. Bacterial IgA 1 proteases are therefore potential candidates as vaccines. In this study, IgA 1 proteases from 166 clinical isolates and reference strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus aegyptius were compared with regard to specific activity and pattern of enzyme inhibition by antisera raised against IgA 1 protease from nine selected strains of H. influenzae. A total of 93 % of H. influenzae strains and all H. aegyptius strains had detectable IgA 1 protease activity. The majority of strains cleaved a prolyl-seryl or a prolyl-threonyl peptide bond in the <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>hinge</b> region, whereas occasional H. influenzae strains possessed two separate IgA 1 proteases with these two specific activities. Of the 155 IgA 1 protease-producing strains, all except 12 could be {{assigned to one of}} 14 IgA 1 protease "inhibition types," each defined by a characteristic pattern of inhibition by the nine antisera. There was no correlation between IgA 1 protease type and biotype of the strains. However, among 92 encapsulated H. influenzae strains, a close correlation between capsular serotype and IgA 1 protease type was observed. With the exception of serotype f, strains of all capsular serotypes produced an exclusive antigenic type of IgA 1 protease. All 38 strains of serotype b produced IgA 1 protease of inhibition type 1, which was never demonstrated in non-encapsulated H. influenzae strains. These results facilitate the detection of an antibody response against specific IgA 1 proteases and are of practical value for a possible future vaccine against H. influenzae serotype b infections...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a combinatory antibody-antigen microarray for direct screening of multiple single-chain fragment variable (scFv) clones with no need for pre-purification or enrichment before screening. The straightforward workflow allows for early selection of binders to predefined peptide and glycopeptide targets. A capture antibody is contact printed on microarray slides, {{side by side with}} the antigens of interest. A large number of scFv clones, in supernatants, are printed on top of the capture antibody and the antigen in a "spot-on-spot" print. The printed scFv clones, which bind to the capture antibody, are detected using biotinylated antigen, while the binding of scFv clones to the printed antigen is detected through a mouse anti-tag antibody. Two different analyses are thus performed on the same slide, generating two kinds of information: one on the ability of an individual scFv clone to bind to the soluble form of the antigen, which may favour selection for higher affinity rather than avidity, while the other allows the identification of large numbers of clones, simultaneously, due to the binding of scFv clones to densely presented antigens, thus providing an overall increased hit rate. The functionality of the new screening approach was illustrated through the generation of antibodies against peptides from the chaperone complex Ku 70 /Ku 80 and the GalNAcÎ±-serine/threonine epitope on the IgA 1 <b>alpha</b> chain <b>hinge</b> region. In total, 659 scFv clones were screened with a hit rate of approximately 20 %. This approach allowed the identification of functional antibodies in both cases, illustrating the usefulness and capacity of this combinatory microarray screening technique for efficient analysis and validation of antibodies at an early stage of antibody generation...|$|R
