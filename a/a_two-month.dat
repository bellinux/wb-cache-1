The following week, Carlito was defeated by Cena.|$|E
5|$|His second {{assignment}} was to Shanghai, where he officially served as vice-consul between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932, though <b>a</b> <b>two-month</b> temporary detail {{kept him in}} the city long enough to witness the Shanghai Incident firsthand.

Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol, Pleven, Karlovo, Plovdiv, Pazardzhik, Perushtitsa, Stara Zagora, Chirpan, Sliven, Lovech, Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sevlievo and Tryavna. According to some researchers, Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour, but those assumptions are based on uncertain data.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} a North American tour supporting {{one of their}} main influences, Yes, in summer 2004, Dream Theater took <b>a</b> <b>two-month</b> break.

5|$|After the {{publication}} of issue 6 in August 2012, Vaughan announced that the series would take <b>a</b> <b>two-month</b> hiatus, after which the first six-issue story arc was published in trade paperback form in October for $9.99 before the series' return in November, a practice that Vaughan and Staples would continue after each successive story arc and trade paperback publication. That same month, Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con, their first appearance together since the series' debut. Some retailers refused to display the trade paperback because its cover (a reuse of the first issue's cover) depicts Alana breastfeeding Hazel.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a step back from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions.

Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople by {{this stage}} was underpopulated and dilapidated. The {{population}} of the city had collapsed so severely that it was now {{little more than a}} cluster of villages separated by fields. On 2 April 1453, Sultan Mehmed's army of 80,000 men and large numbers of irregulars laid siege to the city. Despite a desperate last-ditch defence of the city by the massively outnumbered Christian forces (c. 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreign), Constantinople finally fell to the Ottomans after <b>a</b> <b>two-month</b> siege on 29 May 1453. The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, was last seen casting off his imperial regalia and throwing himself into hand-to-hand combat after the walls of the city were taken.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with <b>a</b> <b>two-month</b> boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E

5|$|Hammonds did {{not play}} professionally in 1992 as he competed for the United States {{national}} baseball team in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Hammonds struggled with the national team initially, but agreed to sign with the Orioles in July 1992, receiving a $975,000 signing bonus, the largest of any player chosen in that draft. Upon signing, his hitting improved.|$|E

50|$|In {{the twentieth}} stage, Fausto Coppi won and {{took some time}} back. His fans were hoping that he would show more action on the twenty-first stage which {{included}} the Bernina Pass, but cyclists rode slowly {{as a form of}} protest against the racing conditions, taking almost ten hours to cover the 222 km stage; this event became known as the Bernina strike. When the race ended in Milan the next day, angry supporters whistled at the cyclists. For his leading role in the strike, Coppi was given <b>a</b> <b>two-months</b> suspension, although this was later revoked.|$|R
