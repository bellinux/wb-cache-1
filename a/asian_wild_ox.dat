The king of Cornouaille proved to be the only person able to lift the body and place it on a bier, which healed his arm of an old wound.

40|$|While {{studying}} {{the collection of}} recent oxen of the Museum my attention {{was drawn to the}} problem of the nomenclature of the Java banteng. I believe {{to have been able to}} clear up the confusion that still exists today, as will be set forth in the present note. The <b>wild</b> <b>ox</b> of Java, the banteng, is known variously as Bos sondaicus or Bos banteng, but neither of these is the earliest available valid name. The species should have been called: Bibos javanicus (d'Alton) B[os] Javanicus d'Alton, Skelete der Wiederkäuer, Bonn, 1823, p. (7), pl. VIII fig. c. The earliest reference to the banteng of Java I have been able to find is in Pennant (1800, p. 35) : "Mr. Loten told me that <b>wild</b> <b>oxen,</b> of a reddish brown color, with vast horns, and of a great size, are found in Java". Raffles, in his oft quoted "History of Java" refers to the <b>wild</b> Javan <b>ox</b> as "bánteng" (Raffles, 1817, p. 49; 1830, p. 56) or "bánteng" (Raffles, 1817, p. III; 1830, p. 123), but these are vernacularisms, as are "Bentinger" as used by Boie and Macklot (1827, p. 316) and "Bantinger" (Fischer, 1829, p. 500). In February, 1821, two adult banteng skeletons from Java were sent to Leiden by Reinwardt, one male, and the other female. In the handwritten list of specimens of Reinwardt's consignment preserved in the archives of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden these skeletons are marked as of the <b>wild</b> Javan <b>ox</b> or Bantinger, Bos javanicus. The skulls of these specimens were figured for the first time by d'Alton (1823, pl. VIII figs, c and d), who, in the explanation of the plate, indicates the male (his fig. c) as "Schadel des Javanischen zahmen Ochsen (B. Javanicus, Reinwardt) "...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses called on God to bless the Tribe of Joseph with dew, the yield of the sun, crops in season, {{the bounty of}} the hills, and the favor of the Presence in the burning bush.

25|$|Another {{source for}} the concept may have {{originated}} from the translation of the Hebrew word re'em into Greek as μονόκερως, monokeros, in the Septuagint. In Psalm 22:21, the word karen, meaning horn, is written in singular. The Roman Catholic Vulgata and the Douay-Rheims Bible translated re'em as rhinoceros; other translations are names for a <b>wild</b> bull, <b>wild</b> <b>oxen,</b> buffalo, or gaur, but in some languages a word for unicorn is maintained. The Arabic translation alrim is the most correct choice etymologically, meaning 'white oryx'.|$|R
