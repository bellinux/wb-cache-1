40|$|Selling <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> is {{a social}} praxis {{commonly}} found in daily activities. Traditional selling <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> is generally conducted in local language or dialect. Banyumas dialect or Banyumasan is a non-standard variation of Javanese language spoken along the Serayu River. Traditional selling <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> in Banyumas, consequently, is conducted in Banyumas dialect. Language plays important role in traditional selling <b>and</b> <b>buying.</b> In addition to its referential functions, phatic functions emerge from its practice. Referential functions are realized when language is used to achieve referential things such as goods and services. On the other hand, phatic functions are gained when language is used to initiate, maintain, and end a conversation. Phatic functions are very specific to traditional selling <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> which is rarely found in modern selling <b>and</b> <b>buying.</b> In modern selling <b>and</b> <b>buying,</b> seller <b>and</b> buyer may not {{be involved in a}} real conversation since goods exchange still occurs without any language exchange. This article proves the functions of phatic expressions in traditional selling <b>and</b> <b>buying.</b> It employs qualitative research method and conversational analysis to find the functions of phatic expressions. Based on the analysis, phatic expressions in traditional selling <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> in Banyumas dialect are mainly functioned for greeting, thanking, asking condition, showing surprise, emphasizing, and ending a conversation. ...|$|R

5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the deaths}} of two further partners, Backhouse in 1879 and Turnbull in 1880, Storey bought their shares to become the Echos chief proprietor. A year later, in 1881, he met Scottish-born millionaire Andrew Carnegie, and formed a {{syndicate}} with him to set up new newspapers <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> up others. Among those purchased were the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the Northern Daily Mail in Hartlepool and the Portsmouth Evening News. An attempt to buy the Shields Gazette, the country's oldest daily newspaper, failed. The syndicate finally broke up in 1885, with Storey retaining control of the Echo, Hampshire Telegraph, Portsmouth News and the Northern Daily Mail. These papers {{formed the basis of}} a new company, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, formed in the 1930s. The 19th century ended with the rivalry between the Echo and the Sunderland Daily Post intensifying. The Silksworth Colliery strike of 1891 pitted the two papers against each other, with the Post attacking Storey for having exploited the strike for political gain. Storey successfully sued for libel.|$|E
5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E

5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E
5|$|Michael's domain in Epirus {{became a}} refuge and centre of {{resistance}} of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At about the same time, according to some modern scholars, he may have led the abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras; according to other views, he may have led a campaign there between 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> time to consolidate his position in Epirus, Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of Epirus to Michael and his descendants.|$|E

Chapman continued to reshape his team <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> players to fit his desired system. He led Arsenal to their first major trophy, as they beat his former side Huddersfield Town 2–0 in the 1930 FA Cup Final. The team continued to mature and won the 1930–31 First Division title, scoring 127 goals in the process. Chapman won another championship in 1932–33, after Arsenal ended the previous season as league and 1932 FA Cup runners-up.|$|E

5|$|The Caribbean {{initially}} provided England's {{most important}} and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits. Colonies in St Lucia(1605) and Grenada(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts(1624), Barbados(1627) and Nevis(1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships {{would be able to}} ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas {{at the expense of the}} Dutch. In 1655, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas.|$|E
