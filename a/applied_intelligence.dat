2500|$|Ray Kurzweil is an {{inventor}} and serial entrepreneur. When The Age of Spiritual Machines was published {{he had already}} started four companies: Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. which created optical character recognition and image scanning technology to assist the blind, Kurzweil Music Systems, which developed music synthesizers with high quality emulation of real instruments, Kurzweil <b>Applied</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> which created speech recognition technology, and Kurzweil Educational Systems, which made print-to-speech reading technology. Critics say predictions from his previous book The Age of Intelligent Machines [...] "have largely come true" [...] and [...] "anticipated with uncanny accuracy most of the key computer developments" [...] of the 1990s. After this book was published {{he went on to}} expand upon its ideas in a follow-on book The Singularity is Near. Today Ray Kurzweil works at Google where he is attempting to [...] "create a truly useful AI [...] that will make all of us smarter".|$|E
60|$|The whole {{trend and}} purpose of this book from the outset has been to insist upon the mental quality of Socialism, to {{maintain}} {{that it is a}} business of conventions about property and plans of reorganization, that is to say, of changes and expansions of the ideas of men, changes and expansions of their spirit of action and their habitual circles of ideas. Unless you can change men's minds you cannot effect Socialism, and when you have made clear and universal certain broad understandings, Socialism becomes a mere matter of science and devices and <b>applied</b> <b>intelligence.</b> That is the constructive Socialist's position. Logically, therefore, he declares the teacher master of the situation. Ultimately the Socialist movement is teaching, and the most important people in the world from the Socialist's point of view are those who teach--I mean of course not simply those who teach in schools, but those who teach in pulpits, in books, in the press, in universities and lecture-theatres, in parliaments and councils, in discussions and associations and experiments of every sort, and, last in my list but most important of all, those mothers and motherly women who teach little children in their earliest years. Every one, too, who enunciates a new and valid idea, or works out a new contrivance, is a teacher in this sense.|$|E

5000|$|Weak {{artificial}} intelligence (weak AI), {{also known as}} narrow AI, is non-sentient {{artificial intelligence}} that is focused on one narrow task. Weak AI is defined in contrast to either strong AI (a machine with consciousness, sentience and mind) or artificial general intelligence (a machine {{with the ability to}} <b>apply</b> <b>intelligence</b> to any problem, rather than just one specific problem). All currently existing systems considered artificial intelligence of any sort are weak AI at most.|$|R

50|$|The {{field of}} {{intelligence}} employs analysts {{to break down}} and understand {{a wide array of}} questions. Intelligence agencies may use heuristics, inductive and deductive reasoning, social network analysis, dynamic network analysis, link analysis, and brainstorming to sort through problems they face. Military intelligence may explore issues through the use of game theory, Red Teaming, and wargaming. Signals <b>intelligence</b> <b>applies</b> cryptanalysis and frequency analysis to break codes and ciphers.
