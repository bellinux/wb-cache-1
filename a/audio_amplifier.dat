Launched circa 1978, this highly affordable product delivered a good quality sound, which acquired a reputation as an audiophile amplifier of exceptional value.

50|$|Until the {{invention}} of solid state devices such as the transistor, all electronic amplification was produced by valve (tube) amplifiers. While solid-state devices prevail in most <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> today, valve <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are still used where their audible characteristics are considered pleasing, for example in music performance or music reproduction.|$|R
50|$|Dynaco {{introduced}} the following tube <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> tuners, and preamplifiers between 1955 and 1976.|$|R
25|$|The {{practical}} {{amplifier circuit}} {{to the right}} could {{be the basis for}} a moderate-power <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier.</b> It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB push–pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.|$|E
25|$|Since it is {{designed}} to turn on and off rapidly, amplifiers that use it often synthesize complex waveforms with pulse-width modulation and low-pass filters. In switching applications modern devices feature pulse repetition rates well into the ultrasonic range—frequencies which are at least ten times the highest audio frequency handled by the device when used as an analog <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E
25|$|In most {{amplifiers}} {{a reduction}} in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; {{the result is a}} compression effect, which (if the amplifier is an <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier)</b> sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the 1nbsp&dB compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1nbsp&dB less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.|$|E
50|$|Valve <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{typically}} {{amplify the}} entire audio range between 20 Hz and 20 kHz or higher. They use an iron core transformer {{to provide a}} suitable high impedance load to the valve(s) while driving a speaker, which is typically 8 Ohms. <b>Audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> normally use a single valve in class A, or a pair in class B or class AB.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{transistor}} <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{of up to}} a {{few hundred}} watts are common and relatively inexpensive.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{frequency}} ranges for <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and RF amplifiers overlap, {{the class of}} operation, method of output coupling and percent operational bandwidth will differ. Power valves are capable of high frequency response, up to at least 30 MHz. Indeed, many of the Directly Heated Single Ended Triode (DH-SET) <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> use radio transmitting valves originally designed to operate as RF amplifiers in the high frequency range.|$|R
25|$|The {{first use}} for the diode was the {{demodulation}} of amplitude modulated (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose amplitude or envelope {{is proportional to the}} original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) rectifies the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple filter and fed into an <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> or transducer, which generates sound waves.|$|E
25|$|The gain of an {{amplifier}} is {{the ratio}} of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in decibels. (When measured in decibels it is logarithmically related to the power ratio: G(dB)=10 log(Pout /(Pin)). RF amplifiers are often specified {{in terms of the}} maximum power gain obtainable, while the voltage gain of audio amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers will be more often specified (since the amplifier's input impedance will often be much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance). For example, an <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> with a gain given as 20dB will have a voltage gain of ten (but a power gain of 100 would only occur in the event the input and output impedances were identical).|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, {{the number of}} {{consumer}} electronic devices in most homes greatly increased, along {{with the number of}} remotes to control those devices. According to the Consumer Electronics Association, an average US home has four remotes. To operate a home theater as many as five or six remotes may be required, including one for cable or satellite receiver, VCR or digital video recorder (DVR/PVR), DVD player, TV and <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Several of these remotes may need to be used sequentially for some programs or services to work properly. However, as there are no accepted interface guidelines, the process is increasingly cumbersome. One solution used {{to reduce the number of}} remotes that have to be used is the universal remote, a remote control which is programmed with the operation codes for most major brands of TVs, DVD players, etc. In the early 2010s, many smartphone manufacturers began incorporating infrared emitters into their devices, thereby enabling their use as universal remotes via an included or downloadable app.|$|E

50|$|Continuous average {{sine wave}} power ratings are {{a staple of}} {{performance}} specifications for <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and, sometimes, loudspeakers.|$|R
50|$|Logarithmic taper potentiometers {{are often}} used in {{connection}} with <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> as human perception of audio volume is logarithmic.|$|R
500|$|The {{impedance}} of {{a loudspeaker}} is not constant across all frequencies. [...] In a typical loudspeaker the impedance will rise {{with increasing frequency}} from its DC value, {{as shown in the}} diagram, until it reaches a point of its mechanical resonance. [...] Following resonance, the impedance falls to a minimum and then begins to rise again. [...] Speakers are usually designed to operate at frequencies above their resonance, and for this reason it is the usual practice to define nominal impedance at this minimum and then round to the nearest standard value. [...] The ratio of the peak resonant frequency to the nominal impedance can be as much as 4:1. [...] It is, however, still perfectly possible for the low frequency impedance to actually be lower than the nominal impedance. [...] A given <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> may not be capable of driving this low frequency impedance even though it is capable of driving the nominal impedance, a problem that can be solved either with the use of crossover filters or underrating the amplifier supplied.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> amplifies audio frequencies. This {{category}} subdivides {{into small}} signal amplification, and power amps that are optimised to driving speakers, sometimes with multiple amps grouped together as separate or bridgeable channels to accommodate different audio reproduction requirements. Frequently used terms within audio amplifiers include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The gain of a {{good quality}} {{full-range}} <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> will be essentially flat between 20Hz to about 20kHz (the range of normal human hearing). In ultra-high-fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more octaves either side) and might have [...] points < 10nbsp&Hz and > [...] Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond {{too much of the}} amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies, and the danger of AM radio interference would increase. Modern switching amplifiers need steep low pass filtering at the output to get rid of high-frequency switching noise and harmonics.|$|E

50|$|Key design {{parameters}} for <b>audio</b> power <b>amplifiers</b> are frequency response, gain, noise, and distortion. These are interdependent; increasing gain {{often leads to}} undesirable increases in noise and distortion. While negative feedback actually reduces the gain, it also reduces distortion. Most <b>audio</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are linear amplifiers operating in class AB.|$|R

2500|$|Constant-voltage speaker systems {{refer to}} {{networks}} of loudspeakers which {{are connected to}} an <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> using step-up and step-down transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only {{in the sense that}} at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems. [...] In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100V.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "Arcade game" [...] {{generally}} {{refers to}} a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated cabinet which has one built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a CRT screen, and <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating {{to the theme of}} the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s, video arcades were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them.|$|E

2500|$|Most home hi-fi {{loudspeakers}} use two wiring {{points to}} connect {{to the source of}} the signal (for example, to the <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier</b> or receiver). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have binding posts, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper electrical polarity (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −; [...] speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be [...] "out of phase" [...] or more properly [...] "out of polarity". Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.|$|E
2500|$|Headphones (or head-phones in {{the early}} days of {{telephony}} and radio) are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers that are designed to be worn on or around the head over a user's ears. [...] They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones are designed to allow a single user to listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air, for anyone nearby to hear. [...] Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones or, colloquially, cans. Circumaural and supra-aural headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place. [...] The other type, known as earbuds or earpieces consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. [...] In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an <b>audio</b> <b>amplifier,</b> radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a cord, or using wireless technology such as bluetooth or FM radio. [...] The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by telephone operators, to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high fidelity headphones.|$|E
