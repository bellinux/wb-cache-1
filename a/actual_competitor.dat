We first estimate demand functions for P&G and competitor brands from the period before value pricing was initiated. We then formulate a dynamic manufacturer-retailer Stackelberg model that includes P&G, a national-brand competitor, and a retailer. The model takes P&G's move as given and prescribes the price and promotion response of the competitors and the retailer. We substitute the estimated demand parameters into the model to obtain prescriptions for each competitor and the retailer, and see whether these prescriptions {{are related to the}} actual response. We find that the dynamic game-theoretic model calibrated with empirical estimates of demand parameters has significant predictive power. We also test the predictive power of two benchmark models. The first is based on the reaction function approach of Leeflang and Wittink (Leeflang, Peter S. H., Wittink, Dick R. 1992. Diagnosing competitive reactions using (aggregated) scanner data. 39 – 57.), and the second is a simplification of our dynamic model where the retailer is not strategic.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{relationships}} between {{two different types of}} human communication: mobility - i. e., communication with movement - and motionless communication, sometimes also called virtual mobility. The aim of the study has been to carry out an analysis of modern motorised mobility around the world, considering the evolution of ITS. The final goal has been to provide an added value to the numerous publications already available on daily mobility, by outlining common elements and pointing out the role of being connected in future transport systems, in this way contributing to the pursuit of "interconnected transport systems": the Latin root of intelligent has two meanings, one of which is interconnect (inter-lego). An analysis on the long-term evolution of the main transport mode, that is, by car, has pointed out that an economic cycle has been completed in most motorised countries: this also complies with historical theories on the subject. However, new motionless communication systems have appeared on the market over the last decade, and they have become <b>actual</b> <b>competitors</b> to motorised mobility or, hopefully, collaborators. Therefore, a new cycle of cars would be possible, under certain conditions - one of which includes being connected - a requirement that this paper wishes to outline with the help of some numerical analyses...|$|R

40|$|Antitrust {{rules have}} been brought into play in {{situations}} whereby a company tries to prevent, or at least delay, the entry into the market of potential competitors. This issue has become strikingly prominent {{in the context of}} patents and intellectual property (IP) rights in the pharmaceutical industry. Patent holders of a drug, or drug originators, sometimes enter into a ‘reverse payment agreement’ with generics manufacturers, which involves paying the latter to settle prospective patent litigation. The sum agreed might also cover delaying the entry of the generic version of the drug into the market (‘pay-for-delay’ settlement). Delaying the entry of would-be competitors would almost certainly entail pushing back the benefits typically derived from a competitive market, the very ones that competition law was designed to protect. And yet the fact remains that, when reverse payment agreements are entered into, the generics manufacturers are not <b>actual</b> <b>competitors</b> of the patent holder. Unless they infringe the IP rights of the originator, the generic version of the drug will only hit the market once the basic patent is no longer in force. To what extent, therefore, should the application of competition extend to a future threat which may never materialise?

After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the Monster Hunter series. With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share in a meaningful way, selling almost 80 million units in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's Game Boy Advance had during the sixth generation of video game consoles.

On the February 14, 2013 edition of Impact Wrestling, the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Lockdown was determined through a tournament designed to allow the competitors to impress TNA General Manager Hulk Hogan, enabling him to personally select the number one contender. Out of the four matches scheduled, two resulted in a no-contest (Kurt Angle versus Samoa Joe and Bobby Roode versus Austin Aries). In the other matches, Magnus defeated Christopher Daniels and James Storm beat Rob Van Dam. Meanwhile, Brooke Hogan spoke with her father, Hulk Hogan, about her husband Bully Ray wanting {{to compete for the}} championship, which Hulk said he would take under advisement. On the same night, before a decision regarding the title contender could be made, the Aces & Eights gang halted the announcement by surrounding Hogan for an attack, but retreated when Bully Ray and Sting came to Hogan's aid with weapons. The next week, in a decision seen as an act of nepotism, Hogan chose his son-in-law Bully Ray, who did not partake in the tournament, as the number one contender to the World Title, disregarding the <b>actual</b> <b>competitors</b> in the tournament.The ninth annual Lethal Lockdown match took place at Lockdown to showcase the main feud in TNA. This year, for the first time, instead of the cage ceiling (with weapons attached) lowering to indicate the start of the final phase of the Lethal Lockdown match, weapons were brought to the match, where pinfalls and submissions were legal ways to win once all participants had entered. For over 9 months, the masked gang Aces & Eights, beginning with their attacks on Sting and Hulk Hogan, had waged war against TNA and the company's roster through a mixture of all-out brawls and calculated attacks. After holding Sting and Hogan for ransom (in a deal to free attorney Joseph Park, who worked for Hogan to investigate the mysterious gang), Aces & Eights received their chance to win [...] "full access" [...] to the promotion after defeating Sting and Bully Ray on October 14 at Bound for Glory, where a major member of the biker gang was revealed to be Devon, who later cited his groupies, a contract dispute, the anonymous leader of the group who patched him in, and Bully Ray mistreating him and his children in the past as his reasons for joining. Over the next few months, the unmasking and revelations of Aces & Eights members occurred leading to Aces & Eights challenging the TNA roster to [...] "a war to end all wars" [...] at Lockdown. In the following weeks, Aces & Eights assembled their team, captained by Devon. Along with Devon, this team included D.O.C., Mr. Anderson, Mike Knox and Garett Bischoff, and they were to fight against Team TNA captained by Sting which was revealed to include James Storm, Samoa Joe, Magnus, and a returning Eric Young, who was injured months ago by the Aces & Eights.|$|R

40|$|Using the Lanchester {{model to}} {{describe}} {{the dynamics of the}} market where two firms compete for customers by advertising, we solve the problem of determining an optimal advertising strategy for maximum discounted profits. We develop both open- and closed-loop strategies and explain the relationship between them. Using a new mathematical approach, we prove that our closed-loop solution is a global Nash equilibrium. The closed-loop strategy is time-variant and depends linearly on the actual market share. The time-variant coefficient incorporates the discount factor, its computation requires the solution of a backward differential equation and a set of two nonlinear differential equations for an initial value problem. The closed-loop advertising expenditures are proportional to the open-loop advertising expenditures and to the square of the <b>competitor's</b> <b>actual</b> market share. This provides a very practical adaptive control rule that allows the manager to adjust the actual advertising expenditure and to deviate from budget.

Our goal is to show how and why firms are, at once, structured by the inherited configuration of capital and also reproduce differentiation {{within and outside the}} corporation. To do so, we use concepts and principles drawn from modern financial theory to show that a spatially differentiated configuration of production may have advantages for the firm in terms of the risk-adjusted flow of revenue, strategic options in relation to <b>actual</b> and potential <b>competitors,</b> and the management of sunk costs. Our argument focuses on the modern corporation, characterized by a separation between ownership and control as well as a dependence upon internal stakeholders for the realization of planned revenue and output targets. We argue that our framework can help theorists account for the persistence of interfirm and interindustry differences in capital profiles, despite a common presumption in favor of convergence around a simple, efficient industry standard.

Trap-jaw ants in the genus Odontomachus have a rapid and powerful mandible snap that is used during predation to disable fast or dangerous prey. Previous research suggests that some trap-jaw species may have co-opted the high forces generated by the mandibles for escape: in threatening situations ants direct their strikes against the substrate and launch themselves into the air. Until now, no <b>actual</b> predators or <b>competitors</b> have been found in the field against which trap-jaw use their “escape jumps. ” Here, I examine the use of mandible snapping behavior in two trap-jaw species (Odontomachus brunneus and Odontomachus relictus) during their interactions with predatory antlions in the genus Myrmeleon. Using behavioral observations, high-speed videography, and traditional bioassays, I describe how trap-jaw ants can use their mandible strikes to escape from antlion pits. Interestingly, while both species use the mandible snap for predation, only O. brunneus use the mandible snap to escape from antlion pits. A comparison of the kinematic properties of mandible strikes suggests that differences in force generation might contribute to the behavioral differences between these species. Taken together, my results indicate that trap-jaw mandible snaps can be used to escape from natural predators, lending support to the idea that this predatory behavior has been evolutionarily co-opted for anti-predator defense...|$|R

By contrast, under the antitrust laws, a unilateral refusal to deal may constitute an element of a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and the courts may then impose a duty on the violator to deal with others, including possibly with its <b>actual</b> or would-be <b>competitors.</b> The central question addressed by this Article arises from an attempt to harmonize these potentially conflicting principles: What {{is the extent to which}} the antitrust laws may impose a duty to deal on the owner of intellectual property? Two recent court of appeals decisions have taken notably different approaches to this question. In Image Technical Services v. Eastman Kodak, the Ninth Circuit held that, in the absence of legitimate business justifications, the defendant, the owner of copyright and patent rights, violated the Sherman Act by its refusal to sell or license the products subject to intellectual property protection to its competitors. In In re Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation (Xerox), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit expressly disagreed with the Ninth Circuit and rejected the proposition that even in the absence of those justifications, the antitrust laws might impose a duty on the owner of patents or copyrights to deal with competitors. On several occasions, albeit not in the context of intellectual property, the Supreme Court has recognized that the antitrust laws may impose a duty on a firm with market power to deal with its competitors. However, last Term, in Trinko, the Supreme Court limited the reach of some of those prior decisions.
