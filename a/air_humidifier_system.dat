A relationship between the effect of cevimeline on saliva secretion and the degree of salivary gland destruction evaluated by sialography and histopathological findings in the labial minor salivary glands has been reported. These diagnostic approaches could provide useful prognostic information on the efficacy of cevimeline in Sjögren's syndrome patients. Concomitantly, a bite guard was suggested as an effective lubricating device because it maintains the lubricants in the proper location. In addition, the {{management of}} the complications of dry mouth, such as tooth caries, periodontitis and oral candidiasis, which all lead to a reduction in the QOL, is also important.

40|$|The {{durability}} {{and performance of}} commercially available polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology depends heavily on adequate humidification of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Early generation automotive fuel cell stacks will likely rely on an external humidification process based on gas-to-gas membrane planar humidifiers to humidify the inlet cathode stream. The membrane-based <b>humidifier</b> <b>systems</b> allow the reactants to receive recycled heat and moisture from the cathode outlet stream. The objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} flexible, computer-based simulation tool {{that can be used to}} aid in the design of these planar <b>humidifier</b> <b>systems.</b> The simulation is based on fundamental mass transfer concepts and experimental membrane behaviour based on literature results. It was determined that the mass transfer resistance through the membrane is several orders of magnitude higher than the resistance contributed by the gas diffusion media (GDM) and thus the mass transfer resistance through the GDM are not considered. An important point to note is that the Schroeder’s Paradox observed in perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes implies that membranes in contact with liquid water will exhibit higher mass transfer than membranes in contact with saturated water vapour despite the fact that the water activity in both situations are unity. Initial simulations for which no liquid water was present resulted in a humidifier water transfer rate less than half the rate observed experimentally. Thus it was hypothesized that condensed liquid water was present on the wet-side of the humidifier membrane and as such this work assumes a fraction of the membrane surface is covered by liquid water while the rest of the membrane is exposed to gaseous water concentrations comparable to the bulk channel stream above the GDM. For typical operating conditions the outlet wet-side stream retains 92 % of the inlet water content and as such it was hypothesized that constant fractional liquid water coverage across the membrane could be assumed. Later simulations confirmed the validity of this hypothesis. Six models of water coverage estimation were derived using least squares and factorial design methods. The models were compared however no single method was determined to be superior for all situations as the methods exhibit similar sums of squared error...|$|R

40|$|Desiccant-based HVAC {{systems are}} {{nowadays}} a convenient alternative to conventional systems based on dehumidification by cooling, because they allow {{the reduction of}} equivalent CO 2 emissions, electric peak loads and black-outs, as well as energy savings, interesting payback periods in several cases, better indoor humidity control and air quality, separate control of thermal sensible and latent loads. Their coupling with small scale natural gas-fired cogenerators is also suitable as thermal energy required for desiccant regeneration can be conveniently recovered from the microcogenerator. In this paper, the main improvements of an innovative desiccant-based HVAC system, located in Southern Italy (Mediterranean climate), are presented. To this aim, three different desiccant system configurations are experimentally analysed, while a conventional HVAC system based on dehumidification by cooling is evaluated by means of numerical approach. Firstly, the primary energy savings (up to 20 - 25 %) and the reductions of equivalent CO 2 emissions (up to 40 - 50 %) of the desiccant systems compared to the conventional one are calculated when considering chillers with different energy efficiency ratio values.

Second, the continuous nebulizer was connected to the endotracheal tube.

Further clinical study with nebulizer positioned at 30, 45  cm above the Y-piece or at the inspiratory outlet of the ventilator is required. Third, quantification was performed based on counts derived from a single anterior planar image instead of a geometric mean of anterior and posterior counts that could decrease the accuracy of the quantification [23]. Safety concern imposed to avoid patient’s transfer to the examination table and posterior images of the lungs could not be acquired due to bed structure; this bias, if of any relevance, was, however, constant for all patients in both groups.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{any kind}} of {{ventilation}} systems is to ensure optimal comfort conditions of indoor air quality for inhabitants independently of outdoor air parameters. Until the end of 90 -ties all dwelling buildings in Latvia were equipped with mandatory natural ventilation systems with stack effect. Nowadays in many cases there is only exhaust mechanical ventilation in dwellings but air tight windows prevent natural air intake. The operation of existing ventilation systems is inefficient and result in bad IAQ. Installation of regular mechanical “inflow - outflow” ventilation systems in dwelling buildings was limited by such factors as high noise level during operation time, limited buildings’ area and high construction expenses. In order to improve the situation in existing multi –flats buildings new technical decisions are being introduced. One of such decisions is use of hybrid ventilation. The implementation of principles of hybrid ventilation systems in Latvia poses some difficulties due to climatic conditions. In general Latvian climate can be described by moderate temperatures with all year round high relative humidity. In order to ensure optimal comfort parameters of indoor air it is necessary to use not only air heating devices but also <b>air</b> <b>humidifiers.</b> The paper deals with Latvian average climate parameters on the basis of statistical data for 10 year time period. As the result optimal working regimes of ventilation systems are found. The paper studies the principles of the ventilation systems’ automatic control in any climatic conditions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether occupational exposure to raw tobacco causes respiratory or allergic diseases, {{an excess of}} respiratory symptoms, a decrease in lung function, or parenchymal changes in chest radiography among Finnish cigar workers. METHODS: This cross sectional study included all Finnish cigar workers (n = 106) exposed to raw tobacco and also a group of unexposed matched referents. Data were collected with a self administered questionnaire, flow volume spirometry, measurements of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, chest radiography and skin prick tests. A questionnaire was also sent to former workers of the factory. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chest radiography findings. Nine of 102 tobacco workers had pulmonary fibrosis of at least 1 / 0 (according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 1980 classification) and the corresponding figure was five for the referents. The tobacco workers tended to have a low forced vital capacity (FVC), and they had impaired forced expiratory volume in 1 second and lower means of the maximal expiratory flow at 25 % of the FVC significantly more often than the referents. Diffusing capacity tended to be lower among the referents. The referents more often had atopy and earlier atopic diseases than the exposed workers. These results indicate the possibility of selection among the exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: No excess of prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the tobacco workers was found. According to the questionnaire episodes of allergic alveolitis may have occurred in the cigar factory workers. However, in the absence of impairments in lung function and radiological changes it was not possible to distinguish humidifier fever and allergic alveolitis.

The engine model can be classified as a one-zone, zero-dimensional and includes sub-models for in-cylinder heat transfer, exhaust port heat transfer, heat release and the valve flow process. The turbocharger model is developed in steps {{and is based on}} a polynomial fit to experimental compressor and turbine performance data. Inlet and exhaust manifolds are treated as well-mixed volumes. A simplified model for the humidifier is adopted in order to simulate a humid air motor (HAM) concept. The whole engine system is zero dimensional and the different system components are linked by means of mean values for mass flow, temperatures, pressures and gas composition. The NASA-polynomials are used for calculating thermal and transport properties. The extended Zeldovich mechanism is used as an indicator of significant NO formation. The models are validated through comparisons with experiments on mainly diesel and HCCI engines, both cycle and system results. HCCI engine cycle simulations are made, showing the influence of various engine parameters e. g. compression ratio, engine speed, air-fuel ratio, exhaust gas recycling, inlet pressure and valve timing. Mainly natural gas and landfill gas are studied. The self-stabilizing feature of HCCI ignition timing is investigated using chemical kinetics.

METHODS [...] Symptoms from 88 factory workers were surveyed by a doctor administered questionnaire and compared with their serum IgG antibody titres to humidifier water contaminants quantified by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS [...] The strength of association between individual symptoms and antibody showed that fever, shivering or chills, influenza-like symptoms, or headache were individually significantly associated with the presence and higher titres of antibody. This was also true for those subjects whose symptoms were most pronounced during {{the first day of}} the working week. Within each subject's full symptom profile there were significant associations between the description of chest tightness, breathlessness, and wheeze; between headache and influenza like symptoms; between fever and shivering or chills; and between intermittent onset and general tiredness. Discriminant analysis of the full symptom profiles showed that there was maximum information content in five independent parameters, namely, the descriptions of fever, headache, and chest tightness, the timing of their onset, and the readiness to describe miscellaneous symptoms in addition to those in the questionnaire. On the basis of these criteria 72 % of subjects could be classified according to their antibody state. Cluster analysis with these five independent parameters described four symptom clusters: one associated with high median antibody levels, one with low, and two with zero median levels. These were, respectively: (1) fever with headache and chest tightness; (2) either no or few symptoms; (3) chest tightness and headache with intermittent onset; (4) headache and miscellaneous symptoms with intermittent onset.
