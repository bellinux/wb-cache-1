5|$|The {{first batch}} of {{herbicides}} was unloaded at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962. U.S. Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions {{took place over}} the course of Operation Ranch Hand. By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended U.S. Department of Agriculture <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> for domestic use. In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed. In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E

30|$|High N <b>application</b> <b>rates,</b> an {{important}} environmental factor, increases grain yield but decreases lodging resistance in rice plants by weakening the physical {{strength of the}} lower internodes (Wu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015). Zhang WJ et al. (2014) indicated that N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> decreased the breaking strength of culms by reducing bending stress in japonica super rice and decreasing section modulus in indica super rice. In wheat, Wei et al. (2008) suggested that the reduction of basal N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> reduced {{the length of the}} lower internodes but increased the culm diameter, the culm wall thickness and the breaking strength, reducing the lodging index, which was consistent with a previous report by Lu et al. (2014). Our data showed that the culm wall thickness varied little, and the culm diameter increased rapidly in both cultivars of japonica rice with an increase in top-dressing N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> (Table  1). However, the breaking strength was significantly reduced, which resulted in a higher lodging index (Fig.  1). These results are not consistent with previous reports (Ma et al., 2004; Kashiwagi et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009). It is reasonable that the morphological traits of the basal stem were influenced by solar radiation reaching to the stem base, which largely depends on the leaf area index (LAI) and maximum tiller number at the panicle initiation stage (Li 1979; Ling et al., 1994). In this study, the maximum tiller number and LAI at the panicle initiation stage were almost identical under different top-dressing N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> (data not shown); thus, the culm diameter might increase under higher N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> at the panicle initiation stage, which is consistent with the reports by Li et al. (2013) and Wu et al. (2015).|$|R

50|$|Implementation Considerations: Advantages of land farming include its {{simplicity}} and low capital cost, {{the ability to}} apply multiple waste loadings to the same parcel of land, and the potential to improve soil conditions. Concerns associated with land farming are its high maintenance costs (e.g., for periodic land tilling, fertilizer); potentially large land requirements; and required analysis, testing, demonstration, and monitoring.

40|$|Whole-crop wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as forage {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in the world. In this study, the effects of N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> on the yields, nutritive value and silage quality were investigated. The N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> were 0, 75, 150, 225, and 300 kg/ha. The research {{results indicated that the}} dry matter yield of whole-crop wheat increased significantly with increasing N rate up to 150 kg/ha, and then leveled off. The crude protein content and in vitro dry matter digestibility of whole-crop wheat increased significantly with increasing N up to 225 kg/ha, while they no longer increased at N 300 kg/ha. On the contrary, the content of various fibers tended to decrease with the increase of N application. The content of lactic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid in silages increased with the increase of N rate (p< 0. 05). The ammonia-N content of silages with higher N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> (≥ 225 kg/ha) was significantly higher than that with lower N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> (≤ 150 kg/ha). Whole-crop wheat applied with high levels of N accumulated more nitrate-N. In conclusion, taking account of yields, nutritive value, silage quality and safety, the optimum N application to whole-crop wheat should be about 150 kg/ha at the present experiment conditions...|$|R
40|$|Biosolids {{and meat}} and bone meal (MBM) are {{commonly}} used as fertilizers in agriculture, often at <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> where total phosphorus (P) far exceeds the annual demand. In a pot experiment, three biosolids and two types of MBM were tested at two commonly used <b>application</b> <b>rates.</b> Their contributions to P uptake in ryegrass (second and third season) were compared with annual mineral P fertilization. The soil was analysed for extractable P (PAL and POlsen). Only soil amended with digested, limed biosolids provided a P uptake in ryegrass the third season comparable to annual NPK fertilization. Bone-rich MBM had considerable contributions to third season P uptake in soil with pH < 6.
