5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> {{helicopter}} {{crash in}} 1999 {{resulting in the}} deaths of six Marines and one sailor, the US Navy performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other things that they needed a new search and rescue knife. The KA-BAR knives issued to the SBUs (Special Boat Units) had catastrophically failed to cut the Marines free from their webbing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> release of radioactivity.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>disastrous</b> as the 1996–97 {{season was}} for the Spurs, the offseason {{proved to be the}} opposite. With the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA's draft lottery, which gave them the top pick in the 1997 draft. The Spurs used their pick to select Wake Forest product and {{consensus}} All-American Tim Duncan.|$|R

5|$|The {{civil war}} spawned <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> {{humanitarian}} crisis in Angola, internally displacing 4.28million people – one-third of Angola's total population. The United Nations estimated in 2003 that 80% of Angolans lacked access to basic medical care, 60% lacked access to water, and 30% of Angolan children would die {{before the age}} of five, with an overall national life expectancy of less than 40years of age.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>disastrous</b> {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the {{lighthouse}} onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of king K'iq'ab in 1475 the K'iche' were engaged in warfare against both the Tz'utujils and the Kaqchikels, perhaps {{in an attempt to}} recover the former power of Q'umarkaj. A short time after {{the death of}} K'iq'ab, under the {{leadership}} of Tepepul, Q'umarkaj attacked Iximche, the capital of the Kaqchikels, and suffered <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> defeat that greatly weakened the K'iche'. After this Q'umarkaj never again directly challenged the Kaqchikels of Iximche. The next leader after Tepepul was Tekum, who was a son of K'iq'ab. who led the K'iche's against the Tz'utujils and was killed in battle near the south shore of Lake Atitlan.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Willkie {{made two}} wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's {{informal}} envoy, and as nominal {{leader of the}} Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{left the}} {{direction}} of the battle to subordinates, General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general for the greatest American victory of the war to date. He may have conspired with others to replace George Washington as the commander-in-chief. Instead, he received the command of the main American army in the South. He led it to <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field again.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chinese {{were unable}} to exploit the {{breakthrough}} in the UN lines, {{the weakness of the}} ROK II Corps on the Eighth Army's right flank was exposed to the Chinese commanders. During the planning of the Chinese Second Phase Campaign, Peng would again focus his attention towards the ROK II Corps at the Eighth Army's right flank, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> defeat for the UN forces at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, October 25 is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} in the face of <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} North Korean defense {{halted the}} Marines. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from U.S. tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's previously successful tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise failed in the face of massive U.S. numerical superiority.|$|E
5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E

5|$|But {{the emperor}} {{rejected}} an outright invasion. Just coming off <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> Japanese campaign, the emperor {{was unwilling to}} commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E
5|$|City were relegated again {{five seasons}} later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the 1928–29 season, they broke several club records to earn {{promotion}} back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they {{remained in the}} third and fourth tiers of the English football league system until 1985–86. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> fire in which 56people died, on a day the club and their fans were supposed to be celebrating promotion.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the engine}} issues, the SO2U-1 was {{considered}} overall {{to be superior}} to the competing Curtiss XSO3C-1; however, Vought's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U Kingfisher scout and F4U Corsair fighter. As a result, the XSO3C was declared {{the winner of the}} contract, and was ordered into production. Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the Royal Navy, the SO3C developed <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> reputation in service, and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace.|$|E

5|$|During the game's present, the war {{has ended}} but {{tensions}} are still high on both sides. The game's primary setting is the Okanos region at the Thirteen Towers, a giant fortress suspended above a giant chasm called the Scar, {{held in place by}} thirteen giant chains said to keep the Scar from growing. Initially built five centuries before, <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> magical experiment caused the Towers to be infested by monsters. Fifty years {{prior to the start of}} the game, a new experiment involving the monsters triggers the Scar's creation.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, <b>a</b> <b>disastrous</b> prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
