The German and Canadian infantry took cover from cross-fire as tanks on both sides were knocked out. The commander of the first Sherman saw that the German troops and tanks in the area were formed up for attack. Three half-tracks were seen parked together near infantry, who began running around in confusion <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>about</b> thirty more tanks also parked together were seen, then a battery of 88mm guns and more half-tracks. Three of the half-tracks were destroyed by the Sherman, which then caught fire.

25|$|The Jivamukti Yoga {{method of}} {{meditation}} is a mantra form of meditation, and follows a three-step procedure: choose a seat, be still, and focus. The mantra “Let-Go” is taught to all Jivamukti students, {{and provides the}} focus. The practitioner is instructed to align the silent repetition of the mantra with the incoming and outgoing breath. By witnessing the continuous movement of breath through the body and thought through the mind, Jivamukti teaches that the practitioner can eventually let go of identification with the body and mind and come to realize the supreme Self. The Jivamukti method holds realization of the supreme self or enlightenment {{to be the ultimate}} goal of yoga. The class usually begins with Sanskrit chanting; this is followed by detailed meditation instruction <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>about</b> 20 minutes of actual sitting practice. Afterwards there is a Q session with the teacher, and a final closing.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir {{had been}} prince of Novgorod {{when his father}} Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his {{half-brother}} Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, {{with the help of}} his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>about</b> the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.|$|E

After attempting to go out along [...] "the low road"—Bluff Creek Road—and finding it blocked by a mudslide, they went instead up the steep Onion Mountain Road, off whose shoulder their truck slipped; extracting it required the (unauthorized) borrowing of a nearby front-end loader. The drive home from their campsite covered about 580 miles, the initial 28.8 miles on a low-speed logging road, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>about</b> 110 miles on twisty Route 96. Driving a truck with three horses, and allowing for occasional stops, it would have taken 13 hours to get home Saturday evening, at an average speed of 45mph; it would have taken 14.5 hours at a 40mph average speed.|$|E

These people were extraordinary. You can see why they frightened the old guard, because they saw no boundaries. They {{wanted to build a}} palace, they built a palace. They wanted to buy a yacht, they bought a yacht. And the old guard in New York weren’t like that at all, and suddenly this whirlwind of couture descended on their heads. They redesigned being rich. They created a rich culture that we still have — people who are rich are rich {{in a way that was}} established in America in the 1880s, ’90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never have happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>about</b> 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another huge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made good money, they would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they’d have to look after Nanny. The Americans of the 1880s and ’90s didn’t want too much of that." ...|$|E
