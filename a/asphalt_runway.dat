5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{announced}} in February1993 {{that they were}} considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Widerøe articulated that Båtsfjord Airport {{did not meet the}} demands for future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an <b>asphalt</b> <b>runway.</b> Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash8, which would be phased in between 1993 and 1995, they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. The CAA stated, instead, that the new airport should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main reason was that the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including Båtsfjord.|$|E
5|$|Norving {{operated}} at {{the airport}} until 1990, when the route {{was taken over by}} Widerøe, who initially used the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). Along with Båtsfjord Airport and Vardø Airport, Svartnes, Hasvik Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government-subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants. In December Widerøe articulated that Hasvik Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an <b>asphalt</b> <b>runway.</b> Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. Additional navigation aids were installed in 1993 and the runway was asphalted in 1995, subsequently resulting in Dash 8 services being introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997.
