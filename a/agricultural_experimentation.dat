40|$|When {{planning}} a new {{intervention in the}} city with a complex and sometimes violent past, such as Sarajevo, the aspect of time is particularly important. The blooming of a landscape has not the same speed of the fast-changing urban conditions. There is an absence of synchronization. Agriculture and agricultural practices help shortening this gap, giving immediate meaning to these spaces, and offering a glimpse on the time passing. The {{goal is to make}} the space useful and meaningful, with the resources already present and very few time. Students and people from the neighborhood can engage with the soil from the first moment, work with it, try new techniques and learn from it. The area becomes a symbol for experimentation. The city is given an enclave, a cultural reservoir where experiments become useful not only to the students (in this case) but to the community in general. The spaces for agriculture are alternated to open lawns and public areas where inhabitants can spend time. In this way, experimentation is showcased to people and is likely to spread and rise interest. The site is, therefore, an open laboratory, immediately readable and comprehensible to all. The urban field is now a privileged area for diverse research in a public manner. This originates a new type of evocative space, an intermediate landscape between agriculture and public space, that may sparkle playful social practices, shared between different groups. The main goal underlying this type of space is firstly aesthetic but also scientific. Meanwhile, the surrounding area is planted with a growing forest resulting into a large intervention of reforestation. The produced urban space, this micro forest for <b>agricultural</b> <b>experimentations</b> set himself in a new relationship with nature. On one hand, we are in front of a process of re-appropriation by nature of the human space, on the other hand, man is engaging with the soil to benefit from it. Nor man, nor nature is now prevailing but we find ourselves in front of a process of action and reaction. The man observes and allows nature to develop and reacts to it only when its own survival sphere is touched. The site becomes now a metaphor for a laboratory dedicated to the relationship between man and its territory, in order to research how to reach a situation of balance. Landscape Architectur...|$|R

50|$|The University of Queensland Gatton Campus was {{established}} in 1897 at Gatton as the Queensland Agricultural College. The College initially operated as a tertiary agricultural institution offering a basic practical and theoretical agricultural education for young men and short courses for farmers on specific topics, but from its inception, {{there was also an}} expectation that the College would be involved in <b>agricultural</b> research and <b>experimentation.</b> In 1922, it was re-structured as the Gatton Agricultural High School and College. From 1927, the College also took students from the University of Queensland for a year of practical experience. During the Second World War, the College was used as a field hospital by the United States Army from 1942 to 1944. After the war, it continued to operate as both a secondary and tertiary institution until the high school section was closed in 1962. In the 1960s the college began to diversify the courses on offer and the first women students enrolled in 1969. In 1990, the College merged with the University of Queensland.|$|R
40|$|IT MAY be {{said that}} it took {{eighteen}} years to lay the foundation of agricultural instruction and research in Nebraska, and another eighteen years to build on this foundation. The eighteen years beginning about 1890 marked a period of great development for the Industrial College {{as well as the}} University itself. A School of Agriculture was early established and in a comparatively few years began to number its students in the hundreds. What the agricultural department of the Industrial College had heretofore lacked in numbers, this secondary school supplied. For the first time, the college farm began to be regarded as an educational center of its own. Then came its rapid development with the erection of several of the magnificent buildings of today. By 1909 agriculture had reached such importance in the Industrial College that a separate Agricultural College was once more established, with the farm campus for its headquarters. The University itself prospered greatly in these years, and this prosperity was reflected in the increasing development of the Agricultural College. The total enrollment in the University passed the 2, 000 mark in the academic year 1899 - 1900 and the 3, 000 mark in the year 1906 - 1907, these figures 2 ̆ 7 including students in all the schools and colleges. In 1899 it was stated that the University had students from as far west as California and as far east as Japan. More money for the support of the University and its Industrial College became available. The tax for the support of the University, which had been cut to a quarter of a mill and raised to three-eighths of a mill, during {{the early days of the}} University, was again restored to the full mill in 1899. <b>Agricultural</b> instruction and <b>experimentation</b> were benefited by the 2 ̆ 2 Second Morrill Act 2 ̆ 2 of 1890, the Nelson Amendment of 1907, and the Adams Act of 1906, all bringing more money to the agricultural side of the institution. Agricultural extension began to develop with scores _ of farmers 2 ̆ 7 institutes and short courses being held in every section of the state. Here we also find the beginning of home economics instruction for women, culminating in the latter part of this period in the erection of the home economics building on the farm campus. All in all, this was a period of development such as would hardly have been conceived to be possible in the eighties...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:      <b>Agricultural</b> R&D, field <b>experimentation,</b> crossbreeding, dairy, feeding technologies, mixed farming, farming systems research, modelling. Smallholder {{mixed crop}} {{livestock}} systems {{continue to be}} a dominant agricultural production system in many developing countries, including India. Dairy farming {{is part and parcel of}} many such systems, and it is often seen as an important livelihood option to increase household income and to therefore contribute to poverty alleviation in rural areas. As a result, substantial efforts in agricultural R&D have been directed towards design of new technologies for smallholder dairy farming. Variable success in technology transfer has clearly shown that adoption is context-specific, related to the physical and socio-economic environment, access of farmers to resources, access to information and personal attitudes. A series of concepts and methods were developed to incorporate these considerations, and to replace narrow technology-driven approaches by broader ones such as Farming Systems Research (FSR). This thesis describes and analyses experiences of BAIF, an Indian NGO, with the use of FSR methodology in livestock development programmes in Gujarat, India. The objectives were to identify criteria and methodologies for selection of appropriate livestock technologies for farm level, and to identify differences in the methods of selection of appropriate technology. Section 1 describes the variation in livestock production systems in India in general and in Gujarat-state. Livestock comprises defined and undefined breeds of cattle and buffalo. Total livestock population increased annually by over 1 % in the last four decades, with buffalo and goat populations increasing faster than cattle. This section also gives background to the BAIF organization and to FSR methodologies. Section 2 more specifically describes the Gujarat research area with agro-ecological zone-wise information on animal breeds, herd composition, feed resources, crops, and trends in seasonal availability of feed as derived from transects, Participatory Rural Appraisals, and mapping. Constraint analysis and modelling indicated limited genetic potential of the local breeds and shortage of feed resources, both quantitatively and qualitatively, as major constraints for livestock development. Crossbreeding for breed improvement and use of (improved) local feed resources were identified as suitable technologies to alleviate these constraints. Ex-post performance monitoring of some BAIF crossbreeding programmes show that crossbred cattle fitted well in the smallholder mixed farming systems of both tribal and non-tribal farmers in all three selected agro-ecological zones (Section 3). Milk production of crossbreds was substantially higher, as was livestock gross margin and household income. Although quality of the roughages is a major limiting factor, farmers owning crossbreds tried to adjust to the needs of the cows by feeding concentrates. There was no difference in workload and labour division between households with and without crossbreds. Crossbreeding thus proved a techno-economically and socially viable livelihood option for both mixed and landless farming systems in Gujarat. Various modelling approaches were used in Section 4 to explore, ex ante, the suitability of feeding technologies such as urea supplementation, use of local and commercial concentrates, urea-treated straw with concentrates, and leuceana tree leaves for crop-livestock systems in Gujarat, India. Major conclusions were that (i) concentrate feeding is beneficial to farmers with market access and crossbred cows, (ii) crossbreeding interventions are more remunerative for landless and tribal farmers than for non-tribal farmers; feeding interventions are more effective for crossbreds than for local cows, (iii) maximum farm income is achieved at medium milk yields per animal; higher milk yields require use of better feeds, which renders the straws of the grains useless for feeding; at farm level, the (economically) optimum cropping pattern would then shift from grain crops to cotton. This section continues with a narrative on BAIF's experiences with field testing of technologies at animal, at herd, at farm and watershed level, including a shift to crop research when dictated by local needs. Over a period of roughly 30 years, three phases in on-field testing can be distinguished, i. e., starting with a period of predominantly top-down approaches, moving to a phase with emphasis on participatory identification and testing of technologies, and then into a phase with work at community and watershed level. A few cases are discussed for each phase, illustrating the processes, methods and types of technologies involved, and drawing lessons on field experimentation for livestock and rural development in general. The studies brought out, among others, that adoption of technologies is facilitated when these u se local (feed) resources, that are readily available, requires only small changes in farm practices, are relatively simple to implement, and yield tangible results in the short term. Section 5 analyses the dynamics in methods and approaches of BAIF's work on livestock development, as it grew from Gandhian roots into a large development organization. It emphasises the dynamics in approaches between top-down, objectivist and reductionist approaches on one hand and bottom-up, constructivist, holistic and self-organized approaches on the other hand. These experiences are set against similar developments on the (inter) national scene and in industrialized countries, along with factors that influence the changes, suggesting that agricultural R&D behaves as a complex adaptive system with its own dynamics and associated paradigm shifts. It also discusses a number of cross-cutting issues such as the notion of real versus perceived problems, hierarchy and grid, phases in development and aspects of holism versus reductionism, also reflected in notions of goal and process orientation. Concluding, the thesis considers development as a continuous process, of which the goals change over time-and-space. This reflects a paradigm issue, and if development is indeed a dynamic process it implies that choice of methodology and technology) should go along with changes occurring in that process. Some guidelines regarding the usefulness of approaches and technologies are given. But agricultural R&D is ultimately considered to be a complex adaptive system, also in Gujarat, and development organizations such as BAIF have to, therefore, show dynamic behaviour...|$|R
