40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the implementation of}} the system for retrieving candidates for the translation of collocations (combinations of words) from the web. For non-native speakers like Japanese, writing in English is a hard work in order not to use unnatural collocations. Sometimes they have to consult dictionaries or real documents to judge naturalness of English collocations. Besides, it is also difficult to seek out the proper candidates even using dictionaries or real documents. The proposed system is effective to seek out the proper translation of such a collocation. When a user inputs a Japanese collocation 2 ̆ 2 n^J WO v^J 2 ̆ 2 and gathers some nouns each of which co-occurs strongly with v^J <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>meaning</b> as v^J in 2 ̆ 2 n^J WO v^J”, the system retrieves candidates for the translation of v^J from the web with their priorities. After that, the user checks validity of each candidate using the real document which the system provides and includes the English phrase consisting of a predicate verb V^E and its object n^E. Here, n^E is the translation of n^J and V^E is the candidates for the translation of v^J...|$|E

In the EU accession process of these countries, strengthening the rule of law is considered to be of vital importance. Although the concept {{of the rule of law}} is much broader, when it comes to the rule of law requirement, judiciary reform represents the most significant component for reform in the EU accession of Western Balkan countries. Judiciary reform is so crucial to the rule of law reform that it is at times interchangeably used <b>as</b> having <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>meaning.</b> This is not a result of the lack of knowledge and ability to make the distinction between the two, but due to the practical importance that the judiciary plays in the rule of law.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that 'all-risk' {{policies}} do not actually cover all perils. The liability of the insurer in such cases is consequently not absolute. Certain 'self-evident' exclusions, in fact, exist {{in the case of the}} liability of the insurer in an 'all risk' policy. Despite the fact that the insured procured an 'all-risk' policy, an insurer would not be liable to compensate the insured for damages resulting from all occurrences. It is crucial that the precise content and meaning of terms and especially 'wear and tear', 'leakage', 'breakage', 'inherent vice', 'latent defect' and 'defective packaging' be clear. It appears that the South African law of insurance blindly follows the English law. As a result, the potentially problematic interpretation incidental to English law is incorporated into South African insurance law. An example of this problem situation is the current interpretation of 'inherent vice' and 'defective packaging'. In English law, these terms are interpreted <b>as</b> being <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> It is submitted, however, that the defective packaging of a product should not be construed as an inherent vice of that product. The implication of this submission is not that an insurer should be held liable, but that the combination of these concepts <b>as</b> having <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>meaning</b> is not technically correct in law. In similar vein, the South African courts also follow the English courts in their superfluous distinction between 'normal' and 'abnormal' wear and tear, as well as 'normal' and 'abnormal' leakag...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{ethnocide}} was created at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> concept of genocide in 1944 in the United States by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-born lawyer. Ethnocide {{is a term}} that is an alternative to genocide according to Lemkin (Lemkin, 1944). The terms were created precisely {{in regard to the}} persecution of the Jews by the Nazis in the Second World War. In the footnote, to Lemkins definition of genocide (see entry on Genocide), he wrote that another term for genocide is ethnocide. Ethnocide is a combination of the Greek word ethnos meaning nation and the Latin word cide which means to kill. Therefore it can be noted that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> creator of the term ethnocide, Raphael Lemkin did not distinguish between genocide and ethnocide (Semelin, 2005 : 373). The English term, ethnic group, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> French word ethnie, refer to a categorized population with a common language, sometimes common culture and belief in a common geographical origin (Mair 1975 : 4). In essence it can be perceived that ethnocide refers to the destruction of a people and a peoples culture. Ethnocide is not only seen <b>as</b> synonymous with <b>the</b> term genocide, but for some it is also used interchangeably with the term cultural genocide.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of meaning-preserving corrections given {{by an adult}} to a child involves several aspects: (1) the child produces an incorrect utterance, which the adult nevertheless understands, (2) the adult produces a correct utterance with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>meaning</b> and (3) <b>the</b> child recognizes <b>the</b> adult utterance <b>as</b> having <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>as</b> its previous utterance, and takes that as a signal that its previous utterance is not correct according to the adult grammar. An adequate model of this phenomenon must incorporate utterances and meanings, account for how the child and adult can understand each other’s meanings, and model how meaning-preserving corrections interact with the child’s increasing mastery of language production. In this paper we are concerned with how a learner who has learned to comprehend utterances might go about learning to produce them. We consider a model of language comprehension and production based on finite sequential and subsequential transducers. Utterances are modeled as finite sequences of words and meanings as finite sequences of predicates. Comprehension is interpreted as a mapping of utterances to meanings and production as a mapping of meanings to utterances. Previous work (Castellanos et al., 1993; Pieraccini et al., 1993) has applied subsequential transducers and the OSTIA algorithm {{to the problem of}} learning to comprehend language; here we apply them to the problem of learning to produce language. For ten natural languages and a limited domain of geometric shapes and their properties and relations we define sequential transducers to produce pairs consisting of an utterance in that language and its meaning. Using this data we empirically explore the properties of the OSTIA and DD-OSTIA algorithms for the tasks of learning comprehension and production in this domain, to assess whether they may provide a basis for a model of meaning-preserving corrections. ...|$|R

40|$|Interpreting is {{regarded}} as a useful communication device when two persons (A and B) who do not speak each other’s language, want to exchange information through spoken language. The technique involves the help of a third person, a go-between or interpreter, who speaks and understands both languages. Speaker A produces a stretch of speech, which the interpreter then summarizes and translates into language B. Speaker B’s response is then translated by the interpreter into language A, and so on. Interpreting can take place in parallel with the input speech in either language A or B (simultaneous interpreting) or consecutively, i. e. in between turns taken by speakers A and B. In either case, the interpreter’s task is highly demanding; it takes years of intensive training to become a skilled interpreter. Interpreting studies have been set up to provide a model of the interpreting mechanism, which in turn may be used to set up and improve training programs for student interpreters. When interpreting, the interpreter has to keep (a semantic representation of) the input speech in memory, while formulating <b>the</b> equivalent <b>as</b> a suitable output in the source language. Working memory, therefore, is an essential resource in the interpreting process but it has long been ignored by interpreting programs. Our paper presents a theoretical overview of the concept of working memory and how it may contribute to the quality of (simultaneous or consecutive) interpreting. There are some special methods to train memory which are generally accepted. However, few curriculum developers talk about memory training for interpreter trainees in academic institutions. Specific functions of working memory in the interpreting process are to (i) retain source language, (ii) compute the meaning (i. e. to understand) of the source language and (iii) encode (as well <b>as</b> possible) <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>meaning</b> in <b>the</b> target language. We will review and discuss methods to train memory for interpreter trainees specifically targeting the three aspects identified above. Our conclusion is that memory (sub) skills in interpreting could be acquired by interpreter trainees through effectively designed exercises. With a well-trained working memory, interpreters can actually be equipped with an effective tool for the encoding and decoding of information. It is suggested, therefore, that academic settings for future interpreter training include memory training in their curriculum...|$|R
