5|$|Depopulation {{stemming}} from the Black Death led to increased wages, static food costs and a resulting improvement in {{the standard of living}} for the peasantry. However, under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> state known as the Great Slump. The economy was in ruins by 1450, a consequence of the loss of France, piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the Hanseatic League. The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, which drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years {{at the end of the}} 1440s, collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of the South-West. The Crown's debts reached £372,000, Henry's deficit was £20,000 per annum, and tax revenues were half those of his father.|$|E
5|$|After {{eliminating}} an Austrian army {{during the}} Ulm Campaign, French forces seized Vienna in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until {{the arrival of}} the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.|$|E
25|$|Shaun King {{was finally}} benched having thrown <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> 9-for-26, an interception, and only 73 yards passing. Rob Johnson {{took over in}} the second half, and {{salvaged}} {{the remainder of the}} game. With 1:23 to go, Keyshawn Johnson caught a touchdown pass, and avoided the shutout.|$|E

25|$|Cosimo III's reign was characterised by {{drastic changes}} {{and a sharp}} decline of the Grand Duchy. Cosimo III was of a puritan character, banning May celebrations, forcing prostitutes to pay for {{licenses}} and, beheading sodomites. He also instituted several laws censoring education and introduced anti-Jewish legislation. He imposed crippling taxes while the country's population continued to decline. By 1705, the grand ducal treasury was virtually bankrupt, and the population of Florence had declined by approximately 50%, while {{the population of the}} entire grand duchy had decreased by an estimated 40%. The once powerful navy was reduced to <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> state.|$|E
25|$|Of course, we may {{expect to}} hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 Owen Wyn Owen {{decided to}} {{excavate}} and restore Babs. The {{site of the}} burial was identified from old photographs, but it {{was found to be}} within the perimeter of the present-day rocket establishment. The military authorities granted permission for the excavation on condition that Parry-Thomas's next of kin did not object. It took Wyn Owen two years to locate a living relative, a nephew living in Walsall, and finally the wreck was recovered. This recovery was controversial at the time, less so after the successful restoration. The prevailing opinion was that the wreck would be unsalveagable for anything more than <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> museum display. Few expected that the wreck would ever resemble a car again, let alone be restored to running order.|$|E

25|$|Although the UMAP program {{ended in}} 1968, the camps {{themselves}} continued. They became military units, {{and the same}} types of men were sent there as were sent to the UMAP camps. The only difference was that the men were paid <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> salary for their long and harsh working hours while living under very difficult and inhumane conditions. A 1984 documentary, Improper Conduct, interviewed several men who had been sent to these camps. In his autobiography, My Life, Fidel Castro claims the internment camps were used in lieu of the mistreatment homosexuals were receiving in the military during the Cuban intervention in Angola and other conflicts. They would do laborious tasks and be housed roughly, but some saw it as better than joining the Cuban military because there, they would often be publicly humiliated and discharged by homophobic elements.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 he was {{discharged}} from his duties at Walter Reed Hospital having reached {{the rank of}} captain. He returned to Long Hill, and with his money dwindling {{made the decision to}} return to the ring. After six months of preparation he faced 'Kid' Green on 28 December 1920. Despite the three and a half-year absence from the ring, Welsh was in good shape and took only four rounds to beat Green; though he had switched his trademark defensive boxing to a heavier brawling style. Welsh then fought twice in May 1921, against Willie Jackson and Kid Murphy, both wins; but the most notable event regarding the bouts was the appearance of heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who was spending time relaxing at Welsh's health farm. After two more fights in 1921, both in Canada, Welsh returned to New York to face Archie Walker in April 1922. The fight was a sporting disaster for Welsh, losing seven of the ten rounds, and by the tenth he was being chased around the ring as he covered himself up. It was <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> display and Welsh never stepped into a professional ring again.|$|E

The ramshackle condition of the capital was noted by philosopher Montesquieu five years into Gian Gastone's reign: [...] "There is no town where men live in less luxury than Florence". Despite these hindrances, Gian Gastone, aged 52, commenced his reign with a burst of ebullience, releasing prisoners, abolishing exorbitant taxes, [...] "Pensions on the Creed" [...] (monies paid to converts to Christianity) and public executions.|$|E

In October 1892, he moved into a rooming house in Manhattan whose boarders were a group of medical students. During this time, he expanded or entirely reworked Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, which is about a girl who [...] "blossoms in a mud-puddle" [...] and becomes <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> victim of circumstance. [...] In the winter of 1893, Crane took the manuscript of Maggie to Richard Watson Gilder, who rejected it for publication in The Century Magazine.|$|E

Eric Goldman of IGN, giving the episode an 8.2. rating ("Impressive"), wrote favorably, {{noting that the}} depiction Dr. Octopus [...] "was very clever – on one hand, he was <b>a</b> <b>pitiful,</b> cowering pushover. But when Norman was berating him we got a brief look at the anger within, as he imagined attacking Norman with his robotic tentacles." [...] Goldman applauded both Dr. Octopus' line, [...] "I've been good" [...] and when Spider-Man crashes into several stuffed animals, only to be pulled out by Dr. Octopus {{in a manner similar}} to a carnival game; he concluded that, [...] "This show continues to leave several prime time live-action shows to shame when it comes to building serialized stories and has been one of the most pleasant surprises of the TV season." ...|$|E

[...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable."

500|$|Pierre Pentecôte, {{the militia}} {{character}} played by Carlo Brandt, {{was presented with}} <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> look, rather than a caricature villain. [...] Gatlif depicted him as a character with a drooping hat and a few extra pounds to symbolise the fat militia of the period. The orphan, P'tite Claude, was played by Mathias Laliberté. Rufus was chosen by Gatlif {{for the role of}} Fernand because of his typical French looks. Puri Dai, the grandmother, was played by Raya Bielenberg, a Soviet-born Norwegian artist and 2005 recipient of Oslo City art award, who uses music and dance {{in an effort to make}} the Romani culture better known in Norway. Gatlif found her in Oslo. The other notable characters in the movie, Darko, Kako, Chavo, Zanko and Tatane were played by Arben Bajraktaraj, Georges Babluani, Ilijir Selimoski, Kevyn Diana and Thomas Baumgartner respectively. A minor character named Levis was played by then 11-year-old great-grandson of Django Reinhardt, a virtuoso jazz guitarist and composer of Manouche Romani ethnicity. The cast included people of many nationalities, Albanian, Kosovar, Georgian, Serbian, French and Norwegian along with the nine Romani people Gatlif found living in extreme poverty in Transylvania. Arrangements were made for these Romani to stay in France for the three to four months it took to shoot the film.|$|E
500|$|Following the Ulm Campaign, French forces {{managed to}} capture Vienna in November. The fall of Vienna {{provided}} the French a huge bounty as they captured [...] muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the Danube. At this critical juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations {{from some of}} their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north {{in pursuit of the}} Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz. At the Battle of Austerlitz, in Moravia on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process. The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan — of the same stature as Cannae, the celebrated triumph by Hannibal some 2,000 years before.|$|E
500|$|Newspaper {{reaction}} to the result was generally along partisan lines. [...] The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, a Republican paper, stated of Hanna, [...] "And {{this is the man}} against whom has been waged a war than which political history furnishes none more venomous, vicious, and relentlessly vituperative. It is a disgraceful story, known of all men." [...] The Blade, another Republican paper, agreed, writing, [...] "The fight against Mr. Hanna was the most malignantly traitorous contest ever waged in the political annals of Ohio." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Silver Democratic paper, argued, [...] "The Republican contingent which stuck to the last against Hanna has made a record which the victorious faction might well envy... Their fight was... against the chairman of the national committee and all its forces and resources; against the president of the United States, with his tremendous party influence and more influential patronage. Against all this they have cut down the man who a year ago was, next to the president, the leading Republican of the United States, to <b>a</b> <b>pitiful</b> majority of one in his ambition to be elected to the Senate, and that obtained under circumstances not creditable to him. They chased him so hard that he dare not stop to have the gravest charges investigated." [...] Hearst's New York Journal noted, [...] "And so it is to be 'Senator Hanna' for seven years. Well, the senatorship can add nothing to its holder's power for evil. As long as Hanna has his money he can control senatorships, whether he occupies them or not. Perhaps it is best to have him in the open." ...|$|E
