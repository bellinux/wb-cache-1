5|$|By {{length of}} story, Planetarian is the {{shortest}} of Key's games. Excluding the opening and ending sequences, there are 16 parts to the story; the first half is set within the planetarium while the latter half is set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides. The novel takes four hours and forty minutes to complete on auto play. After the game has been completed at least once, two new options appear on the title screen. The first is <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> allows the player to view twenty images of CG artwork observed in the game.

The headhouse has <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> is unusual {{to the subway}} system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E

5|$|On 27 April, the {{battalion}} was {{called upon to}} reinforce positions held by the Australian 2nd Battalion along <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> would later be known as Walker's Ridge. A Turkish counterattack had been launched, threatening the flank of the ANZAC position. By nightfall, Malone had established a new defensive line along the ridge although he was frustrated by the poor decisions by the commander of 2nd Battalion, Colonel George Braund. Malone believed Braund's actions had wasted {{the lives of his}} men. He consequently made a request to the acting commander of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, Brigadier General Harold Walker that the Wellington Battalion take sole charge of the position, a request which was approved. In the following days, Malone worked his men hard to improve the defensive positions and ensure the stability of the Walker's Ridge positions.|$|E

5|$|Suillus luteus fruit {{bodies are}} {{sometimes}} infested with larvae, though {{not nearly as}} often as S.granulatus or B.edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare {{late in the season}} with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70â95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.|$|E

A third batch was ordered in 1931, coinciding with a downturn in the volume of freight due to the economic depression. This meant that {{the last of the}} S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this batch. A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped with smoke deflectors to improve visibility from the footplate when travelling at speed. This modification was <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete â living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared {{sometime in the}} late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it {{is found in the}} eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys, both dated to 125 million years ago. Epipubic bones, <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and mammaliformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental mammaliformes, though Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium appear to have lacked them.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35â1250 by 200â450Î¼m. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18â30Î¼m thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5â4Î¼m in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1Î¼m in diameter.

5|$|Unlike the amphipods, {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} isopods are entirely benthic. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and {{may explain why}} so many species are endemic to restricted ranges. Crawling is the primary means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the Flabellifera can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial sea slaters (Ligia spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened, <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> has evolved independently in different groups {{and also in the}} marine sphaeromatids.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent. He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E
