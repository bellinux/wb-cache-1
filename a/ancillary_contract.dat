40|$|A {{rudimentary}} {{conceptualization of}} the development of <b>ancillary</b> <b>contract</b> terms would assert competition will result in terms that are joint-wealth-maximizing for merchants and customers. Building on developments in modeling frictions in markets, this article presents simple models of frictions in multi-period contracting as to <b>ancillary</b> <b>contract</b> terms. The modeling illustrates that, for plausible parameter estimates of frictions, combinations of switching costs and investigation costs may allow collectively inferior contract terms to persist in consumer transactions. The results are in harmony with recent evidence illustrating the infrequency with which consumers actually read contract terms. The modeling identifies circumstances where this opportunistic behavior [...] taking advantage of frictions to secure collectively suboptimal contract terms [...] is particularly likely. They include: (i) contracts of small dollar amounts, in terms of consideration or marginal cost in rendering performance; (ii) contracting involving the sequencing of relationship-specific investments during formation; (iii) multi-period contracting involving increasing switching costs; (iv) rapidly growing markets; and (v) merchants who bifurcate contractual terms among customers. A number of these factors are common to the provision of online services. This article additionally samples authority that can be revived by courts inclined to police opportunistic structuring of the methods of mutual assent to secure collectively suboptimal contract terms...|$|E

If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Under Chapter 7, section 9. 3. 1, the IESO is obligated to limit the term of <b>contracted</b> <b>ancillary</b> services <b>contracts</b> to not more than 18 months. Chapter 7, section 9. 7. 1 requires the duration of reliability mustrun (RMR) contracts to be limited to not more than 1 year. <b>Contracted</b> <b>Ancillary</b> Services Contracts: <b>Contracted</b> <b>ancillary</b> services include regulation (automatic generation control or AGC), black start capability, voltage control and reactive support, and emergency demand response load. A market participant wishing to be a new provider of <b>contracted</b> <b>ancillary</b> services may need to incur significant costly equipment upgrades. Market participants have indicated that the cost of these upgrades must be amortized over the period of the contract, as there is no guarantee of revenue beyond the 18 month term of the contract. Amortizing a capital expenditure over this relatively short time frame increases the up-front costs to the market, with lower prices not expected until subsequent contracts. In addition, if equipment upgrades are necessary, prospective service providers may choos...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the current Australian courts’ definitions of employee and independent contractor. It highlights where the franchisee fits, being indistinguishable at times from an employee {{and at other}} times from an independent contractor. The paper examines the policy behind insolvency legislation in Australia and queries whether it would be appropriate to accord franchisees specific status in the franchisor’s insolvency; like that enjoyed by employees. In most situations, the definition is relatively unimportant. The Franchise Agreement, <b>ancillary</b> <b>contracts</b> and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) regulate the franchisor/ franchisee relationship. If the franchisor becomes insolvent, the failure of the law {{to keep pace with the}} franchise business model is bought into sharp focus. Whereas the employee and the independent contractor have clearly understood rights, enshrined in statute, the franchisee has no specific rights. Unless the franchisee is a creditor of the franchisor, it does not have a right to attend creditors meetings. At its most vulnerable, the franchisee is categorized as an asset or a liability in the insolvent estate. The franchisor – franchisee relationship, however, has many features that make the franchisee more vulnerable than an employer whose employer becomes insolvent. If the franchisor becomes insolvent, the franchisee may loose the value of sunk investments, the right to occupy premises, and may not be able to free itself from onerous contracts that were only entered into because of its position as a franchisee...|$|R

40|$|The {{endeavor}} for a {{more sustainable}} power generation {{has led to a}} dramatic increase in power generation from renewable energy sources (RES), such as wind and solar. These sources are of fluctuating nature and therefore introduce new challenges to power system operation, which was historically designed for generators with constant infeed. The fluctuations are balanced by <b>ancillary</b> services <b>contracted</b> from flexible generators or storages. So far, large scale solutions for storage are only provided by pumped hydro. However, one potential solution for a large storage could be to aggregate Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), once they are adopted on a wide scale, into a virtual storage. This storage could then be used to balance the infeed error of RES. The balancing would imply that the PHEVs could be recharged from emission free sources, thereby enabling an emission free individual transportation sector. This paper focuses on the realization of an aggregated PHEV storage and the balancing of RES infeed errors. In specific, the paper investigates how a large fleet of PHEVs can be aggregated over a large, urban electricity distribution network and how this storage can be used to balance a wind infeed error while considering the limits of the underlying infrastructure. The balancing can be achieved through so called vehicle-to-gri...|$|R
40|$|The Transmission System Operator (TSO) is {{responsible}} for a stable and secure exploitation of the electricity grid in its control zone. This is mainly achieved by contracting power generators delivering ancillary services {{in addition to their}} main commercial product, active power. Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources (RES-e) is today generally exempted from the participation in ancillary services. However, the increasing share integration of variable RES-e with a limited predictability has an impact on the demand and supply structure of these services. In this paper, the possibility of wind power participating in frequency control or delivering active power reserves as an ancillary service is investigated. Within this framework, technical, regulatory and economic aspects are examined and evaluated. As the specific details about the way <b>ancillary</b> services are <b>contracted</b> differ over Europe, a case-study is done for the Belgian control zone. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Researchers have {{proposed}} that plug-in hybrid elec-tric vehicles (PHEVs) performing vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) ancillary services can accrue significant economic benefits without de-grading vehicle performance. However, analyses to date have not evaluated the effect that automatic generator control signal energy content and call rate has on V 2 G ancillary service reliability and value. This research incorporates {{a new level of}} detail into the modeling of V 2 G ancillary services by incorporating probabilistic vehicle travel models, time-series automatic generation control signals, and time series ancillary services pricing into a non-linear dynamic simulation of the driving and charging behavior of PHEVs. Stochastic results are generated using Monte-Carlo methods. Results show that in order to integrate a V 2 G system into the existing market and power grid the V 2 G system will require: 1) an aggregative architecture to meet current industry standard reliability requirements; 2) the construction of low energy automatic generation control signals; 3) a lower percent call for V 2 G even if the pool of <b>contracted</b> <b>ancillary</b> service resources gets smaller; 4) a consideration of vehicle performance degradation due to the potential loss of electrically driven miles; and 5) a high-power home charging capability. Index Terms—Automatic generation control, frequency regu-lation, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, reliability, vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G). I...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays which examine the industrial organization of retail gasoline markets. In particular, each essay studies issues involving product differentiation. Each essay employs a data set which includes detailed information on every gasoline station in the five-county Los Angeles Basin. These data include information on wholesale and retail prices, volumes sold, station characteristics, and station location. ^ Essay One constructs a model which combines both vertical and horizontal product differentiation to explain observed price-cost margin differentials between unleaded grades of gasoline. The model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions are supported using the station-level data from the Los Angeles market. In particular, {{the results indicate that}} margins and margin differentials are a function of the proximity of rival stations and the distribution of consumers 2 ̆ 7 marginal value for quality, among other things. ^ Essay Two utilizes the voluminous theory of spatial location and differentiation to construct an empirical model which estimates the relationship between spatial differentiation and the number of competing stations in a market, controlling for demand and cost considerations, as well as non-spatial station attributes and firm distribution-chain effects. The results indicate that gasoline stations, ceteris paribus, prefer to spatially differentiate themselves from competing stations as the number of competing stations in the market increases. ^ Essay Three considers a model of product differentiation characterized by stations extracting rents from consumers based on consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to pay for quality in the form of full-service gasoline. In particular, the model predicts that stations offering both self- and full-service gasoline can set prices such that consumers self-select into the appropriate quality category. The results of the empirical model indicate that stations offering both service types (1) charge higher full-service prices than stations offering only full-service gasoline, and (2) charge lower self-service prices than stations offering only self-service gasoline. ^ Finally, Essay Four extends the third essay by examining the determinants of service mix for gasoline stations in the Los Angeles market. Empirical results indicate that the likelihood of observing full-service at a gasoline station is a function of market determinants, complementarity of <b>ancillary</b> profit centers, <b>contract</b> type, and the level of congestion in the self-service queue. ...|$|R
