500|$|James {{was widely}} mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely {{retained}} the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. [...] "As {{he lived in}} peace," [...] remarked the Earl of Kellie, [...] "so did he die in peace, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> God our king [...] may follow him". The earl prayed in vain: once in power, Charles and Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure. James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; and his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth.|$|E

In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Charlotte wrote: [...] "My dear husband, too, appears in a new light in his own country. More than once I have had deep {{pleasure}} in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; for that I have got one of the best gentlemen in the country .... I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man." ...|$|E

In February 1976, Kerik completed his {{tour of duty in}} South Korea and left mother and daughter behind. In his autobiography, Kerik called the episode [...] "a mistake I will always regret, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> to God that one day I can make it right." ...|$|E

He also said, [...] "The resort to extremism and violence is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated anywhere at any time. The perpetrators must be brought to justice." [...] He added, [...] "I hope the people in Pakistan will remain calm <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> that the situation in Pakistan will soon stabilise." ...|$|E

60|$|So I lay, {{with that}} yellow light on me; and {{strength}} came strangely to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>prayed</b> that, since die I must, I might at least gladden him {{with no sign}} of fear. When he found that he could not daunton me, he laughed again.|$|R

"All right, sir," [...] said Giles, [...] "I'll go, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>prays</b> you'll {{find some}} one what {{will keep your}} hares which you must have, and your {{pheasants}} which you must have, and your partridges which you must have, without killing these varmints of foxes what eats the lot." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rape is an evil act. I {{used the}} wrong {{words in the}} wrong way and for that I apologize. As {{the father of two}} daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a {{compassionate}} heart for the victims of sexual assault, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims. The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness. In relation to the resulting furor over his original [...] "legitimate rape" [...] comment, Akin said: [...] "I talk about one word, one sentence, one day out of place, and, all of a sudden, the entire establishment turns on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gray {{asked that}} no {{member of his}} family witness the execution, which he {{described}} as [...] "murder," [...] although a female cousin and a minister were present. The only witness for the victims present at the execution was Kevin Cummins, the uncle of the two girls. Gray also made no last meal request and gave no instructions for the disposal of his body. His final statement: [...] "I go forward now on wings built by the love and support of my family and friends. I go with {{a peace of mind}} that comes from never having taken a human life. I forgive those who have hardened their hearts to the truth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> they ask forgiveness, for they know not what they do. This is not a death, it is a lynching." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> {{laughed as}} I drove from the station, but the mirth died {{out on my}} lips As I thought of the fools like Pagett who write of their [...] "Eastern trips," [...] And the sneers of the {{traveled}} idiots who duly misgovern the land, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>prayed</b> to the Lord to deliver another one into my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{will come}} back," [...] {{was all he}} said. But I saw that the doubt, if doubt it were, had gone. I watched him as he went away, that tall, gentle, kindly-eyed man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>prayed</b> that his trust might not be misplaced; for if it should be it would break his heart.|$|R

I think that they have paid the price for this act. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>pray</b> for their freedom." [...] The response was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E
