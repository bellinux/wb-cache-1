40|$|Abstract The {{approximation}} of the optimal policy functions is investigated for dy-namic optimization problems with an objective that is additive over {{a finite number}} of stages. The distance between optimal and suboptimal values of the objective func-tional is estimated, in terms of the errors in approximating the optimal policy func-tions at the various stages. Smoothness properties are derived for such functions and exploited to choose the approximating families. The approximation error is measured in the supremum norm, in such a way to control the error propagation from stage to stage. Nonlinear approximators corresponding to Gaussian radial-basis-function net-works with <b>adjustable</b> <b>centers</b> and widths are considered. Conditions are defined, guaranteeing that the number of Gaussians (hence, the number of parameters to be adjusted) does not grow “too fast ” with the dimension of the state vector. The results help to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in dynamic optimization. An example of application is given {{and the use of the}} estimates is illustrated via a numerical simula-tion...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{two problems}} that are frequently encountered when modeling data by linear combinations of nonlinear parameterized functions. The first problem is feature selection, when features are sought as functions that are nonlinear in their parameters (e. g. Gaussians with <b>adjustable</b> <b>centers</b> and widths, wavelets with adjustable translations and dilations, etc.). The second problem is the design of an intelligible representation for 1 D- and 2 D- signals with peaks and troughs that have a definite meaning for experts. To address the first problem, a generalization of the Orthogonal Forward Regression method is described. To address the second problem, a new family of nonlinear parameterized functions, termed Gaussian mesa functions, is defined. It allows the modeling of signals such that each significant peak or trough is modeled by a single, identifiable function. The resulting representation is sparse in terms of adjustable parameters, thereby lending itself easily to automatic analysis and classification, yet it is readily intelligible for the expert. An application of the methodology to the automatic analysis of electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings is described. Applications {{to the analysis of}} neurophysiological signals and EEG signals (early detection of Alzheimer’s disease) are outlined...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network to be used in predicting the effectiveness of various strategies for reducing the Vehicle Trip Rate (VTR) of a worksite. Three methods of learning were utilized in training the Gaussian hidden units of the network, those being a) output weight adjustment using the Delta rule b) adjustable reference vectors in conjunction with weight adjustment, and c) a combination of <b>adjustable</b> <b>centers</b> and adjustable sigma values for each RBF neuron with the Delta rule. The justification for utilizing each of the more advanced levels of training is provided using a series of tests and performance comparisons. The network architecture is then selected based upon a series of initial trials for an optimum number of hidden Radial Basis neurons. In a similar manner, the training time is determined after finding a maximum number of epochs during which there is a significant change in the SSE. The network was compared for effectiveness against each of the following methods of data analysis: force-entered regression, backward regression, forward regression, stepwise regression, and two types of back-propagation networks based upon the attributes discovered to be most predictive by these regression techniques. A comparison of the learning methods used on the Radial Basis network shows the third learning strategy to be the most efficient for training, yielding the lowest sum of squared errors (SSE) in the shortest number of training epochs. The result of comparing the RBF implementation against the other methods mentions shows the superiority of the Radial Basis method for predictive ability...|$|E

40|$|For {{shoulders}} with rotator cuff damage, the reverse shoulder replacement medializes {{the center of}} glenohumeral joint rotation, lending larger moment arms to undamaged muscles like the deltoid. The aim of this thesis was to create and use a computational model of the glenohumeral joint with an <b>adjustable</b> joint <b>center</b> to investigate and quantify the role of its position on middle deltoid moment arms for coronal plane abduction. The model confirmed that muscle moment arms increase {{as the center of}} rotation is shifted medially or inferiorly from the anatomical position. Specifically, medial translation of the glenohumeral center increased moment arms at low abduction angles while inferior shifts increased moment arms at high angles. Excursions of the middle deltoid were found to increase linearly as the joint center was moved medially or inferiorly: 1 mm medial translation or 1. 33 mm inferior translation caused about 1 mm of increase in muscle excursion.

What kind of robotic end-effector should be built for such tasks? The human hand has evolved to be a general purpose manipulator that adapts to the richness of our daily lives but, in doing so, it is not particularly suited to manufacturing operations. Here, special tools, fixtures, and protective layers are heavily relied on. This paper describes the initial development of a hand specifically for manufacturing work. This has involved the manufacture of an instrumented wrist with an <b>adjustable</b> remote <b>center</b> of compliance, and the design of fingers for gripping. Object shapes have also been analyzed in order to provide for a stable static grip. Importantly, these studies of the physical aspects of prehension have been matched to tasks. The research has considered a range of industrial operations and specified the level of end-effector control needed.

30|$|MPc {{has been}} widely studied as an {{excellent}} sensing material due to the following virtues [17, 18].

Its <b>center</b> metal, peripheral, and axial substituent group can be changed, which provides possibilities for us to design the target hybrids according to our ideas. More importantly, the peripheral active ground of MPc and the in-plane system with a large π-conjugated structure provide a profitable tendency to combine the large basal plane of carbon materials through noncovalent or covalent modification and improve the target hybrids’ gas-sensing properties.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Combining {{both kinds}} of fuzzy logic forms {{including}} fuzzy T-S model and adaptive fuzzy logic systems, this paper presents an adaptive control scheme for a class of nonlinear systems. Firstly, the fuzzy T-S model is used to approximate the nonlinear systems, and the fuzzy control law of the fuzzy model is derived by the linear matrix inequality. Secondly, the adaptive fuzzy logic systems are constructed, and the modeling errors are eliminated by a compensator based on the adaptive fuzzy logic systems with three <b>adjustable</b> parameters: weights, <b>centers</b> and widths. It is proved that the closed loop system satisfies the anticipant performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the control scheme is effective.

40|$|The Optical Plume Anomaly Detection Program, an {{experimental}} {{study in the}} attempt to create a rocket engine health monitor based on detection and possible quantification of anomalous atomic and molecular species in the exhaust plume, has been in existence for several years. The instruments developed to monitor the exhaust plumes are presented. Two optical instruments are employed: the polychromator and the spectrometer. The polychromator is a 16 channel spectroradiometer having independent channels individually <b>adjustable</b> for <b>center</b> wavelength and pass bandwidth. Those values may be mechanically reset, with the aid of certain lab equipment. The spectrometer is a multichannel spectral analyzer having two 2048 element linear photodiode arrays at the exit plane of the dispersing instrument, which, like the 16 channel device, is a 1 / 2 meter grating spectrograph. These instruments are equipped with ultraviolet grade multifiber optical input cables, allowing the instruments to be placed in a benign environment. Telescopes mounted on the test stand observe the plume keeping the shock structure in view. The data acquisition and control system consist of four 80386 - 33 MHz computers: two at the test stand for instrument control and data preconditioning, and two in the test support building providing data archiving, display, and system control.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} experimentally {{the feasibility}} of a polymer waveguide notch filter using a thermooptic long-period grating. This notch filter consists of a channel waveguide, a cladding surrounding the channel, and buffer layers sandwiching the cladding. Periodic heaters formed on the upper buffer layer induce a long-period grating thermooptically. Thus, they generate temporarily a resonance band of notch type in the transmission spectrum of the filter. Using thermocurable polymers, we have fabricated notch filters 1 and 2 that have different cladding thicknesses. Experimental results demonstrate two features of the notch filters. One feature is dynamical controllability of the attenuation of a resonance band. For TE mode, the maximum attenuation of notch filters 1 and 2 increases from 0 to 27 dB as the power applied to notch filters 1 and 2 increases from 0 to 851 and 1170 mW, respectively. The other feature is controllability of the direction and magnitude of the center wavelength shift occurring when the attenuation is tuned. The shift property depends on the cladding thickness. The measured characteristics of notch filters 1 and 2 are qualitatively in good agreement with our theoretical analysis. Using this feature, we may implement the notch filter whose attenuation is. <b>adjustable</b> without <b>center</b> wavelength shift. This polymer waveguide notch filter {{may be used to}} implement a compact filter whose spectrum is dynamically tailored. close 171...|$|R
40|$|With VESALIUS, K. U. Leuven {{introduces}} a generic platform for developing robotic assistive technology for MIS. In earlier work, clinical tests {{were carried out}} with a five degrees of freedom laparoscopic laser robot, commanded through an intuitive user interface. Automatic autofocus and instrument insertion technology based on 3 D laparoscope image processing was shown to be extremely useful. The goal of this first VESALIUS robot was to provide accuracy, dexterity, stability and safety in laparoscopic CO 2 laser ablation. Current efforts are directed to transfer this expertise to new systems and novel surgical applications. Based upon its patent-pending <b>Adjustable</b> Remote <b>Center</b> of Motion (ARCM) mechanism and its modular design, the system was transformed to a novel robotic laparoscope holder. In MIS, instrument or camera (laparoscope or endoscope) holders can simplify surgical procedures making them less demanding and possibly more effective. The work load of assisting staff is reduced. as the focus can shift towards manipulation of the instrument or camera with the holder providing the needed support. This could result in more stable imaging or extra precise manipulation. The new laparoscope holder, the VESALIUS Passive Holder (VPH), outperforms existing holders in compactness, stability and ease-of-use, showing great potential to assist surgeons that rely on stable images during precision minimal invasive interventions. Additional R&D in MEMS, HMI, image processing, ergonomics, force feedback, biosensors, image sensors, surgical integration etc. is ongoing to shape the VESALIUS platform towards other MIS procedures. status: publishe...|$|R
