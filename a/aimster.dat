Capitol launched an innovative marketing campaign, broadcasting [...] "blips", short films set to Kid A music, on music channels and distributing them online.

Capitol also streamed the album through Amazon, MTV.com and heavy.com, and for three days ran a promotional campaign with the peer-to-peer filesharing service <b>Aimster,</b> allowing users to swap iBlips and Radiohead-branded <b>Aimster</b> skins.|$|E
50|$|In In re <b>Aimster,</b> the Seventh Circuit {{was called}} upon to decide the {{liability}} of peer to peer sharing of music files through the Instant Messaging services provided by <b>Aimster.</b> <b>Aimster</b> had argued that the transmission of files between its users was encrypted and because of that, <b>Aimster</b> could not possibly know the nature of files being transmitted using its services. But, the Seventh circuit Court of Appeals affirmed {{the decision of the}} district court which had issued a preliminary injunction against <b>Aimster.</b> It was found that <b>Aimster</b> had knowledge of the infringing activity. Its tutorial showed examples of copyrighted music files being shared. Also, the ‘Club Aimster’ service provided a list of 40 most popular songs made available on the service. It was also held that the encrypted nature of the transmission was not a valid defence as it was merely a means to avoid liability by purposefully remaining ignorant. It was held that ‘wilful blindness is knowledge, in copyright law..”The Sony defence raised by <b>Aimster</b> was also rejected because of the inability of <b>Aimster</b> to bring on record any evidence to show that its service could be used for non infringing uses. Lastly, <b>Aimster</b> could also not get benefit of DMCA ‘safe harbor’ provisions because it had not done anything to comply with the requirements of Section 512. Instead, it encouraged infringement.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the RIAA sued <b>Aimster,</b> which {{provided}} a similar service.|$|E
50|$|The {{defendants}} argued that, unlike Napster, they designed {{their technology}} {{in such a}} way that they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. Someone who wanted to use <b>Aimster's</b> basic service for the first time to swap files had to download <b>Aimster's</b> software and then had to register on the system. After doing this he might designate any other registered user called a buddy, with whom he might communicate directly whenever both of them were online, and have the capability of interchanging music files. If the user did not designate any buddies, then all the users of the system became automatically his buddies to share files.|$|R
5000|$|The Madster {{service was}} {{initially}} called <b>Aimster,</b> {{but it was}} later renamed to Madster due to concerns that the <b>Aimster</b> name infringed AOL's AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) trademark. The Madster software allowed users to share files via instant messaging services. In particular, users could share files specifically with users who were included on a [...] "buddy list" [...] with the advantage of privacy.|$|E

50|$|Owners of copyrighted {{popular music}} claimed that John Deep ("Deep")'s <b>Aimster</b> Internet service was a {{contributory}} and vicarious infringer of these copyrights. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 252 F.Supp.2d 634, Marvin E. Aspen, Jr., granted preliminary injunction for plaintiffs, which shut down Defendant's service until {{the suit was}} resolved, <b>Aimster</b> appealed from this preliminary injunction to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.|$|E
50|$|The court {{analyzed}} {{that the}} copyrighted materials might sometimes be shared between users {{of such a}} system without the authorization of the holder of the copyright owner and, in this case, fair-use privilege will not make the <b>Aimster</b> a contributory infringer. As mentioned in the Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 104 S. Ct. 774, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1984), {{also known as the}} Betamax case, the producer of a product which has substantial noninfringing uses is not a contributory infringer, merely because some of the uses actually made of the product are infringing. In that case a video reproducer machine called Betamax, the predecessor of today's videocassette recorders was at the issue. The court explained about the sale of the Betamax that the ability of a service provider to prevent its customers from infringing is a factor to be considered in determining whether the provider is or not a contributory infringer. In re <b>Aimster</b> Copyright Litig., 252 F. Supp. 2d 634, <b>Aimster,</b> however, was not able to produce any evidence that its service had ever been used for a noninfringing purpose, instead the facts showed that <b>Aimster</b> encouraged these infringing activities.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2002, {{the company}} was ordered {{by a federal judge}} to {{disconnect}} its computer systems from the Internet. Earlier on in September, the court stated that <b>Aimster</b> had knowledge of copyright infringements, including a Web-based [...] "Aimster Guardian" [...] tutorial that showed copyrighted materials and the tracking of popular songs on the service via [...] "Club Aimster"; the latter also indicated contribution to infringing activity and the monthly fees for the service indicated a financial interest for the <b>Aimster</b> operators in conjunction with infringing usage. The requirement for users to sign up and log in to use the service meant that <b>Aimster</b> {{was in a position to}} control the activities of its users. The injunction to disconnect was upheld in June 2003 by the decision in In re <b>Aimster</b> Copyright Litigation of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In particular, it was found that Madster's support of encrypted file sharing was [...] "willful blindness" [...] and was not a valid defense with regard to copyright infringement. At the same time, a company could avoid copyright liability if it was [...] "highly burdensome" [...] for the company to detect and prevent copyright infringement. In January 2004, the US Supreme Court refused without explanation to hear an appeal of the lower court's ruling.|$|E
50|$|The Court also {{rejected}} Aimster's {{argument that}} because the court said in Betamax that mere constructive knowledge of infringing uses {{is not enough for}} contributory infringement, 464 U.S. at 439, 104 S.Ct. 774, and the encryption feature of Aimster's service prevented Deep from knowing what songs were being copied by the users of his system, <b>Aimster</b> lacked the knowledge of infringing uses that liability for contributory infringement requires. The opinion also makes clear that a service provider that fits within the characteristics of a contributory infringer does not obtain any sort of immunity by using encryption, to avoid knowledge of the unlawful purposes for which the service is being used. Actually, a tutorial for the <b>Aimster</b> software showed as its only examples of file sharing the sharing of copyrighted works, including copyrighted music that plaintiffs. This fact had implied <b>Aimster</b> continued to be affected by Aimster's users. In this sense the tutorial was nothing but an invitation to infringe this copyrighted music, same invitation that the Supreme Court found could not find in the Sony case.|$|E
5000|$|Lastly, {{the court}} {{established}} that the DMCA § 512 [...] "safe harbors" [...] were unavailable because <b>Aimster</b> had done nothing to comply reasonably with Section 512(i)'s requirement to establish a policy to terminate repeat infringers and instead even encouraged repeat infringement.|$|E
50|$|Madster (initially called <b>Aimster)</b> {{appeared}} in Napster's wake in August 2000 and {{was intended to}} be a P2P file sharing service. It was shut down in December 2002 {{as a result of a}} lawsuit by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E
5000|$|Recording {{industry}} {{owners of}} copyrights in musical performances brought contributory and vicarious infringement action, {{a type of}} secondary liability, against a website operator called <b>Aimster</b> (renamed and currently called Madster), a company such as Napster which facilitated the swapping of digital copies of songs over the internet.|$|E
5000|$|At the time, {{the use of}} the {{internet}} for music promotion was not widespread, and record labels were still reliant on MTV and radio. Capitol launched an innovative marketing campaign, broadcasting [...] "blips", short films set to Kid As music, on music channels and distributing them online. The [...] "iBlip", a Java applet, could be embedded in fan sites and allowed users to pre-order and stream the album; it was used by over 1000 sites and the album was streamed more than 400,000 times. The iBlip also included artwork, photos and links to pre-order the album on the online retailer Amazon. Capitol also streamed the album through Amazon, MTV.com and heavy.com, and for three days ran a promotional campaign with the peer-to-peer filesharing service <b>Aimster,</b> allowing users to swap iBlips and Radiohead-branded <b>Aimster</b> skins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cost-benefit}} analysis, {{first introduced}} by Judge Posner from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in the <b>Aimster</b> case, holds that {{a manufacturer of}} technological device will enjoy the Sony safe-harbor only if [...] "...it would have been disproportionately costly for him to eliminate or at least reduce substantially the infringing uses." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{for a short}} time, Capitol Records {{authorized}} Madster (which {{was called}} <b>Aimster</b> at the time) to provide some Radiohead video files on the service's Web site and to release a skin for the Madster software that had a Radiohead theme. This collaboration was done {{for the purpose of}} promoting a new Radiohead album.|$|E
5000|$|The {{court held}} {{that in this case}} the users of the systems were the direct infringers, these who are ignorant or more {{commonly}} disdainful of copyright and in any event discount the likelihood of being sued or prosecuted for copyright infringement, however companies such as <b>Aimster</b> that facilitate their infringement, even if they are not themselves direct infringers can be liable for copyright violations as contributory infringers.|$|E
50|$|In re <b>Aimster</b> Copyright Litigation, 334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit {{addressed}} copyright infringement claims brought against <b>Aimster,</b> concluding that a preliminary injunction against the file-sharing service was appropriate, because the copyright owners were likely to prevail on their claims of contributory infringement {{and the fact that the}} services was capable of having non-infringing user was not enough reason to reverse the district court's decision. The appellate court also noted that defendant could have limited the quantity of the infringements if he had eliminated an encryption system feature and if it had monitored the use of its systems. This made it so that the defense did not fall within the safe harbor of 17 U.S.C.S. § 512(i). and could not be used as an excuse to not know about the infringement. In addition, the court decided that the harm done to the plaintiff was irreparable and outweighed any harm to the defendant created by the injunction.|$|E
50|$|Contributory {{infringement}} {{has been}} the central issue in the cases involving ‘peer to peer’ services such as Napster, <b>Aimster,</b> Grokster and Morpheus. The courts have applied the Sony Betamax ratio differently in all these cases. For instance, Napster was held liable for contributory infringement. But, a similar service like Grokster was not held liable for contributory infringement as in this case, a district court, grounding its reasoning on the Sony Betamax decision, held that secondary liability could not be applied to peer to peer services.|$|E
50|$|A famous {{example of}} such a defense being denied {{occurred}} in In re <b>Aimster</b> Copyright Litigation, in which the defendants argued that the file-swapping technology was designed {{in such a way that}} they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. They suggested that their inability to monitor the activities of users meant that they could not be contributing to copyright infringement by the users. The court held that this was willful blindness on the defendant's part and would not constitute a defense to a claim of contributory infringement.|$|E
5000|$|The court {{rejected}} Aimster's {{argument that}} to prevail {{the recording industry}} should prove that some actual loss of money has occurred because of the copying that <b>Aimster</b> service's contribute in producing. The court explained that although the court, in Betamax, emphasized that the plaintiffs had failed {{to show that they}} had sustained substantial harm from Sony's video recorder, it did so in the context of assessing the argument that time shifting of television programs was fair use rather than infringement. The court believed that Betamax was not hurting the copyright owners because it was enlarging the audience for their programs, as well as advertisements. However it was also clear that even though without proving economic loss, compensation for damages can not be awarded, plaintiff could still obtain statutory damages and an injunction.|$|E
50|$|Around March 2001, {{support for}} {{encrypted}} network communications {{was included in}} a new release of the Madster software (at the time, the <b>Aimster</b> name was still in use.) Among other things, the Madster service hoped that the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act would {{have the effect of}} prohibiting others from monitoring the encrypted Madster network communications. In addition, the Madster operators argued that the encryption meant that they could not be aware of any copyright infringement that took place. Later on, around April-May 2001, a service was introduced wherein a network including {{tens of thousands of people}} could be searched for music and other content and new users would by default be added to this network although users could choose to instead restrict trading to buddy list members. At one point, the company announced a premium service that was available for US$4.95 per month.|$|E

40|$|Rights holders {{have been}} {{successful}} in every major copyright action brought against peer-to-peer (P 2 P) software providers. By 2005, those behind Napster, <b>Aimster,</b> Grokster, Morpheus and Kazaa have each been held liable for their users' infringements and effectively exited the market. But those successes did not result in any reduction in the availability of P 2 P file sharing software. In fact, the opposite occurred: soon after the U. S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of rights holders in Grokster, there was exponential {{growth in the number of}} P 2 P file sharing applications available. This Article argues that this came about because the pre-P 2 P and current U. S. secondary liability laws were and are based on a number of physical world assumptions that are simply not tenable in the software context. After identifying those assumptions, and contrasting them with the relevant software world realities, the Article demonstrates that the explosion in the number and availability of P 2 P apps can be traced directly to the Supreme Court's failure to recognize the mismatch between the two paradigms...|$|E
