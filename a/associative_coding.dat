40|$|Neural {{activity}} in orbitofrontal cortex {{has been linked}} to flexible representations of stimulus-outcome associations. Such value representations are known to emerge with learning, but the neural mechanisms supporting this phenomenon are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence for a causal role for NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in mediating spike pattern discriminability, neural plasticity, and rhythmic synchronization in relation to evaluative stimulus processing and decision making. Using tetrodes, single-unit spike trains and local field potentials were recorded during local, unilateral perfusion of an NMDAR blocker in rat OFC. In the absence of behavioral effects, NMDAR blockade severely hampered outcome-selective spike pattern formation to olfactory cues, relative to control perfusions. Moreover, NMDAR blockade shifted local rhythmic synchronization to higher frequencies and degraded its linkage to stimulus-outcome selective coding. These results demonstrate the importance of NMDARs for cue-outcome <b>associative</b> <b>coding</b> in OFC during learning and illustrate how NMDAR blockade disrupts network dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} whether music can reliably convey emotions to listeners, and - if so - what musical parameters might carry this information. Far less {{attention has been}} devoted to the actual contents of the communicative process. The goal of this article is thus to consider what types of emotional content are possible to convey in music. I will argue that the content is mainly constrained by the type of coding involved, and that distinct types of content are related to different types of coding. Based on these premises, I suggest a conceptualization in terms of ‘multiple layers’ of musical expression of emotions. The ‘core’ layer is constituted by iconically-coded basic emotions. I attempt to clarify the meaning of this concept, dispel the myths that surround it, and provide examples of how it can be heuristic in explaining findings in this domain. However, I also propose that this ‘core’ layer may be extended, qualified, and even modified by additional layers of expression that involve intrinsic and <b>associative</b> <b>coding.</b> These layers enable listeners to perceive more complex emotions - though the expressions are less cross-culturally invariant and more dependent on the social context and/or the individual listener. This multiple-layer conceptualization of expression in music can help to explain both similarities and differences between vocal and musical expression of emotions...|$|E

The first experiment, using a stimulus onset asynchrony of 250 msec, found priming in all visual field conditions, except that in which both prime and target were projected to the right hemisphere. A second experiment was conducted to determine whether this absence of right hemisphere priming was due to an inadequate interval of time between prime and target. In this experiment, a stimulus onset asynchrony of 450 msec revealed significant priming in all visual field conditions. The results suggest that lexical representations are activated more slowly in the right hemisphere than in the left...|$|R

40|$|The {{so called}} {{associative}} thinking, which humans {{are known to}} perform on every day basis, is attributed {{to the fact that}} human brain memorizes information using the dynamical system made of interconnected neurons. Retrieval of information in such a system is accomplished in associative sense; starting from an arbitrary state, which might be an encoded representation of a visual image, the brain activity converges to another state, which is stable and which is what the brain remembers. In this paper we explore the possibility of using an associative memory for the purpose of enhancing the interactive capability of perceptual vision systems. By following the biological memory principles, we show how vision systems can be designed to recognize faces, facial gestures and orientations, using low-end videocameras and little computational power.

40|$|Standard Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) stores sum-of-the-correlation-matrices of {{the pairs}} of patterns. When {{a pattern of}} an encoded pair is presented, the other is {{expected}} to be recalled. It has been shown that standard BAM cannot correctly recall a pattern pair, if it is not at a local minima of the energy function. To overcome this problem, novel methods for encoding have been proposed. The efficient novel-encoding methods require the knowledge of interference noise in the standard BAM. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for computing the exact amount of interference noise in standard encoding of BAM.

Yulia Kristeva represented conception of geno- and feno- text. Accordind her conception the geno- text it is {{the system of the}} contents and senses, mastered by an individual on the early the early stage of his development. The feno-text it's the real texts, separate phrases and expressions, different types of discourse. Roland Barthes elaborated text as dynamic phenomenon, that is in permanent motion and development and that belongs of discourse that goes out outside ordinary thinking. In any text there are five codes that organize semiotic space. R. Barthes calls the <b>associative</b> field <b>codes,</b> above text organization of senses that impose an idea about a certain structure. Jacques-Marie-?mile Lacan is the creator of the structural psychoanalysis. It was he who formulated a new understanding of the personality as originally split that feels desire in consequence of its symbolic nature. The new model of analysis in the post-structuralism offered Gilles Deleuze. He formulated a schizoanalysis theory that is to deny the idea of external influence (forced causality). Psychotherapy only begins to seize a paradigm of structuralism. But over time psychotherapy discourse still will take its place among the linguistic practices, that complement the content of postmodern ideas. ????????????? ???????? ??? ?????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ????????????????? ?????????????, ??????? ?????????? ???? ? ???????? ??? ?????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????? ?????? ? ????????. ?. ???????? ?????????????? ????????? ????- ? ????-??????. ????-??????? ??? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????, ????????? ????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ????????, ????-?????? - ??? ???????? ??????, ????????? ????? ? ????????????, ?????? ???? ????????. ?. ???? ???????????? ????? ??? ?????????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ??????? ?? ??????? ?????

40|$|Sparsely <b>coded</b> <b>associative</b> memory (SpaCAM) can be {{regarded}} as a special form of neural networks. SpaCAMs are well suited for pattern recognition and completion in such different fields as text retrieval, OCR and speech recognition. Its straightforward representation has an unbearable space demand for large pattern sets. Limited memory resources require new techniques for the representation of associative matrices. Most messages are redundant. Data compression tries to get a more compact representation by eliminating the redundancy thus reducing space or transmission time. After introducing some data structures for matrix representation the most important data compression techniques are explained in this paper. Huffman and run length codes, arithmetic coding and two lossless image compression procedures are discussed. A combination of distance coding and statistical compression seems to be an adequate mean {{to deal with the problem}} of limited memory resources. (orig.)

50|$|Although {{the models}} of {{associative}} chaining and positional coding are able to explain {{a great amount of}} behavior seen for sequence memory, they are far from perfect. For example, neither chaining nor positional coding is able to properly illustrate the details of the Ranschburg effect, which reports that sequences of items that contain repeated items are harder to reproduce than sequences of unrepeated items. Associative chaining predicts that recall of lists containing repeated items is impaired because recall of any repeated item would cue not only its true successor but also the successors of all other instances of the item. However, experimental data have shown that spaced repetition of items resulted in impaired recall of the second occurrence of the repeated item. Furthermore, it had no measurable effect on the recall of the items that followed the repeated items, contradicting the prediction of <b>associative</b> chaining. Positional <b>coding</b> predicts that repeated items will have no effect on recall, since the positions for each item in the list act as independent cues for the items, including the repeated items. That is, there is no difference between the similarity between any two items and repeated items. This, again, is not consistent with the data.|$|R
40|$|The {{working group}} "Search Technologies " at the University of Hildesheim has its main {{research}} {{focus in the}} field of pattern recognition (pattern matching, pattern completion, pattern extraction). The present participation of IMBIT in the CLEF project was based on a particular specification of our engine, namely towards "text-pattern recognition". Here, we mainly differentiate two kinds of patterns aiming at lexicographic and semantic similarities. The first kind is expressed in form of word lists where items are similar in writing (with respect to the input string). This type often is called error- (or fault-) tolerant retrieval. The second kind automatically groups word clusters-without grammar- which define concepts, ideas, events or processes. Such items normally form the content of articles, however following grammatical rules there. The technical basis is a particular artificial neural network, the SpaCAM (Sparsely <b>Coded</b> <b>Associative</b> Memory). SpaCAM has proven to work fine in many applications with text-data (like fulltext retrieval, translation memory tasks, terminology extraction etc.), but also in other contexts (like DNA retrieval, signature recognition, machine control tasks etc). Another module is called DCC-Mindmap and allows the graphic display of such word groups which mirror ideas or events, described in the normal text in underlying articles or documents.
