5|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} her husband's death, Sarah Conlon and her family decided to fight for a public apology for the {{miscarriage}} of justice on her family. Once again she led the campaign, lobbying church leaders and politicians, among them the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who pledged his support, which culminated in Tony Blair's apology to the Conlon family. Ill, {{she was unable to}} make the trip to London to hear the apology, but her children spoke to her by telephone from the House of Commons. After securing the apology, she mentioned that she no longer had to worry <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> and what it means.|$|E

25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being a relief to all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people who want to take advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) talks about a beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> for a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) talks about a woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too scared to denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories about girls that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her whatever happens. «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice. The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Ragtime was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was {{immediately}} at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe. Howard Rollins, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, [...] "I was frightened to meet Mr. Cagney. I asked him how to die {{in front of the}} camera. He said 'Just die!' It worked. Who would know more <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> than him?" [...] Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon. As filming progressed, Cagney's sciatica worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue.|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{had arrived}} in the United States in February 1997 for {{recording}} the track, where Clive Davis, who was managing his career in the United States, played him a [...] "poppier" [...] version of the song, remixed by Junior Vasquez. He also requested Barlow to perform [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] at the 1997 pre-Grammy Award party. However, the singer did not have any time to rehearse or memorize the lyrics, resulting in the performance receiving negative reviews from critics and audience alike. With The Times Barlow recounted the evening saying, [...] "I don't remember the words. I came in at all the wrong times. I can see people drifting off to the toilet in droves. Talk <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> on your arse!" [...] The combination of the negative review towards his performance and contractual obligations led to Barlow release [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] as his second single on 24 April 1997 in the United Kingdom. The CD single consisted of the single version along with the Vasquez remix and two other tracks from Open Road, [...] "Meaning Of A Love Song" [...] and [...] "Always". Another song, [...] "Cuddly Toy", was released on the B-side of another CD single for the song, released in May 1997. [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] was also remixed by DJs Cuca and Monster Makers, and was released in a CD single in June 1997.|$|E

Khaleej Times said [...] " [...] This wonderful work of art, nuanced and magical in its portrayal, is <b>about</b> <b>dying.</b> But Ethan, as played by Hrithik Roshan in Guzaarish, is so bemused by adversity that he can actually look at his own suffering with dispassionate humour." [...] Deccan Herald noted that only select - audience may find the movie appealing saying that [...] "the performances stand out. Hrithik Roshan does brings some tears to your eyes and even Aishwarya comes up with an original act. But, as said, the blacks and greys of Guzaarish might appeal only to Bhansali viewers." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the American Civil War, minstrels {{remained}} mostly neutral and satirized both sides. However, as the war reached Northern soil, troupes turned their loyalties to the Union. Sad songs and sketches came to dominate in reflection of the mood of a bereaved nation. Troupes performed skits <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> soldiers and their weeping widows, and about mourning white mothers. [...] "When this cruel war is over" [...] became the hit of the period, selling over a million copies of sheet music. To balance the somber mood, minstrels put on patriotic numbers like [...] "The Star Spangled Banner", accompanied by depictions of scenes from American history that lionized figures like George Washington and Andrew Jackson. Social commentary grew increasingly important to the show. Performers criticized Northern society and those they felt responsible for the breakup of the country, who opposed reunification, or who profited from a nation at war. Emancipation was either opposed through happy plantation material or mildy supported with pieces that depicted slavery in a negative light. Eventually, direct criticism of the South became more biting.|$|E

6000|$|SECOND EPOCH; GET GRADUALLY CUT LOOSE FROM POLAND: A.D. 1139-1159. Twenty {{years of}} great trouble in Poland, which were of lasting benefit to Schlesien. In 1139 the Polack King, a very potent Majesty whom we could name but do not, died; {{and left his}} Dominions shared by {{punctual}} bequest among his five sons. Punctual bequest did avail: but the eldest Son (who was King, and had Schlesien with much else to his share) began to encroach, to grasp; upon which the others rose upon him, flung him out into exile; redivided; and hoped now they might have quiet. Hoped, but were disappointed; and could come to no sure bargain for the next twenty years,--not till [...] "the eldest brother," [...] first author of these strifes, [...] "died an exile in Holstein," [...] or was just <b>about</b> <b>dying,</b> and had agreed to take Schlesien for all claims, and be quiet thenceforth.|$|E
6000|$|To Platt and Parsons he {{affected}} {{an attitude}} of seasoned depravity towards womankind. Platt and Parsons were his contemporary apprentices in departments of the drapery shop, and the three were drawn together into a close friendship {{by the fact that}} all their names began with P. They decided they were the Three Ps, and went about together of an evening with the bearing of desperate dogs. Sometimes, when they had money, they went into public houses and had drinks. Then they would become more desperate than ever, and walk along the pavement under the gas lamps arm in arm singing. Platt had a good tenor voice, and had been in a church choir, and so he led the singing; Parsons had a serviceable bellow, which roared and faded and roared again very wonderfully; Mr. Polly's share was an extraordinary lowing noise, a sort of flat recitative which he called [...] "singing seconds." [...] They would have sung catches if they had known how to do it, but as it was they sang melancholy music hall songs <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> soldiers and the old folks far away.|$|E

60|$|He {{can only}} get away from death by {{continually}} stepping {{within an inch of}} it. A soldier surrounded by enemies, if he is to cut his way out, needs to combine a strong desire for living with a strange carelessness <b>about</b> <b>dying.</b> He must not merely cling to life, for then he will be a coward, and will not escape. He must not merely wait for death, for then he will be a suicide, and will not escape. He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it; he must desire life like water and yet drink death like wine. No philosopher, I fancy, has ever expressed this romantic riddle with adequate lucidity, and I certainly have not done so. But Christianity has done more: it has marked the limits of it in the awful graves of the suicide and the hero, showing the distance between him who dies for the sake of living and him who dies for the sake of dying. And it has held up ever since above the European lances the banner of the mystery of chivalry: the Christian courage, which is a disdain of death; not the Chinese courage, which is a disdain of life.|$|E
6000|$|Marischal {{continued}} in Spain, corresponding, sending news (the Prussian Archives alone know what), {{for nearly a}} couple of years. [Returned [...] "April, 1762" [...] (Friedrich's Letter to him, [...] "10th April, 1762:" [...] in OEuvres de Frederic, xx. 285).] His Embassy had one effect, which is of interest to us here. On his way out, he had gone by London, {{with a view of}} getting legal absolution for his Jacobitism,--so far, at least, as to be able to inherit the Earldom of Kintore, which is likely to fall vacant soon. By blood it is his, were the Jacobite incapacities withdrawn. Kintore is a cadet branch of the Keiths; [...] "John, younger Son of William Sixth Lord Marischal," [...] was the first Kintore. William Sixth's younger Son, yes;--and William's Father, a man always venerable to me, had (A.D. 1593) founded Marischal College, Aberdeen,--where, for a few, in those stern granite Countries, the Diviner Pursuits are still possible (thank God and this Keith) on frugal oatmeal. MARISCHAL-COLLEGE Keith, or FIFTH Lord Marischal, was grandfather's grandfather of our Potsdam Friend, who is tenth and last. [Douglas's Scotch Peerage, pp. 448 et seq., 387 et seq.] Honor to the brave and noble, now fallen silent under foot NOT of the nobler! In a word, the fourth Kintore was <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> childless; and Marischal had come by London on that heritage business.|$|E
6000|$|But the blackbrowed Marseillese {{have struck}} down the Tyrant of the Chateau. He is struck down; low, and hardly to rise. What a moment for an august Legislative was that when the Hereditary Representative entered, under such circumstances; and the Grenadier, {{carrying}} the little Prince Royal out of the Press, set {{him down on the}} Assembly-table! A moment,--which one had to smooth off with oratory; waiting what the next would bring! Louis said few words: [...] "He was come hither to prevent a great crime; he believed himself safer nowhere than here." [...] President Vergniaud answered briefly, in vague oratory as we say, about [...] "defence of Constituted Authorities," [...] <b>about</b> <b>dying</b> at our post. (Moniteur, Seance du 10 Aout 1792.) And so King Louis sat him down; first here, then there; for a difficulty arose, the Constitution not permitting us to debate while the King is present: finally he settles himself with his Family in the 'Loge of the Logographe' in the Reporter's-Box of a Journalist: which is beyond the enchanted Constitutional Circuit, separated from it by a rail. To such Lodge of the Logographe, measuring some ten feet square, with a small closet at the entrance of it behind, is the King of broad France now limited: here can he and his sit pent, under the eyes of the world, or retire into their closet at intervals; for the space of sixteen hours. Such quiet peculiar moment has the Legislative lived to see.|$|E
