2500|$|Hughie [...] "Ee-yah" [...] Jennings led the Tigers {{to three}} {{consecutive}} American League pennants, in 1907–08–09. [...] Jennings continued {{to manage the}} Tigers through the 1920 season, though his team never won another pennant. [...] During his years as Detroit's manager, Jennings became famous for his antics, mostly in the third base coaching box, which variously included shouts of [...] "Ee-Yah", and other whoops, whistles, horns, gyrations, jigs, and grass-plucking. [...] The [...] "Ee-Yah" [...] whoop became his trademark and was accompanied with waves of both <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head and a sharp raising of his right knee. [...] In 1907, he was suspended for taunting opponents with a tin whistle. [...] The [...] "Ee-Yah" [...] shouts continued and became such a trademark that Jennings became known as Hughie [...] "Ee-Yah" [...] Jennings, and Detroit fans would shout [...] "Ee-Yah" [...] when Jennings would appear on the field.

60|$|But {{the strange}} man who stood before him folded his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast.|$|E
60|$|Father Benwell {{folded his}} <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast--looked with {{immovable}} resolution straight in Romayne's face--and struck the blow {{which he had}} been meditating for months past.|$|E
60|$|And {{there on}} the landing she saw him {{standing}} in the darkness with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, as if fending a blow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I can't bear to cut Hal out!" [...] said Sam, putting <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{as a way}} he {{considered}} secret of disposing of his tears.|$|R
60|$|She kneeled {{down beside}} it, passed her <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> neck, and drew {{his face to}} hers. She knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said nothing to him.|$|R
60|$|With his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, {{he pushed}} forward once more, not knowing whether {{he might be}} {{retracing}} his steps, or proceeding in the proper direction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Phew! but aint it cold!" [...] exclaimed Tom, {{dancing around}} and {{slapping}} his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest. [...] "I wonder how Nellie and Grace Laning like this?" ...|$|E
60|$|Maurice paused: once more, with {{a gesture}} {{habitual}} to him, he crossed his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest and resumed his restless march {{up and down the}} narrow room.|$|E
6000|$|She put her <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, {{and touched}} the plaster on his neck gently with her finger. [...] "There's one thing I don't doubt," [...] she said: [...] "the Captain did that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor pulled <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} sat down again. Presently he was saying with a long face: [...] "I came here to {{denounce}} the cause of your unhappiness, and I begin to see it is myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oswald," [...] {{said his}} wife, getting up, and putting her <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, [...] "you {{know you would}} give your best horse to Mr. Finn, {{as long as he}} chose to stay here, though you rode upon a donkey yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|To the {{surprise}} of the Interpreter, Mark Breezy crossed his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast, and firmly said--"No!" [...] Swiftly understanding his motive, our seaman and Ebony followed suit with an equally emphatic, [...] "No!" ...|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Many will forsake {{the truth}} {{before the world}} is pulled down. [Stretching out his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head.] I pulled down my own house, now I go out to pull down the world.|$|E
60|$|FERRAND. [Brushing his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes.] Pardon, Monsieur--your goodness--I am {{a little}} weak. [He opens his coat, and shows a belt drawn very tight over his ragged shirt.] I tighten him one hole for each meal, during two days now. That gives you courage.|$|E
6000|$|... "She fell an' hurt herself," [...] Seth said hurriedly to Gladys, as he obeyed {{the little}} woman's injunction. And then, {{as the latter}} put her uninjured <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> neck, he tried to aid the {{movement}} by clasping her waist.|$|R
60|$|At this {{threatening}} {{stage of}} the discourse, Jo, {{who seems to have}} been gradually going out of his mind, smears <b>his</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face and gives a terrible yawn. Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he is a limb of the arch-fiend.|$|R
60|$|They parted with {{an embrace}} {{that would have}} {{fortified}} older married people for a year's separation. When Bartley came back, she handed him the leaf she had torn out of his book, and sat down beside him while he read it, with her <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Martin-Roget {{crossed his}} <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad chest and {{clutched}} his elbows {{with his hands}} with an obvious effort to keep control over his movements and his temper in check. The quiet, almost indifferent attitude of the girl was exasperating to his over-strung nerves.|$|E
60|$|But {{although}} his tormentor utterly failed {{to move him}} by fair means, he knew of a foul method which proved successful. He crossed Ted's <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast, and attempted to draw them as far over as possible, with the view, apparently, of tying them into a knot.|$|E
60|$|But {{they were}} not yet done with the shore and {{the horror of the}} yellow flag. About midway of the pass there was a cry and a scurry, a man was seen to leap upon the rail, and, {{throwing}} his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, to stoop and plunge into the sea.|$|E
60|$|She turned; her <b>arm</b> fell <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder; she {{buried her}} head in his breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't lie on {{that cold}} stone, Ben; {{come here and}} {{let me try to}} comfort you," [...] she said, stooping to wipe away the great drops that kept rolling down the brown cheek half hidden in her dress. But Ben put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, and sobbed out with a fresh burst of grief,-- ...|$|R
60|$|PRITCHARD throws slip-noose over OAKHURST from behind; OAKHURST {{puts his}} hand in his breast as the slip-noose is drawn across his bosom, pinioning one <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast, and the other at his side. SILKY and SOAPY, {{directed}} by PRITCHARD, drag OAKHURST to chair facing front, and pinion his legs. PRITCHARD, C., regarding him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do it {{some other}} day," [...] said the young fellow, yawning and {{throwing}} up his little lean <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head. [...] "No, {{there was no}} fight; but there was chanting. Bingley chanted, I chanted, the General chanted--Costigan I mean.--Did you ever hear him sing 'The Little Pig under the Bed,' Pen?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{slid down}} the rubbish, {{struggled}} to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently with his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.|$|E
60|$|Then {{a sudden}} thought seemed to strike him, he threw back his head, gave a short laugh {{as if he}} were pleased with this new thought, then turned, meeting Mistress de Chavasse's stern gaze {{squarely}} and fully. He threw his hat down upon the steps and crossed his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest.|$|E
50|$|The {{attacker}} stands either facing directly one {{of his/her}} opponent's sides or slightly behind in an angle. He places the opponent's near <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, grabs a waistlock, and then lifts the opponent up while falling backwards, causing the opponent {{to land on}} his/her neck and shoulders. Its name is derived from and innovated by Masa Saito.|$|R
60|$|She wasted as {{much time}} as {{possible}} in the shops, then they took the tram home again. Ciccio paid the three fares, laying his hand restrainingly on Gigi's hand, when Gigi's hand sought pence in his trouser pocket, and throwing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> friend's shoulder, in affectionate but vulgar triumph, when the fares were paid. Alvina was on her high horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] he exclaimed, {{looking up}} {{suddenly}} at her taunt. She {{knew she was}} playing false; she put the ring on her finger and went {{across the room to}} Leslie, laying her <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, and leaning her head against him, murmuring softly to him. He, poor fellow, was delighted with her, for she did not display her fondness often.|$|R
60|$|At a {{sign from}} the Captain, John, with a shameless leer, advanced, and stood passively upon the grating, while the bare-headed old quarter-master, with grey hair {{streaming}} in the wind, bound {{his feet to}} the cross-bars, and, stretching out his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, secured them to the hammock-nettings above. He then retreated a little space, standing silent.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me with the first honest {{expression}} that had crossed his face in my presence--an expression of blank amazement. I could see that I sank in his estimation as a dangerous man from that moment. He shut up the drawer at once, folded his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast, and listened to me with a smile of satirical attention.|$|E
60|$|The man upon me held me down awkwardly, {{leaving me}} many openings--one of which I was not slow in taking {{advantage}} of, so that almost before the fellow knew that I was awake I was upon my feet with my <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders {{and about his}} waist and had hurled him heavily over my head to the hard rubble of the beach, where he lay quite still.|$|E
60|$|And {{then from}} the box that lay so quietly in the corner, a sudden catch was audible, like the catch of a clock before it strikes the hour. For one second the two {{stared at each other}} with lifted brows and stony eyes. Then Harry, {{throwing}} one <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, with the other clutched the girl to his breast and staggered against the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{thinking}} more, papa, of you," [...] she said putting her <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. [...] "You {{have always been}} so good to me, and so kind!" [...] Here his heart misgave him, for he felt that {{during the last week}} he had not been kind to her. [...] "But you would not wish me to give myself to a man and then not to care for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By these ten finger-bones! {{there were}} some fine bowmen at the intaking of Calais," [...] said Aylward. [...] "I well {{remember}} that, on occasion of an outfall, a Genoan raised <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mantlet, and shook it at us, a hundred paces from our line. There were twenty who loosed shafts at him, and when the man was afterwards slain {{it was found that}} he had taken eighteen through his forearm." ...|$|R
