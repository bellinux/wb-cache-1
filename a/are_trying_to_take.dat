2500|$|Continuing the play-within-a-play structure, the Illusionist {{presents}} the remaining {{events of the}} day in scenes which the astonished participants themselves watch from behind the pillar. [...] The Chamberlain just has time to prepare Ondine for her reception with the king. Ondine is particularly advised not to mention the wart on the king's nose. [...] Ondine tactlessly mentions that the Chamberlain's hand is damp and constantly interrupts him to talk to Bertram with whom she immediately establishes a rapport. [...] At the king's reception Ondine cannot take her eyes off Bertha. [...] She accuses Bertha of trying to steal Hans from her. [...] The King says, “Bertha only wants to be your friend.” [...] Ondine replies, “You are entirely mistaken! [...] Bertha is a hypocrite. [...] She flatters you constantly. [...] Has she ever dared to speak to you about...the wart on your nose?” [...] In panic, the Chamberlain clears the room. [...] Ondine is alone with the king. [...] The king asks, “Who are you, Ondine?” [...] Ondine explains everything and says that she weeps because “they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Hans away from me.” [...] But what if they did, the king asks. [...] “would that be such a misfortune?” [...] Ondine answers, “Oh yes. [...] If he deceives me, he will die.” [...] The king says, “Men have been known to survive such things.” [...] “Not this one,” Ondine replies.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 April {{at a rally}} by Bakiyev {{in front}} of a 1,000 {{supporters}} gunshots were heard, although Bakiyev was reported to have safely left the scene. Some claimed that the firing came from his own bodyguards {{in order to keep the}} peace and avoid a confrontation with opponents. Later in the day Bakiyev was reported to have flown into exile to the Kazakhstani city of Taraz. it was said that he would continue negotiations on a settlement to the crisis from exile. The interim government responded to this by calling his departure a [...] "deportation," [...] saying he had allegedly submitted a request to resign amid reports indicating that Baktybek Kaliyev, a former defence minister, had been arrested. The interim government also said it would seek Bakiyev's transfer to a Kyrgyz or international court for trial at a later date. Kazakhstan, as the chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, confirmed Bakiyev's departure saying it was an important step towards preventing civil war. It added that joint efforts between themselves and Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama had fostered such an agreement. Bakiyev submitted a hand-written resignation letter saying [...] "I tender my resignation in these tragic days as I understand the full scale of my responsibility for the future of the Kyrgyz people." [...] The interim president allegedly said [...] "he had become a source of instability ... they could no longer tolerate that." [...] She added that most of his entourage was still in the country and that she would press ahead with bringing Bakyiev to trial. On 20 April, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko said his country had afforded Bakiyev and three members of his family [...] "the protection of our state, and personally of the president." [...] On 21 April, in a statement from Minsk, Bakiyev said he still considers himself the country's president and pledged to do all he can to return the country to its [...] "constitutional field." [...] He then upped the ante by saying, [...] "I do not recognise my resignation. Nine months ago the people of Kyrgyzstan elected me their president and there is no power that can stop me. Only death can stop me." [...] He then called on the international community not to support the interim government. [...] "Everyone must know the bandits who <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> power are the executors of an external force and have no legitimacy. I call on leaders of the international community: do not set a precedent and do not recognise this gang as the legitimate authorities." [...] Russia consequently rejected this assertion on the grounds that he had already tendered his resignation saying [...] "this document cannot be rejected by a verbal [...] statement." [...] He also accused the Russians of being annoyed with his allowing the Manas air base to continue operating for the Americans and NATO to supply their forces in the Afghan war. [...] On 23 April, Bakiyev backtracked on his vow to return to power, but claimed his resignation is invalid because the new government is failing to protect his family as was promised.|$|E

60|$|For {{understand}} this well, young men, and settle {{it in your}} hearts as the first condition of human life, yea, {{of the life of}} every rational created being, that a man is justified only by faith; and not only a man, but angels, archangels, and all possible created spirits, past, present, and to come. All stand, all are in their right state, only {{as long as they are}} consciously dependent on God the Father of spirits and his Son Jesus Christ the Lord, in whom they live and move and have their being. The moment they attempt to assert themselves, whether their own power, their own genius, their own wisdom, or even their own virtue, they ipso facto sin, and are justified and just no longer; because they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> themselves out of their just and right state of dependence, and to put themselves into an unjust and wrong state of independence. To assert that anything is their own, to assert that their virtue is their own, just as much as to assert that their wisdom, or any other part of their being, is their own, is to deny the primary fact of their existence--that in God they live and move and have that being. And therefore Milton's Satan, though, over and above all his other grandeurs, he had been adorned with every virtue, would have been Satan still by the one sin of ingratitude, just because and just as long as he set up himself, apart from that God from whom alone comes every good and perfect gift.|$|E
6000|$|Owe no man {{anything}} save love, for He owed no man anything. He gave up all, even His own rights, for a time, for His subjects. Will you {{pretend to}} follow Him while you hold back from your brothers and fellow-servants their just due? One debt you must always owe; one debt will grow {{the more you}} pay it, and become more delightful to owe, the greater and heavier you feel it to be, and that is love; love to all around you, for all around you are your brothers and sisters; all around you are the beloved subjects of your King and Saviour. Love them as you love yourself, and then you cannot harm them, you cannot tyrannise over them, you cannot wish to rise by scrambling up on their shoulders, taking the bread out of their mouths, making your profit out of their weakness and their need. This, St. Paul says, was the duty of men in his time, because the night of heathendom was far spent, the day of Christianity and the Church was at hand. Much more is it our duty now--our duty, who have been born in the full sunshine of Christianity, christened into His church as children, we and our fathers before us, for generations, {{of the kingdom of}} God. Ay, my friends, these words, that kingdom, that King, witness this day against this land of England. Not merely against popery, the mote which we <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> out of the foreigner's eye, but against Mammon, the beam which we are overlooking in our own. Owe no man anything save love. [...] "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." [...] That is the law of your King, who loved not Himself or His own profit, His own glory, but gave Himself even to death for those who had forgotten Him and rebelled against Him. That law witnesses against selfishness and idleness in rich and poor. It witnesses against the employer who grinds down his workmen; who, as the world tells him he has a right to do, takes advantage of their numbers, their ignorance, their low and reckless habits, to rise upon their fall, and grow rich out of their poverty. It witnesses against the tradesman who tries to draw away his neighbour's custom. It witnesses against the working man who spends in the alehouse the wages which might support and raise his children, and then falls back recklessly and dishonestly on the parish rates and the alms of the charitable. Against them all this law witnesses. These things are unfit for the kingdom of Christ, contrary to the laws and constitution thereof, hateful to the King thereof; and if a nation will not amend these abominations, the King will arise out of His place, and with sore judgments and terrible He will visit His land and purify His temple, saying: [...] "My Father's house should be a house of prayer, and ye have made it a den of thieves." [...] Ay, woe to any soul, or to any nation, which, instead of putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, copying His example, obeying His laws, and living worthy of His kingdom, not only in the church, but in the market, the shop, the senate, or the palace, give themselves up to covetousness, which is idolatry; and care only to make provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. Woe to them; for, let them be what they will, their King cannot change. He is still meek and lowly; He is still just and having salvation; and He will purge out of His kingdom all that is not like Himself, the unchaste and the idle, the unjust and the unmerciful, and the covetous man, who is an idolater, says the scripture, though he may call himself seven times a Protestant, and rail at the Pope in public meetings, while he justifies greediness and tyranny by glib words about the necessities of business and the laws of trade, and by philosophy falsely so called, which cometh not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. Such a man loves and makes a lie, and the Lord of truth will surely send him to his own place.|$|E
