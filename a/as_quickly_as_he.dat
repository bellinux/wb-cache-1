5|$|Hopton {{arrived on}} 27 November, given by King Charles 1,580 horse, but only around 2,000 conscripted {{infantry}} and 500 troops {{recently returned from}} fighting in Munster, Ireland. Hopton had been ordered in late September to make secure Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire, and to push {{as far as possible}} toward London. Toward this end, Hopton spread his men across Hampshire County, quartering them for the winter at Winchester, Alresford, Petersfield and Alton. He did so to alleviate the burden on any one town, and because winter was approaching quickly. However, this left his army vulnerable. Hopton placed Crawford in charge of Alton, and on 1 December Crawford began to fortify the small town <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. Crawford had at his disposal one cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment, though his exact number of men is unknown; it was likely around 1,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all bishops and priests. In the judgment of historian Roger Rees, there was no logical necessity for this second edict; that Diocletian issued one indicates that he was either unaware the first edict was being carried out, or that {{he felt it was}} not working <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> needed it to. Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, bishops, and exorcists forced upon it. Eusebius writes that the edict netted so many priests that ordinary criminals were crowded out, and had to be released.|$|E

25|$|Just <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> became popular, Rattenbury and his {{architecture}} {{was out of}} favour. Perhaps {{a symptom}} of his waning popularity, he lost the competition to build the Saskatchewan Legislative Building, built 1908–1912 in Regina, to E. and W.S. Maxwell, two Montreal architects trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In contrast to the Maxwells, Rattenbury had no formal training in architecture and, with the increasing professionalism of the field, was soon outpaced by better-trained and better-educated architects.|$|E

Several years later, while sitting in a café, he sees a young boy who reminds him {{of himself as a}} child passing on the street with his mother, who he realizes is Lara. Before he can reach the pair, he suffers a fatal heart attack. Lara brings young Yuri to view his father's body, and as the two near their home, she realizes that Joseph Stalin's NKVD is waiting to place her under arrest. Pretending they're playing a game, she urges her son to run away <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can before she surrenders to the authorities.|$|E

Hoge, {{commanding}} officer of the Combat Command B, 9th Armored Division. Hoge joined them <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. Engemen was cautiously considering his options when Hoge ordered him to immediately move into town and to capture the bridge as quickly as possible. Timmermann had been promoted only the night before to commander of Company A, and Engemen ordered him to take Co. A/14th Cavalry and a company of dismounted infantry into Remagen. Hoge had no intelligence on the number and size of German forces on the east bank. The standing bridge could have been a trap. Hoge risked losing men if the Germans allowed U.S. forces to cross before destroying it and isolating the American troops on the east bank. But the opportunity was too great to pass up.|$|E

25|$|By 12:30p.m., Carr's second brigade, Vandever's, {{arrived at}} Elkhorn. The Federal {{division}} commander immediately launched this unit in a counterattack on Price's right flank. Superior numbers of Southerners eventually forced Vandever {{to pull back}} a short distance uphill. At 2:00p.m. Van Dorn found out that McCulloch's division would not be meeting Price's at Elkhorn. At this time, Henry Little, on his own initiative, waved his 1st Missouri Brigade forward and the Rebel advance began to roll uphill. These events finally convinced Van Dorn to take more aggressive action. Price was wounded but remained in charge of his left wing while Van Dorn took tactical control of the Confederate right wing. But more time was lost in reorganizing Price's division to attack. Meanwhile, Curtis was rushing small units to Carr's assistance <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. Carr himself was wounded three times: in the ankle, neck and arm, but refused to leave the field. In 1894 he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions this day.|$|E

There were no marks on him on the night that suggested he had been in a fight. No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered. He had not driven to the farm <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid. There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Bamber had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killing and since.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] letter, [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] supplanted [...] "Leather Apron" [...] as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer. The name [...] "Jack" [...] was already used to describe another fabled London attacker: [...] "Spring-heeled Jack", who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came. The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the Axeman of New Orleans, the Boston Strangler, and the Beltway Sniper. Examples derived from Jack the Ripper include the French Ripper, the Düsseldorf Ripper, the Camden Ripper, the Blackout Ripper, Jack the Stripper, the Yorkshire Ripper, and the Rostov Ripper. Sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers.|$|E
500|$|One {{topic of}} {{discussion}} was the bill's requirement that an eagle appear on larger U.S. coins. Linderman had requested an amendment to require that gold and silver coins bear a statement of their weight and fineness, which would mean sacrificing the eagle. California's Eugene Casserly opposed the amendment, which was sponsored by Sherman, stating [...] "it will hardly be possible {{to think of a}} half dollar or a quarter dollar as being such a coin without the eagle upon it". The eagle was saved when the amendment failed, 24 in favor and 26 against. Casserly was less successful with an amendment to remove entirely the reduced coinage charge of [...]2 percent, which failed. Sherman moved the bill along <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, and it passed without a recorded vote. [...] The House initially refused to agree to the Trade dollar; representatives of both houses, led by Sherman and Potter, met in a conference committee, and the House acceded to the Senate amendment for the Trade dollar. The bill passed both houses without further debate, and was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on February 12, 1873. At no point in its almost three-year journey through the legislative process did the bill provide for the retention of the standard silver dollar, into which depositors could have their bullion coined.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the matches}} against Carlton, the Waratahs adopted Australian rules, {{and for a}} time, the colonial game {{threatened}} to supersede rugby in Sydney. Coulthard accepted an invitation from Phil Sheridan, a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground, to travel to Sydney {{with the aim of}} fostering Australian rules in the city. On 15 September 1877, soon after his arrival, Coulthard joined several local footballers on a fishing trip in Sydney Harbour. The group was anchored near Shark Island when Coulthard, sitting on the boat's gunwale {{with the back of his}} tailcoat hanging over the side, was pulled overboard by [...] "a monster shark, 13 feet long". The shark had seized his coattails trailing on the water and dragged him beneath the surface [...] "some ten or twelve feet" [...] until it tore the coat from his body. After kicking at the shark, Coulthard swam to the surface alongside the boat, [...] "into which he threw, with the aid of his friends, a kind of somersault, just about <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had been taken overboard."

2500|$|In September 54 BC, Julia, the {{daughter}} of Caesar and wife of Pompey, died while giving birth to a girl, who also died a few days later. Plutarch wrote that Caesar {{felt that this was}} the end of his good relationship with Pompey. The news created factional discord and unrest in Rome as it was thought that the death brought the end of the ties between Caesar and Pompey. The campaign of Crassus against Parthia was disastrous. Shortly after the death of Julia, Crassus died at the Battle of Carrhae (May 53 BC). This brought the first triumvirate to an end. Plutarch thought that fear of Crassus had led to Pompey and Caesar to be decent to each other, and his death {{paved the way for the}} subsequent friction between these two men and the events that eventually led to civil war. Florus wrote: [...] "Caesar's power now inspired the envy of Pompey, while Pompey's eminence was offensive to Caesar; Pompey could not brook an equal or Caesar a superior." [...] Seneca wrote that with regard to Caesar, Pompey [...] "would ill endure that anyone besides himself should become a great power in the state, and one who was likely to place a check upon his advancement, which he had regarded as onerous even when each gained by the other's rise: yet within three days' time he resumed his duties as general, and conquered his grief [...] <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was wont to conquer everything else." ...|$|E
