40|$|Serologic {{testing is}} {{essential}} for the diagnosis of some infectious diseases and yet is fraught with potential pitfalls. All parts of the diagnostic process must be optimized to ensure that serologic tests perform adequately. Recognizing that a lack of clinical data and correctly timed, paired sera frequently led to uninterpretable serology results at our laboratory, we developed and implemented simple <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> for serologic tests. We assessed the impact of these criteria by comparing submissions and results for the year before and the year after implementation of the criteria. The number of serologic tests performed declined by 25 % after implementation of the <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria,</b> despite an increase in requests for serologic tests. Inappropriate testing of acute-phase sera alone fell from 49 to 0 % (P < 0. 001) for the tests monitored. Appropriate submission of paired sera rose from 9 to 19 % (P = 0. 006). The proportion of results classified as interpretable rose from 52 to 100 % (P < 0. 001). We recommend that <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> be developed and applied to samples submitted to clinical microbiology laboratories for serologic testing...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patient {{satisfaction}} is a commonly measured indicator of quality emergency care. However, the existing empirical literature on emergency department (ED) patient satisfaction provides little guidance {{on how to}} analyze, interpret, and use data obtained in the clinical setting. Using two EDs as examples, the authors describe practical strategies designed to identify priority areas for potential improvement. METHODS: The authors used a cross-sectional, observational design. All patients who presented for emergency care during the designated time periods were eligible. Patients were randomly selected, contacted by telephone, and surveyed using three measures of global satisfaction, 23 perceived quality-of-care indicators, and six perceived wait times. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Comparisons were made {{of each of the}} perceived care and wait time indicators against explicitly defined <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> to determine satisfiers/dissatisfiers. Each indicator was correlated with the three global satisfaction indices. The authors integrated results obtained from applying the <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> with those obtained from the correlations to yield priority indicators for remediation and maintenance strategies. RESULTS: For hospitals A and B, respectively, 15 (52 %) and 16 (55 %) of perceived care and wait time indicators failed to meet <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria.</b> Using the correlations with overall satisfaction, the authors further narrowed the priority areas for remediation to six indicators for hospital A and three indicators for hospital B. One maintenance indicator was revealed for hospital A and four for hospital B. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of applying explicit <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> to descriptive statistics and using correlation coefficients with overall satisfaction can help to maximize the usefulness of patient satisfaction data by uncovering priority areas. These priority areas were broken down into maintenance and remediation indicators and were found to vary considerably depending on the hospital in question. Such strategies can help to refine performance improvement efforts by targeting those domains with the greatest impact on overall satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the cost of}} breaking ECC under the following assumptions: (1) ECC is using a standardized elliptic curve that was actually chosen by an attacker; (2) the attacker is aware of a vulnerability in some curves that are not publicly known to be vulnerable. This cost includes the cost of exploiting the vulnerability, but also the initial cost of computing a curve suitable for sabotaging the standard. This initial cost depends upon the <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> used by the public {{to decide whether to}} allow a curve as a standard, and (in most cases) also upon the chance of a curve being vulnerable. This paper shows the importance of accurately modeling the actual acceptability criteria: i. e., figuring out what the public can be fooled into accepting. For example, this paper shows that plausible models of the 2 ̆ 2 Brainpool <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> 2 ̆ 2 allow the attacker to target a one-in-a-million vulnerability.

40|$|With {{the goal}} to objectively {{demonstrate}} the {{fitness for purpose}} of a simulation model during its valida-tion, the desire arises to remove vagueness from the terms “fitness” and “purpose”. Several approaches have been presented in the past trying to facilitate and motivate the documentation of "well-defined intended purposes", but still in defense practice a precise purpose specification for a simulation model is rare. Within the methodology developed {{under the umbrella of}} WEAG THALES JP 11. 20 “REVVA”, the concept of the “Target of Acceptance” (ToA) was in-troduced, enabling clear traceableness between the vague intended purpose and precise, quite objectively assessable <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria.</b> Based on the notion of the Experimental Frame, this paper extends the approach taken in REVVA and proposes a method how to hierarchically derive from the intended purpose a number of sub-objectives of model use, until repre-sentative sets of experimental conditions can be defined, under which the simulation model needs to be valid.

40|$|The REVVA methodology, {{developed}} in the WEAG THALES Joint Program 11. 20, provides a framework for verification and validation activities resulting in an acceptance recommendation for data, models and simulations. The core of the methodology is the decomposition of the 'intended purpose' into <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> (AC). The V&V effort focuses on determining whether these criteria are met. The AC are made quantifiable by Measures of Effectiveness, and through a further decomposition into Measures of Performance and Dimensional Properties. It often {{turns out to be}} a highly subjective effort to quantify the items of evidence underlying the various measures. Around the turn of the century SISO sponsored two study groups on a common fidelity definition and implementation. The work of these study groups resulted in two significant reports stressing the importance of fidelity definition and measurements within any VV&A process. Based upon this work, amongst others, TNO Defense, Safety and Security developed a methodology to systematically define, specify and measure simulation fidelity.

The following points summarize the reasons why no endpoints were selected from the open literature. The study had endpoints that were higher than those used from the studies submitted to the Agency The study was an efficacy-type study with no endpoints. There was insufficient information on the test material in the study report to determine concentration levels tested for either the active ingredient and/or the glyphosate acid equivalent. The study appeared to have lower endpoints; however, it was not clear whether or not the study protocols were adequate. These studies were considered in the risk description and compared to the estimated exposures as a conservative check on the risk estimations conducted from the submitted studies. Some study endpoints were not relevant for assessment of risk to the CRLF (e. g., marine/estuarine endpoints). The quantitative expression of exposure in the study could not be transformed to values that could be compared to the exposure values used in this assessment.
