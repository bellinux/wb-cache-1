40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{understand}} the dynamics that bring forth the production <b>and</b> reduction of <b>care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis. <b>Care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis not only coincide, they reinforce and recall each other. Sometimes care workers however produce situations in which these phenomena are pushed back, situations in which trust and initiative – the opposite of <b>care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis – appear. Pushing back <b>care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis is linked to a style of work: establishing contact from a starting point of acceptance; looking for opportunities for affirmation; marking (small) progress. <b>Care</b> avoidance <b>and</b> <b>care</b> paralysis cannot thrive under conditions as: the proximity between the local population <b>and</b> <b>care</b> facilities; the committed involvement of professionals to a fixed territory; a network wherein signals (of nuisance or deprivation) and actions can be linked; discretional space for professionals to develop initiatives; a small-scale service level so that key figures from the local population and professionals of the care facilities can axially know each other; and finally a moral framework where indifference is brought up for discussion...|$|R

His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, <b>and</b> <b>caring</b> for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor.

In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores <b>and</b> <b>caring</b> work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time.

The males of the species were highly territorial and would guard water-filled tree holes used for breeding.
