40|$|A {{methodology}} using fractals {{to measure}} vegetation complexity in three regions of Alaska is presented. Sub- jective, binomial (0 = simple, 1 = complex) classifications {{of the complexity}} of mapped vegetation polygon patterns within continuous forest inventory plots measured in the regions were made by interpreters of aerial photographs. The fractal dimensions of the vegetation patterns within the plots then were estimated. Subse- quently, the subjective classifications of the photo-interpreted plots were regressed against fractal dimension by using logistic regression. Assessment of interobserver agreement among the <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpreters,</b> by using estimated unweighted Kappa coefficients, indicated substantial classification agreement among observers. Examination of general versus regional applicability of the logisticmodels provided strong support for ap- plicability of a single model to all three regions. The logistic model provides numerical identification of the division between simple and complex patterns. Possible applications beyond the needs of the study are dis- cussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|After {{earning his}} Ph.D. Buddington {{had a series}} of brief appointments. He was first a {{postdoctoral}} fellow at Princeton, but in 1917 he took a position teaching at Brown. In early 1918, with World War I raging, he returned to Princeton to teach military aerial observation in its aviation ground school. Specifically he taught map-reading, range-finding, and telegraphy. In April he enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army's Signal Corps. He trained briefly as an <b>aerial</b> observer and <b>photo</b> <b>interpreter</b> before being reassigned to the Chemical Warfare Service, where he did research under Richard C. Tolman. He was discharged at war's end in 1919 as a sergeant first class and then returned to Brown once again to teach. Later that year he joined the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.|$|R
40|$|With rapid new {{technological}} development {{during the past}} 50 years, <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> have been increasingly and commonly used not only in geographic information systems but also in various spatially related applications. Many municipalities and government agencies have constructed <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases all over the world. Keeping these databases up to date {{is the most important}} part of making them effective so that <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases are expected to be updated as frequently as possible. However, in practice, some of them are barely updated because of high cost. In case of detecting where changes occur, <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases could be frequently and partially updated only in the changed areas. In this study, medium spatial resolution imagery is proposed to detect changes. Instead of using <b>aerial</b> <b>photos,</b> medium spatial resolution imagery could be a good alternative because of its wider coverage and lower price than <b>aerial</b> <b>photos.</b> Free accessible Landsat ETM+ and orthophotomaps are used for change detection. In order to compare with 15 m pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+, 1 m orthophotomaps are decomposed, segmented, and classified through wavelet transform and object-oriented classification. Although the detected changes are rough, the result shows that the method is quite costeffective and practical. Moreover, it could support decision making for updating <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases. 1.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} investigate the use of volume estimations from aerial photography and probability proportional to size (PPS) sample selection {{in the development of}} a practical sampling design for timber volume estimation on small land areas of Pacific Northwest Douglas -fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii, Franco). The major problem of measuring exact stand height to predict stand volume from <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> was overcome by the development of two new volume equations which use percent crown closure, visible crown diameter and height classes as the independent variables. By the use of height classes, the <b>photo</b> <b>interpreter</b> is required to separate stand heights as to tall, medium or short. Equations are presented for both board- and cubic-foot volumes. Two computer programs were developed which reduce office calculations to a minimum. The programs compute photo volumes per plot, total gross and net volume estimations per area, standard errors and select the field plots to be sampled. The sampling design was tested on four test areas, using both quarter- and one-acre photo plots, and quarter-acre fixed-area and variable-area field plots at four photo scales. Based on these results a sample of about 20 field measured quarter-acre field plots combined with a 100 percent photo cruise on 1 : 7, 000 <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> would be expected to produce gross volume estimations for a forty-acre tract of + 10 percent. at a 68 percent confidence level...|$|R

These mosaics of <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> should be able to be produced with relatively low cost and within the 24 hours of acquisition constraint. The autonomous UAV will be equipped with payload management system specifically developed for rapid aerial mapping. As mentioned before turn around time is the key factor, so accuracy is not the main focus (not orthorectified aerial mapping).

There was no difference, the CIA's chief <b>photo</b> <b>interpreter</b> told them, in the intelligence that could be derived from photographs with 10-foot resolution than those with 5-foot resolution. The Purcell group concluded that development of a new search system, with resolution between 4 and 6 feet was not justified.|$|R

40|$|The {{usage of}} modern {{appliances}} {{in science and}} technology has enabled us to easily obtain three dimensional (3 D) information of target location. However, there is a limitation because past information cannot be retrieved using existing technology. For example, a two dimensional (2 D) historical information can be a negative <b>aerial</b> <b>photo,</b> printed <b>aerial</b> <b>photo,</b> map and et cetera. The historical data are used in agricultural mapping, forestry and town planning. A greyscale <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> represents information in 2 D using x and y values. This research is focussed on height information extraction using image processing technique. In this study, the relationship between pixel and voxel is used to solve high information extraction problem from old <b>aerial</b> <b>photo.</b> Based on Gudes idea, the pixel intensity value of a pixel is related directly to the value of the z-coordinate. Simultaneously, the test on a pixel profile line to obtain the greyscale is implemented. A result of the test is compared using Bersoft Image Measurement, efglabs and Image-Pro Plus. 3 Dfield software is used to re-plot the height information extracted from the <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> images. Comparisons between the original and re-plotting images have shown insignificant differences. Consequently, it is proven that the proposed technique presented in this report is feasible as a tool for height information extraction from an <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> image...|$|R
