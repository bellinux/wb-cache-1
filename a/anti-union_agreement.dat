25|$|Representatives of the Cloud City Miners' Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the Western Federation of Miners, {{asked for}} a wage {{increase}} of fifty cents per day for all mine workers not already making three dollars per day. The union felt justified, for fifty cents a day had been cut from the miners' wages during the depression of 1893. Negotiations broke down and 968 miners walked out. Mine owners, who had formed a Mine Owners' Association with a secret <b>anti-union</b> <b>agreement,</b> locked out another 1,332 mine workers.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} Adair v. United States, the United States Supreme Courts {{majority}} {{held that the}} provision of the Erdman Act relating to discharge, because it would compel an employer to accept or retain the personal services of another person against the employers will, {{was a violation of}} the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that no person shall be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law. The court was careful, however, to restrict the decision to the provision relating to discharge, and to express no opinion as to the remainder of the law. The section of the Erdman Act making it criminal to force employees to sign <b>anti-union</b> <b>agreements</b> therefore remained unadjudicated.|$|R
