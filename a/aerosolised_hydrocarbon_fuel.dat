No data of tested-cooling-ability of endothermic fuels have been broadly discussed in literature. In this work a high-temperature flow calo-rimeter was designed, and the cooling capacity of six different <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> were measured. Experimental {{results showed that}} these <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> have capacity for cooling high-temperature structures, and that the cooling capacity of fuel N- 1 can reach 3. 15 MJ/kg, which can nearly satisfy the requirement of thermal management for a Mach 3 cruise aircraft, whose heat sink re-quirement is about 3. 5 MJ/kg.

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{fibre optic}} sensor {{for the detection}} and location of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel</b> spills is presented. The sensor is designed such that liquid swelling polymers transduce their swelling into a microbend force on an optical fibre when exposed to <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels.</b> Interrogation of the sensor using standard Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) techniques provides the possibility of rapidly detecting and locating target <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> and chemicals at multiple positions along the sensor length. Events can typically be located to a precision of 2 m over a 10 km sensor length. Sensor response time on exposure to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel</b> is within 30 seconds. A detailed explanation of the operational characteristics of the sensor and the underlying technology utilised in its operation is given. Experimental tests using prototype sensors to simultaneously detect three separate 50 centimetre-long events are described. The characteristics of the sensor response {{in a range of}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> under varying environmental conditions were investigated. Some of the safety advantages in using the sensor and its practical implementation in continuous monitoring of pipelines or fuel containment vessels are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a predictive chemical-kinetic model to describe the combustion of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> {{is one of the}} most important research areas in combustion. The key to understanding and modeling the combustion of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> is to obtain an accurate chemical-kinetic model for the oxidation of C 1 and C 2 hydrocarbons.

40|$|New fuels with high-energy-density are {{desirable}} for many combustion applications. Two types are reviewed in this paper, namely, mixtures resulting from addition of certain metallic or nonmetallic elements to conventional <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels,</b> and newly synthesized <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> with strained molecular conformations or more densely packed molecular structures. Despite the favorable effects of high-energy content, these materials often exhibit low reactivity {{and their ability}} to improve the performance of practical combustion systems relies strongly on their interaction with the dynamics of the surrounding fluid flow. The intensity of the combustion processes of these materials is dictated, in general, by the melting, evaporation, pyrolysis, mixing, and exothermic reactions processes. Unlike other conventional <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels,</b> all these processes time scales are often comparable with each other, causing difficulties to devise simpler theoretical models to predict the combustion characteristics. Both the advances made in recent years and the needs for future research and development in the field of energetic fuels are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of {{this mode of}} combustion is to add a percentage of hydrogen gas to the combustion reactions of either compression or spark ignition engines. The addition of hydrogen {{has been shown to}} decrease the formation of NOx, CO and unburned hydrocarbons. Studies have shown that added hydrogen in percentages as low as 5 - 10 % percent of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel</b> can reduce that <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption. The theory behind this concept is that the addition of hydrogen can extend the lean operation limit, improve the lean burn ability, and decrease burn duration. To apply this method to an engine a source of hydrogen is needed. At this time the simplest option would be to carry a tank of hydrogen. Research is being conducted to allow the hydrogen to be reformed from the vehicles <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel</b> supply or produce hydrogen from electrolysis of water.
