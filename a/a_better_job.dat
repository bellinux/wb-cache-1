5|$|Bottomley soon {{gave up his}} apprenticeship, {{and after}} a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here he picked up a working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E

Mac then tells Caroline that he felt three things when she had accused his then girlfriend: he was impressed and amused, but instead of saying the third thing he kisses her.|$|E
2500|$|The biosynthetic {{pathway to}} {{paclitaxel}} {{has been investigated}} and consists of approximately 20 enzymatic steps. The complete scheme is still unavailable. The segments that are known {{are very different from}} the synthetic pathways tried thus far (Scheme 1). The starting compound is geranylgeranyl diphosphate 2 [...] which is a dimer of geraniol 1. [...] This compound already contains all the required 20 carbon atoms for the paclitaxel skeleton. More ring closing through intermediate 3 (taxadiene) leads to taxusin 4. The two main reasons why this type of synthesis is not feasible in the laboratory is that nature does <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>job</b> controlling stereochemistry and <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> <b>job</b> activating <b>a</b> hydrocarbon skeleton with oxygen substituents for which cytochrome P450 is responsible in some of the oxygenations.

5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded do <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of directing this city than the city council of D.C.

5|$|When Oliver {{arrived in}} Adelaide he started playing for West Suburbans and {{immediately}} began to draw attention from the two largest South Australian Football League (SAFL) clubs, Norwood and Port Adelaide. South Australian businessman Edwin T. Smith was sending Oliver letters asking him to come train with Norwood whilst John Woolard, then captain of Port Adelaide who like Oliver grew up in Broken Hill, was also enquiring about his services. Before Oliver made his debut with Port Adelaide he was lined up with a job shovelling furnace waste. Disgruntled, {{he spoke to the}} Musgrave brothers father who suggested he approach West Torrens and train with them, to which Oliver agreed. Port Adelaide secretary James Hodge prevented this move as Oliver had signed a contract with him shortly beforehand. Hodge later took Oliver out on a fishing trip to resolve the feud and found him <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, hoping that he would get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E

As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.|$|E
