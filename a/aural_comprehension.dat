5000|$|Although speech {{perception}} {{is considered to}} be an auditory skill, it is intrinsically multimodal, since producing speech requires the speaker to make movements of the lips, teeth and tongue which are often visible in face-to-face communication. Information from the lips and face supports <b>aural</b> <b>comprehension</b> [...] and most fluent listeners of a language are sensitive to seen speech actions (see McGurk effect). The extent to which people make use of seen speech actions varies with the visibility of the speech action and the knowledge and skill of the perceiver.|$|E

This study is an attempt to explore the basic constructs of <b>aural</b> pragmatic <b>comprehension</b> in second language (L 2) learning. Taking pragmatic comprehension as the recognition of speech acts and conversational implicatures, this study compares pragmatic comprehension levels and the performances in oral and written production using a hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicate a significant relationship between writing performance and pragmatic comprehension (p< 0. 01) and a positive relationship, though not statistically significant, between oral performance and <b>aural</b> pragmatic <b>comprehension,</b> all of which propose an intimate link between linguistic production and pragmatic gain.

30|$|Investigations {{carried out}} {{on the impact of}} {{simplification}} compared to elaboration on <b>aural</b> input <b>comprehension</b> and retention has indicated that elaboration devices make the contribution to the improved comprehension more than linguistically simplified input (Chaudron 1983).

As a result, ELLs may find these texts semantically and syntactically complex (Khang 2008). According to Brewer (2008), given that written input should not be negotiated on the spot like oral input can, it is necessary that the negotiation of meaning of the material occur before by modification.|$|R

An examination of the teaching of <b>aural</b> <b>comprehension</b> skills in the VCE music classroom also forms part of this research. The researcher has had an abiding interest in this area since beginning his career, which has been concurrent with the introduction and development of the VCE. The impact of this curriculum reform on the critical area of <b>aural</b> <b>comprehension</b> has been dramatic and for this reason this research examines the area of <b>aural</b> <b>comprehension</b> from the perspective of what is asked of the students and how teachers currently address this area in the classroom.

The study is part of a seven-country project investigating early language learning in Europe.

Individual differences in <b>aural</b> <b>comprehension</b> anticipated by several years changes in rank on the general factor as defined by standard tests.

40|$|Understanding second {{language}} acquisition (SLA) {{has been a}} topic of study for many years. Second language reading has been studied from many different perspectives such as the importance of first language transfer in learning to read in a Second Language, mental translation as a {{second language}} reading strategy, social influence of Second Language reading development, and understanding the limited knowledge of second language readers in relation to cultural and contextual factors. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate second language text comprehension from the perspective of language processing within the field of cognitive science, especially with reference to attention resources. The role of attention in second language acquisition with regard to the notion of detection is a crucial aspect of Second Language <b>aural</b> and written <b>comprehension.</b> As a function of attention, detection selects specific elements found in the input to be registered in working memory where they are subject to further processing by the Second language learner. During attention, more specifically detection, posits that form and meaning, which are not independent of one another, compete for the limited cognitive resources available to the adult Second language learner, especially, in the early stages of second language acquisition. Consequently, in these early stages, the demand of comprehending a message deplete the attention system making it more difficult for Second language learner to process for linguistic form and content or meaning at the same time. The overall purpose of this thesis is to determine the effect of attention to form versus attention to meaning while processing input for meaning during the advanced stage of second language acquisition.
