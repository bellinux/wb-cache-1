5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism <b>and</b> <b>trauma.</b> The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery <b>and</b> <b>trauma,</b> {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, <b>and</b> <b>trauma</b> to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E

40|$|A {{random sample}} of 247 Canadian single mothers {{currently}} receiving social assistance participated in a study designed to: a) provide a comprehensive description of mother’s lifetime exposure to 11 adversities, four psychological <b>traumas,</b> <b>and</b> eight assaultive traumas; b) examine the association between exposure to childhood and adulthood adversities <b>and</b> <b>traumas,</b> <b>and</b> mother’s current post-traumatic stress symptom. Of those surveyed, 31 % met the criteria for a probable PTSD diagnosis. Between 78 % and 80 % reported 1 or more lifetime adversity, psychological <b>trauma,</b> <b>and</b> assaultive <b>trauma.</b> Rates of adversities were similar to the general female population. However, rates of psychological <b>and</b> assaultive <b>trauma</b> were six to ten {{times greater than the}} general female population. Results show that level of exposure to psychological <b>and</b> assaultive <b>traumas,</b> but not adversity, differentially impacted both the patterning and severity of mothers’ current PTSD symptoms. Psychological trauma exposure was the only event type that differentiated the mean scores for the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyper-arousal symptom clusters. While exposure to assaultive trauma differentiates mean scores primarily for the avoidance/numbing symptoms cluster.

40|$|To {{know the}} {{prevalence}} and etiology of oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>trauma</b> in elders. Analytical quantitative cross-sectional study conducted {{at a public}} trauma hospital located in Fortaleza-Ceará, Brazil. The study population comprised patients with trauma who were hospitalized from April to August 2014. Of these patients, patients with oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>trauma</b> were chosen {{to be included in}} the research. A questionnaire was administered in order to obtain information on socio-demographics, systemic comorbidities, use of medication, deleterious habits (smoking and alcohol consumption), etiology of oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>trauma</b> <b>and</b> type of pre-hospital care. Of the 280 elderly hospitalized with trauma, 47 had oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>trauma,</b> with a prevalence of 16. 8 %. In this group, the age ranged from 60 to 88 years, with a mean age of 72. 4 years (SD± 8. 38). The elderly were mostly women (55. 3 %), self-declared pardos (53. 2 %), who presented with cardiovascular disorders (48. 9 %), and who received formal pre-hospital care (70. 2 %). Elderly who were in the 60 - 69 years age group, spent 6 - 9 years at school and drank alcohol were 2. 64, 3. 75, and 1. 97, respectively, more likely to suffer oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>trauma.</b> The main causes of trauma were physical aggression, traffic accidents, falls and domestic accidents. All of the physical aggressions resulted in oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>traumas,</b> <b>and</b> the elderly who suffered traffic accidents were four times more likely to have oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>trauma.</b> The prevalence of 16. 8 % and the lack of research on oral <b>and</b> maxillofacial <b>traumas</b> in the elderly is worrisome and should be included in the oral health indicators for the elderly population to support the importance of oral health...|$|R

Rates of physical, sexual, <b>and</b> emotional <b>trauma</b> were higher in childhood than adulthood and ranged from 44. 7 % (physical trauma in childhood) to 4. 5 % (sexual trauma in adulthood).
