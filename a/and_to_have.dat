In such proceedings, {{the fact that for}} seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|Apocryphal and semi-legendary anecdotal stories {{surround}} {{the creation of}} Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels. For example, he {{is known to have}} dyed his hair <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> worn a variety of national costumes. In the autumn of 1871, Levski and Angel Kanchev published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People, a BRCC draft statute containing ideological, organisational and penal sections. It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community for discussion. The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.|$|E

5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E

Feminists have also worked to promote bodily autonomy and integrity, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{successful}} operations off North Africa, Massachusetts {{was taken}} in for an overhaul in the Boston Navy Yard. After the refitting, the ship sailed for the Pacific theater, and arrived in Nouméa on 4 March. The battleship supported operations in the South Pacific over the next months, including guarding convoy lanes, escorting aircraft carriers, and bombarding Japanese positions on various islands, including Nauru (8 December 1943) and Kwajalein (30 January 1944). Returning to carrier protection after the latter bombardment, Massachusetts provided anti-aircraft defense while Allied air attacks were sent against Saipan, Tinian and Guam; she also supported later invasions of the Caroline Islands and Hollandia. After bombarding Ponape Island on 1 May, the ship set course for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her gun barrels relined, as they had worn out.|$|E

5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E

5|$|In 335BC Alexander {{felt free}} to engage the Thracians and the Illyrians, but, while he was campaigning in the north, Demosthenes spread a rumour—even {{producing}} a bloodstained messenger—that Alexander {{and all of his}} expeditionary force had been slaughtered by the Triballians.* J. R. Hamilton, Alexander the Great, 48. The Thebans and the Athenians rebelled once again, financed by Darius III of Persia, and Demosthenes is said to have received about 300talents on behalf of Athens <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> faced accusations of embezzlement. Alexander reacted immediately and razed Thebes to the ground. He did not attack Athens, but demanded the exile of all anti-Macedonian politicians, Demosthenes first of all.
