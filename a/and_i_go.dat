500|$|With {{his recent}} solo work, he has cited {{electronic}} music—in which the guitar is often completely absent—as an influence. His electronic music influences include Aphex Twin, Depeche Mode, New Order, The Human League, Ekkehard Ehlers, Peter Rehberg, and Christian Fennesz. His interests are constantly changing, as {{he believes that}} without change he will no longer {{have any interest in}} playing: [...] "I'm always drawing inspiration from different kinds of music and playing guitar along with records, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into each new album project with a preconceived idea of what styles I want to combine." ...|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with your views as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> no further".|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra, [...] "then they would go off with Alan and David in a more intimate recording environment and perfect their vocals". However, more trouble arose as Madonna was not comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled.|$|E

That belting did not move. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> “Wow, what if I used that belting and Velcro on the side over here?” <b>And</b> <b>I</b> stood there on third base for about that long. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> “That’s a good idea.” ...|$|R

And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E

And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's {{pedigree}} includes horses {{adept at}} classic race distances on his sire's side and endowed with speed on his dam's side. Sire [...] the Nile won the Santa Anita Derby and ran {{second in the}} 2009 Kentucky Derby, {{with all of his}} wins at distances of [...] miles or more. Prior to American Pharoah, Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion. Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with [...] "a big, long stride" [...] and had [...] "that same springing motion as American Pharoah, whose acceleration is pretty remarkable." [...] He also praised Pioneerof the Nile's dam, Star of Goshen: [...] "She was a freaky filly, really, really fast." [...] To Baffert, American Pharoah's bloodline is a source of fascination: [...] "Every time I work him, I {{go back and look at}} the pedigree, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> What is going on here?" ...|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't [...] To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording.|$|E
500|$|According to the film's music {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra before working with Parker and music supervisor David Caddick [...] "in a more intimate recording environment [...] perfect their vocals". More trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with [...] "laying down a guide vocal simultaneously with an 84-piece orchestra" [...] in the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not having musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no creative control. [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment," [...] she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna, where {{it was decided that}} the singer would record her part at Whitfield Street Studios, a contemporary studio, while the orchestration would take place elsewhere. She also had alternate days off from the recording to preserve and strengthen her voice.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So I go down to Australia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share it with you because it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want to share that side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place and I kind of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody those kinds of things that go on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
