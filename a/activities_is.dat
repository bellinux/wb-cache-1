5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, drilling, {{and other human}} <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> a {{significant}} concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E

The finding of this research showed that were found about 20 topics of grammar in Look Ahead 1 published by Erlangga, they were noun phrase (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of filling in the blank), pronoun (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of taking turning asking question, completing the text and circling the word), simple past tense (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of asking question and filling in the blank), time conjunctions (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving sample and completing the functional text, an e-mail), punctuation (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of indicating the sentences), appositive (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of boxing the material, and supplying), direct and indirect speech (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of explanation in the table, chancing the sentences and rewriting the sentences), relative pronoun (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of filling in the blank), thinking verbs, feeling verbs and verbs of senses (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving explanation in the table, and finding in the blank), adverb of manner, place, and time (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of giving explanation), action verbs (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> the form of translating the words), connectors (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of completing the paragraph and giving more examples), imperatives (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of giving the information), linking verbs (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> the form of giving information and changing the sentences), qualitative adjectives (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of finding the antonym), order of adjectives (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving information and completing the sentences), relating verbs (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of giving explanation), degree of comparison (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving explanation and comparing picture), passive voice and manner in passive (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving explanation, changing the words and the sentences). ...|$|R
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E
5|$|Management in all {{business}} and organizational <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource management, operations management (or production management), strategic management, marketing management, financial management, and information technology management, which was responsible for management information systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches marketing management, operations management, and strategic management.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E

5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E
5|$|The area rapidly {{changed from}} European American to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the {{population}} was only 7.8% white. By 1960, {{the population was}} 0.5% white. From 1950 to 2000 {{the total population of}} the neighborhood declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline is partly due to initiatives of the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which empowered redevelopment authorities that have acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non-residential uses. A good example of the Land Clearing commission <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.|$|E

5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
