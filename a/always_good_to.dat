500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the FA Cup for the seventh time, the club's manager Rafael Benítez stated that neither side {{deserved}} to lose the match: [...] "It was difficult to say we deserved to win or the other team. It was a magnificent final. We knew that they could score goals but that we could also. We needed to keep going but after 63 games it was really difficult." [...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, they gave us a really good game {{but we had a}} never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties as we did not have any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have a player like Steven Gerrard in your team." [...] A BBC Sport poll in May 2015 deemed Gerrard's goal to be the best in an FA Cup Final from the past 50 years.|$|E

Nelly also earned nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for the album Nellyville as well as Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for the song [...] "Dilemma" [...] (featuring Kelly Rowland), for a total five. Regarding his nominations, Nelly commented: [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be nominated, especially for something {{as big as the}} Grammys. Just the recognition itself is an award. But you want that little gold record player. You just want to take it home." [...] The award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was presented to Nelly at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though not broadcast on television.

In addition, Nelly received the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} began as soon as Madonna had signed up for it. Griffin Dunne was signed to play the part of Loudon Trott, a lawyer whose job was to help Nikki get on a bus, after she was released. Initially Madonna had thought of asking Penn to play the part of Detective Bellson, but Penn was serving a 60-day jail term, having {{violated}} the probation he received in 1986, for assaulting a friend of Madonna and attacking an extra {{on the set of}} At Close Range. The part went to Robert Swan, followed by the signing of John McMartin, Haviland Morris and Bibi Besch as Trott's father-in-law, fiancée, and mother-in-law [...] respectively. Madonna herself commented that she had a lot in common with the character Nikki. [...] "She's courageous and sweet and funny and misunderstood. But she clears her name in the last, and that's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> do. I'm continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki's tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." [...] Madonna was also offered the lead role in the Blake Edwards comedy film Blind Date opposite to Bruce Willis, but she refused it in favor of Slammer. She said, [...] "The thing I had planned to do after Shanghai Surprise was Blind Date at Tri-Star. I was supposed to have the approval of the director and the leading man, but they didn't tell me they'd already hired Bruce Willis. That... just didn't work out. But I was really excited about doing a real physical, screwball comedy, so when Jamie brought this up, it was like my reward." [...] Coati Mundi, member of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Madonna's long-time friend joined the cast {{to play the role of}} Raoul, Nikki's enemy. Costume designer Deborah Scott was signed to create the wardrobe {{for the film}}. Madonna, who visualized the character of Nikki as a dizzy screwball blond, started watching the screwball comedies of the sixties, especially the work of actors like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and Judy Holiday. She asked Scott to create comical rah-rah and ballet tutu skirts for the character, with fishnet tights and loud make-up. Scott also designed a glamorous Monroe-esque dress for the love scene between her and Dunne.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 April 2012, Terry {{was sent}} off for violent conduct after driving a knee into Barcelona's Alexis Sánchez in an off-the-ball {{incident}} in the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League semi-final at the Camp Nou. Chelsea's 3–2 aggregate victory over the holders qualified them for the final against Bayern Munich, for which Terry would be suspended. Terry later apologised for letting his teammates and Chelsea fans down. Terry scored his sixth league goal of the season, seventh in all competitions, in the final match of the season, a 2–1 victory over already-relegated Blackburn. The goal meant that it was Terry's most prolific season and he told the Chelsea website, [...] "I am delighted with seven... It's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> end a league season with a win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Wong {{admits to}} being controlling, and oversees every aspect the filmmaking process, he has formed several {{long-lasting}} partnerships and close collaborators. In 2013 he said, [...] "It is <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> work with a very regular group of people because we know how high we can fly {{and what are the}} parameters, and it becomes very enjoyable." [...] Two men have been instrumental in developing and achieving his aesthetic: production designer William Chang and cinematographer Christopher Doyle. Chang has worked on every Wong film and is a trusted confidant, responsible for all set design and costuming. Doyle photographed seven of his projects, all from Days of Being Wild to 2046. Stephen Schneider writes that he deserves [...] "much credit" [...] in Wong's success, as his [...] "masterful use of light and colour renders every frame a work of art". Wong's other regular colleagues include writer-producer Jeffrey Lau, producer Jacky Pang, and assistant director Johnnie Kong.|$|E

2500|$|George H. W. Bush {{employed}} the word [...] "liberal" [...] as a derogatory epithet during his 1988 presidential campaign. Bush {{described himself as}} a patriot, and described his liberal opponents as unpatriotic. He referred to liberalism as [...] "the L-word" [...] and sought to demonize opposing presidential candidate Michael Dukakis by labeling Dukakis [...] "the liberal governor" [...] and by pigeonholing him as part of what Bush called [...] "the L-crowd". Bush recognized that motivating voters to fear Dukakis as a risky, non-mainstream candidate generated political support for his own campaign. Bush's campaign also used issues of prayer to arouse suspicions that Dukakis was less devout in his religious convictions. Bush's running mate, vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle said to Christians at the 1988 Republican National Convention [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be with people who are real Americans". Bill Clinton avoided association with [...] "liberal" [...] as a political label during his 1992 presidential campaign against George H.W. Bush by moving closer to the political center.|$|E
2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time as she looked too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part for you on a show {{you really want to be}} on. It was a complete surprise and totally out of the blue." [...] The character was originally planned to appear nicer but end up being [...] "badder" [...] than Brooke. Blampied started filming her scenes in October 2011. Blampied found her first day of work similar to walking [...] "into a beast" [...] and although she was nervous, she found it was like [...] "a family". In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off at the end of her stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit. One of the writers said to me on my last day, 'Well it's <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have a crazy in the cupboard.'" [...] Bree made her last appearance on 25 September 2012.|$|E
