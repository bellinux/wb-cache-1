5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a hardship than it was <b>at</b> <b>many</b> of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not as intense as <b>at</b> <b>many</b> front-line fort.|$|E

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied <b>at</b> <b>many</b> scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} of the Toraja is a bamboo flute called a Pa'suling (suling is an Indonesian word for flute). This six-holed flute (not unique to the Toraja) is played <b>at</b> <b>many</b> dances, such as the thanksgiving dance Ma'bondensan, where the flute accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the Pa'pelle (made from palm leaves) and the Pa'karombi (the Torajan version of a jaw harp). The Pa'pelle is played during harvest time and at house inauguration ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{restaurants}} and eateries offering food from cultures all over the world, especially Mediterranean and Asian, but also international gourmet cuisine, traditional Danish food and New Nordic Cuisine. Among the oldest restaurants are Rådhuscafeen (lit. The City Hall Café), opened in 1924, serving a menu of traditional Danish meals, and Peter Gift from 1906, a tavern with a broad beer selection and a menu of smørrebrød and other Danish dishes. In Aarhus, New Nordic can be experienced at Kähler Villa Dining, Hærværk and Domestic, but local produce can be had <b>at</b> <b>many</b> places, especially at the twice-weekly food markets in Frederiksbjerg. Arhus and the Central Denmark Region was selected as European Region of Gastronomy in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, {{sleight of hand}} is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit <b>at</b> <b>many</b> gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} bred {{for use on}} farms, {{few members}} of the breed are used for agricultural purposes today, and are now mostly bred for horse shows and working in urban areas. However, the Carlsberg brewery has used the Jutland to pull its drays since 1928. The brewery owned 210Jutlands at their peak, and today still uses about 20 for transporting beer around Copenhagen. The Carlsberg horses also compete and put on demonstrations <b>at</b> <b>many</b> shows, promoting the brewery and the breed.|$|E
5|$|As {{a public}} university, McGill {{is not as}} {{dependent}} on its endowment for operating revenue as some of its international peers. The McGill endowment only provides approximately 10 per cent of the school's annual operating revenues. Nonetheless, McGill's endowment rests within the top 10 percent of all North American post-secondary institutions' endowments. While McGill's conservative investment policy has protected it from the more substantial losses experienced <b>at</b> <b>many</b> other universities during the market crisis of 2008–2009, it still faced a 20% endowment decline from approximately $920 million to $740 million. Currently valued at $39,323 per student, the university's endowment is the second largest among Canadian universities on a per-student basis.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>many</b> of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never {{given a chance to}} show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted {{people to think about}} the future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance <b>at</b> <b>many</b> of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E
