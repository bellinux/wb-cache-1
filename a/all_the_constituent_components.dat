Structural biologists employ a variety of biophysical methods to study large macromolecular complexes, but no single technique is likely to provide a complete description of the structure–function relationship of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components.</b> Since structural studies generally only provide snapshots of these dynamic machines as they accomplish their molecular functions, combining data from many methodologies is crucial {{to our understanding of}} molecular function...|$|E
30|$|The GDT is {{developed}} by Olhede et al. [19] for speech-type signal processing. This method can transform an arbitrary time-varying frequency ridge into a line paralleling {{to the time}} axis, and {{make it possible to}} separate any interested time-frequency ridge into a mono-component from other components by conventional filters. For separating the overlapped multi-components, an improved GDT is proposed in Ref. [20]. In this improved method, a varying window function is used to improve the time–frequency concentration of the generalized short time Fourier transform. Due to the characteristics of the GDT, some researchers applied it or its improved versions to process the nonstationary signals, especially for processing amplitude modulation (AM)—frequency modulation (FM) signal in recent years [21, 22]. A joint envelope and frequency order spectrum analysis method based on iterative GDT is proposed by Feng et al. [23] for diagnosing planetary gearbox under nonstationary conditions, where the iterative GDT can decompose <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> into mono-components of constant frequency.|$|E

This paper analyses {{the evolution of a}} biopower innovation system in Sweden where particular attention is given to current driving forces and obstacles to a large-scale diffusion of biopower. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, this innovation system went through a successful 'formative phase' in which <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> of the 'infant' system emerged. With the introduction of green certificates and emission trading rights, incentives were created that were large enough to shift the system into a 'growth phase', where the extensive district heating system and voluminous production in the paper and pulp industry can be used to produce power on a large scale in CHP plants. An investment boom is now underway and output of biopower is rapidly growing. Yet, there are still substantial obstacles to a realisation of the full potential of biopower. Three of these are outlined and an associated set of policy challenges are specified. ...|$|E
40|$|Islands {{across the}} world have evolved at the {{interface}} between land and sea, thus comprising landscapes and seascapes. Many islands have also been influenced by anthropogenic factors, which {{have given rise to}} mosaics of anthromes (sensu Ellis and Ramankutty). These elements of landscapes, seascapes, and cultural impacts in varied proportions, generate unique environments which merit a unique term: islandscapes. The use of the term islandscape is advocated as the only term which encompasses <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> of an island, in a holistic manner. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the applicability of existing landscape and seascape character assessment methodologies in an island context, and to propose a methodological framework for mapping the space which defines the term ‘islandscape’.

40|$|In {{order to}} protect authors and artists from unremunerative {{transfers}} of copyright, Congress {{for the first time}} created, in the Copyright Act of 1976, an inalienable right to terminate transfers of copyrights during a five-year window beginning 35 years from the date of the transfer. Such inalienablity, however, posed substantial uncertainty to the exploitation of many works of authorship. In particular, works combining multiple copyrighted elements — such as collective works and motion pictures — could become unavailable due to the difficulty of relicensing <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components.</b> For that reason, Congress provided a mechanism for precluding termination of at least some transfers. In the case of a “work made for hire,” the hiring party acquires ownership of the copyright upon a work’s creation, thereby dispensing with any transfer from the author and hence obviating any termination of such transfer 35 years later. To avoid the exception swallowing the rule, Congress circumscribed the situations under which a work qualifies for treatment as a “work made for hire. ” It must either be prepared by a true employee or specially ordered or commissioned and fall within one of nine categories, such as “contribution to a collective work” and “part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work. ” This article examines a potentially significant and heretofore unrecognized conundrum of the 1976 Copyright Act relating to the “contribution to a collective work” category. Congress defined “collective works” as comprised of “preexisting materials. ” Yet the work made for hire provision contemplates “contributions to collective works” being specially ordered or commissioned. How is it possible for a publisher or record label to specially order or commission contributions that already exist? The authors’ journey into the complex evolution of the 1976 Copyright Act reveals that Congress did not intend that “contributions to collective works” preexist their commissioning, even though the inartful drafting of some of the Section 101 definitions suggest otherwise. For purposes of applying the work for hire doctrine, courts should either ignore {{the use of the term}} “preexisting” in the definition of “collective work,” or interpret the term “contribution to collective work” to include “contribution to yet-to-be-assembled collective work” in the definition of “work made for hire. ” The article also elucidates the legislative history underlying the right to terminate transfers, a right which will have justiciable implications beginning in 2003...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to near-infrared spectral (NIR) data analysis that is based on independent component analysis (ICA). The main advantage of the new method is that it is able to separate the spectra of <b>the</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> from <b>the</b> spectra of their mixtures. The separation is a blind operation, since <b>the</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> of mixtures can be unknown. The ICA based method is therefore particularly useful in identifying the unknown components in a mixture as well as in estimating their concentrations. The approach is introduced by reference to case studies and compared to other techniques for NIR analysis including principal component regression (PCR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and partial least squares (PLS) as well as Fourier and wavelet transforms. 1...|$|R
