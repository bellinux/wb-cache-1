50|$|The second pathway is a GPCR-Gq/Gβγ-IP3 pathway {{which is}} used with <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>sweeteners</b> bind and {{activate}} GPCRs coupled to PLCβ2 by either α-Gq or Gβγ. The activated subunits activate PLCβ2 to generate IP3 and DAG. IP3 and DAG elicit Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and cause cellular depolarization.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} sugar substitutes on the gut microbiome. Methods: PUBMED was used to find articles that studied the gut microbiome after consumption of a sugar substitute in humans. Both observational and interventional studies were selected for this review. Results: Starting with 31 articles found on PUBMED, 5 articles were included to be reviewed after 26 articles were excluded. Three natural sugar substitutes and four categories of <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners</b> were studied. Maltitol, lactitol, and isomalt were the natural sugar substitutes, and aspartame, acesulfame-K, non-caloric <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> and saccharin were the <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> The outcomes for Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacilli, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, and Enterobacteriaceae were addressed. Natural sugar substitutes were seen to increase bacterial populations that are believed to be beneficial to humans while <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners</b> established bacterial populations that are considered harmful to health. Conclusions: The studies examined suggest cautious use of <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners</b> due to its effects on the gut microbiome while natural sugar substitutes could have potential health benefit...|$|R

25|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company.

25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a cough {{suppressant}} whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. Sorbitol, an <b>artificial</b> <b>sweetener</b> found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin, an expectorant commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
25|$|Apart from sugar of lead (used as a {{sweetener}} {{in ancient}} through medieval times before the toxicity of lead was known), saccharin {{was the first}} <b>artificial</b> <b>sweetener</b> and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process {{for the creation of}} saccharin from phthalic anhydride was developed in 1950, and, currently, saccharin is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times as sweet as sugar (sucrose) and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods, and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of saccharin is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.|$|E

2500|$|Sucralose is an <b>artificial</b> <b>sweetener</b> {{and sugar}} substitute. The {{majority}} of ingested sucralose is not {{broken down by}} the body, so it is noncaloric.

2500|$|A non-food {{source of}} {{phenylalanine}} is the <b>artificial</b> <b>sweetener</b> aspartame.

The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: [...] "Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine." [...] In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer {{to the presence of}} [...] "aspartame or E951" [...] and they must be labeled with a warning [...] "Contains a source of phenylalanine."

2500|$|The <b>artificial</b> <b>sweetener</b> {{aspartame}} {{has been}} the subject of several controversies since its initial approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1974. The FDA approval of aspartame was highly contested, with critics alleging that the quality of the initial research supporting its safety was inadequate and flawed and that conflicts of interest marred the 1981 approval of aspartame. In 1987, the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that the food additive approval process had been followed properly for aspartame. The irregularities fueled a conspiracy theory, which the [...] "Nancy Markle" [...] email hoax circulated, along with claims, counter to the weight of medical evidence, that numerous health conditions (such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus, methanol toxicity, blindness, spasms, shooting pains, seizures, headaches, depression, anxiety, memory loss, birth defects, and death) are caused by the consumption of aspartame in normal doses.|$|E
2500|$|Aspartame is {{approximately}} 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). Due to this property, even though aspartame produces four kilocalories of energy per gram (/g) when metabolized, {{the quantity of}} aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible. [...] The taste of aspartame and other <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners</b> {{differs from that of}} table sugar in the times of onset and how long the sweetness lasts, though aspartame comes closest to sugar's taste profile among approved <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than that of sucrose, so it is often blended with other <b>artificial</b> <b>sweeteners</b> such as acesulfame potassium to produce an overall taste more like that of sugar.|$|R
