Besides relative and absolute field calibration procedures, there is an absolute laboratory calibration procedure, which is used at the University of Bonn. Since February 2009 a new antenna calibration lab, which is especially concepted for the antenna calibration, is operable. This paper presents some investigations on the accuracy of this calibration procedure. The results are mainly based on GPS height measurements and the comparison with the results from a precise levelling. For this purpose 121 baselines between the 8 pillars of an EDM calibration baseline site with distances between 18 and 1101 meters were analysed. The levelled height differences can be regarded as references, thus it is possible to quantify the absolute GPS-accuracy. Furthermore, the GPS-accuracy is an indicator for the antenna calibration accuracy. The measured height differences are usually smaller than 1 - 2 mm (maximal deviations), when using the L 1 or the L 2 frequency, thereby the standard deviation is 0. 8 mm in both cases. As expected, in case of the ionospheric free linear combination L 0 the standard deviation rises up to 3 mm.

The wide {{availability}} of radio signal strength attenuation information on wireless radios has received considerable attention as a convenient means of deriving positioning information.

To overcome the limitation of low absorptivity and weak luminescence of free lanthanide cations in solution, lanthanide complexes are formed with chromophoric groups that are capable of absorbing incident light, and transferring the resulting energy to the lanthanide cation thus sensitizing luminescence ("antenna effect"). Additionally, lanthanide cations must be protected from solvent molecules whose vibrational overtones efficiently deactivate lanthanide cation excited states through non-radiative routes. The research work presented here has focused on developing lanthanide species with improved photophysical properties, utilizing a variety of approaches to reach two main goals: providing efficient sensitization of lanthanide cations via the <b>antennae</b> <b>effect</b> and superior protection against non-radiative deactivation. In a relatively traditional coordination chemistry approach, natural product molecules of the flavonoid family were used as antennae for NIR emitting lanthanide cations. Using a nanomaterials approach to achieve improved protection from quenching, visible emitting lanthanide cations were incorporated into CdSe semiconductor crystals, which bring their own electronic properties, including broad absorbance bands with high epsilon values and size dependent band gaps. Thus, the nanocrystals are used to provide protection from quenching as well as sensitize lanthanide cations through the <b>antennae</b> <b>effect.</b> In an alternate nanomaterials approach NIR emitting Yb 3 + and Nd 3 + were incorporated into NaYF 4 inorganic nanoparticle matrices that were coated with organic tropolonate sensitizing groups.
