5|$|As <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of a {{globular}} cluster are at {{approximately the same}} distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the {{globular cluster}} will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E

25|$|As one travels {{south of}} the Equator, the {{opposite}} happens. The south celestial pole appears increasingly high in the sky, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> lying within an increasingly large circle centered on that pole become circumpolar about it. This continues until one reaches the Earth's South Pole where, once again, all visible stars are circumpolar.|$|E

25|$|Kinematic {{studies have}} shown that Denebola is part of a stellar {{association}} dubbed the IC 2391 supercluster. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of this group share a roughly common motion through space, although they are not gravitationally bound. This suggests that they were born in the same location, and perhaps initially formed an open cluster. Other stars in this association include Alpha Pictoris, Beta Canis Minoris and the open cluster IC 2391. In total more than sixty probable members of the group have been identified.|$|E

25|$|To {{determine}} the number of stars in the Milky Way, volumes in cubic kiloparsecs (kpc3) are selected in various directions. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> in these volumes are counted and the total number of stars statistically determined. The number of globular clusters, dust clouds, and interstellar gas is determined in a similar fashion. To {{determine the}} number of galaxies in superclusters, volumes in cubic megaparsecs (Mpc3) are selected. All the galaxies in these volumes are classified and tallied. The total number of galaxies can then be determined statistically. The huge Boötes void is measured in cubic megaparsecs.|$|E

25|$|It was {{identified}} in Greek mythology with the Argo, the ship used by Jason and the Argonauts that sailed to Colchis {{in search of}} the Golden Fleece. The original constellation is presently found near the southern horizon of the Mediterranean sky, becoming visible in springtime and sailed westward, skimming along the southern horizon. Due to precession of the equinoxes, many of the stars of Argo have been shifted farther south since Classical times, and far fewer of its stars are visible today from the latitudes of the Mediterranean. This includes its brightest 1st-magnitude star, Canopus or α Carinae. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of Argo Navis are easily visible south of the equator, and pass near zenith from southern temperate latitudes.|$|E
25|$|But Jennings' {{principal}} {{role was}} as a tidy, dependable bowler, mainly in one-day cricket. His figures scarcely show many highlights, but his record of being consistently selected alongside stars such as Ian Botham, Joel Garner and Viv Richards indicates a value not measured in wickets. In 1978, he took 40 first-class wickets, the most he achieved in a season, and was awarded his county cap. The bowling included a return of five for 18 in 23.5 overs in the match against Sussex at Hove. That was his only five-wicket haul in senior cricket. Yet with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> available he was picked for both the crucial matches {{at the end of}} the season when it seemed that Somerset might at last win a trophy: in the event, the county lost both the Gillette Cup final to Sussex and the final John Player League match to Essex and missed out on both trophies.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, British comedian Justin Lee Collins went {{searching for}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of Dallas {{to bring them}} {{together}} for a special reunion party. The show was broadcast at 9 p.m. Sunday, May 27, 2007, on UK television network Channel 4 {{as part of the}} Bring Back... series. After hunting down most of the main cast by any means necessary (e.g., climbing over security fences and ambushing hotels), Collins interviewed them and gained more knowledge about some of the decisions made throughout the show's seasons. The participants amongst the cast were Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy, Ken Kercheval, Charlene Tilton, Susan Howard and Mary Crosby. He held his own Oil Baron's Ball, where none of the main cast turned up. However, the actor who played baby Christopher (Eric Farlow) attended. Charlene Tilton spoke in an interview in 2011 about the program, which she said was one of her and the cast's worst experiences ever.|$|E

The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his eagerness to see his rose again, who he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if {{it looks as though}} he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.|$|E
25|$|Although all-electronic {{color was}} {{introduced}} in the U.S. in 1953, high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on January 1, 1954, but over the next dozen years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. In 1956 NBC's The Perry Como Show became the first live network television series to present a majority of episodes in color. CBS's The Big Record, starring pop vocalist Patti Page, was the first television show broadcast in color for the entire 1957-1958 season; its production costs were greater than most movies were at the time not only because of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> featured on the hour-long extravaganza but the extremely high-intensity lighting and electronics required for the new RCA TK-41 cameras. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, {{due in part to the}} color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.|$|E

500|$|The Milky Way is {{the galaxy}} that {{contains}} our Solar System.

The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin , from the Greek [...] ( [...] , [...] "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.
