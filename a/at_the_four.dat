5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> {{corners of}} the wall sit towers (E) with {{intricate}} roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, {{and it was only}} rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.|$|E
5|$|The façade, though {{built in}} the style of the Taj Mahal, lacks {{symmetry}} as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{improving}} road {{access to the}} Fort Dix Military Reservation {{at the onset of}} World War II, a Works Progress Administration project improved the paved road connecting the fort to Bordentown. In 1941, this road was legislated as Route S39, a state highway spur of Route 39 (now US206) that was to run from the fort to Mansfield Square. Construction on the access road was completed in 1943 at a cost of over $2 million. Route S39 became Route 68 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The same year, an extension of Route 68 was legislated to run south from Fort Dix to the intersection with Route 70 and Route 72 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> Mile Circle. In 1961, a freeway was proposed along the Route 68 corridor, running from a planned Route 38 freeway near Fort Dix south to Route 70 and Route 72; however, this was never built.|$|E

5|$|Between 1853 and 1870, the Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first {{director}} of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> {{points of the}} compass around the city, {{as well as many}} smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters. Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc André Citroën (1992), and Parc de Bercy (1997). One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the Left Bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay, has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E

5|$|Nallur, {{the capital}} was built with four entrances with gates. There were two main roadways and four temples <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> gateways.

The {{center of the city}} was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and was surrounded by a square fortification around it. There were courtly buildings for the Kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers and other service providers. The old Nallur Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls.

5|$|Route 72 begins <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> Mile Circle {{intersection}} with Route 70, CR 644, and CR 646 in Woodland Township, Burlington County, {{heading to}} the southeast on Barnegat Road, a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through heavily wooded areas of the Pine Barrens that {{are a part of}} the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest. The road passes near a state hospital before coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 563. Past CR 563, the route continues through the Pine Barrens, passing under an abandoned railroad line prior to a junction with CR 532. Here, Route 72 forms a concurrency with CR 532 and the road enters Barnegat Township in Ocean County, where it comes to a crossroads with CR 539. From this intersection, Route 72 and CR 532 continue to a junction with CR 610, where CR 532 splits from the route by {{heading to the}} east. A short distance later, the route intersects the western terminus of CR 554, which continues along Barnegat Road, and Route 72 turns to the south-southeast through more wooded areas.|$|E

5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, medlars, crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> corners of the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease {{in the early seventies}} and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, McLeod joined the Canadian {{national}} team as they took part in an extended residency in order to prepare and train. McLeod and the Canadian national team started off the year <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> Nations Tournament. While McLeod was on the roster for the tournament, she did not play in any of the three games, allowing fellow Canadian Stephanie Labbé to gain experience. McLeod made her first appearance of the year at the Cyprus Cup in March, where she appeared in three of the four matches that Canada played, recording three shutouts. She also appeared in two other friendlies against France and England in April and May. In April 2015, McLeod was named to the 23-player Canadian roster for the FIFA Women's World Cup hosted by Canada. As Canada's veteran goalkeeper, she started in net for all five of the team's matches, recording three shutouts, and helping Canada earn a sixth-place finish. The team's one loss came in the quarter-finals against England, which halted their advancement in the tournament. Although McLeod had an impressive tournament, she was left off both the Golden Glove shortlist and the FIFA Technical Study Group All-Star Squad.|$|E
