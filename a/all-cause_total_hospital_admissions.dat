30|$|A notable {{advantage}} {{of the present study}} is the representativeness of the pediatric admissions data. Through support from the HIE network of Shanghai, we included data from three pediatric <b>hospitals</b> for a <b>total</b> 10, 000 outpatient and 2000 emergency admissions, covering over 75 % of the total pediatric admissions of Shanghai during the study period. The main limitation of this study is the high degree of heterogeneity of the <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> data, because the data collected from the HIE network were not well organized into different clinical departments. Thus, we did not analyze the associations between environment measurements and admissions to clinical departments. Different clinical departments dealing with different diseases have different admission trends and different responses to adverse environmental conditions (Fig  2). Regression analysis for <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> was therefore missing many details of such associations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Advances in {{healthcare}} have improved {{the survival of}} children with neurological disabilities (ND). Studies in the US have shown that children with ND use a substantial proportion of resources in children’s hospitals, however, {{little research has been}} conducted in the UK. We aimed to test the hypothesis that children with neurological disabilities use more inpatient resources than children without neurological disabilities, and to quantify any significant differences in resource use. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted, looking at the number of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions,</b> <b>total</b> inpatient days and the reason for admissions for paediatric inpatients from January 1 st to March 31 st 2015. Inpatients were assigned into one of three groups: children without ND, children with one ND, and children with more than one ND. Results The sample population included 942 inpatients (mean age 6 y 6 mo). Children with at least one ND accounted for 15. 3 % of the inpatients, 17. 7 % of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> inpatient <b>admission</b> episodes, and 27. 8 % of the total inpatients days. Neurological disability had a statistically significant effect on <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> (p <  0. 001). Neurological disability also had a statistically significant effect on total inpatient days (p <  0. 001). Neurological disability increased the length of inpatient stay across medicine, specialties, and surgery. Conclusions Children with ND had more frequent <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> episode and longer inpatient stays. We identified a smaller group within this population, with arguably more complex neurological disabilities, children with more than one ND. This group had the highest number of admissions and longest inpatient stays. More frequent <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> and longer inpatient stays may place children with ND at greater risk of the adverse effects of hospitalisations. We recommend further investigations looking at each the effects of the different categories of ND on inpatient resource use, and repeat of this study at a national level and {{over a longer period of}} time...|$|R
40|$|Few studies {{adequately}} document {{adverse events}} in patients receiving long, slow, and overnight hemodialysis (NHD). Concerns about {{high rates of}} dialysis access complications have been raised. This is an observational cohort study comparing <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates for vascular access complications between alternate nightly NHD (n= 63) and conventional hemodialysis (n= 172) patients established on chronic hemodialysis for at least 3 months. Overall, <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates and <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates for cardiac and all infective events are also reported. The NHD cohort was younger {{and less likely to}} be female, diabetic, or have ischemic heart disease than the conventional hemodialysis cohort. When NHD and buttonhole cannulation technique were used simultaneously, there was a demonstrated increased risk of septic dialysis access events: incidence rate ratio 3. 0 (95 % confidence interval 1. 04 - 8. 66) (P= 0. 04). The majority of blood culture isolates in NHD patients were gram-positive organisms, particularly Staphylococcus aureus. Alternate nightly NHD did not significantly change <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> or <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for indications other than dialysis access complications, compared with conventional hemodialysis. Our data suggest that buttonhole cannulation technique should be used with caution in patients performing extended-hours hemodialysis as this combination appears to increase the risk of septic access complications.

40|$|Context: Few {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to quantify {{the effect of the}} epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on demand for health care in developing countries. More data are required to improve understanding of its impact and to guide development of appropriate response strategies. Objective: To assess the HIV/AIDS epidemic's impact on demand for inpatient hospital care in a rural area of South Africa. Design: Retrospective analysis of data from general hospital and individual ward admission registers, a tuberculosis program database, and patient case notes. Setting and Patients: Patients admitted between 1991 and 1998 to a 450 -bed hospital that serves Hlabisa District, South Africa (population approximate to 200 000), where HIV seroprevalence among antenatal clinic attendees increased from 4 % in 1992 to 29 % in 1998, Main Outcome: Measures Number of <b>admissions</b> to 9 <b>hospital</b> wards, number of clinical AIDS and general medical admissions (both excluding tuberculosis), and number of tuberculosis admissions to adult medical wards during the study period. Results: <b>Total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> increased by 81 %, from 6562 in 1991 to 11 872 in 1998, Adult tuberculosis ward admissions increased by 360 %, from 303 to 1393, In 1998, tuberculosis patients accounted for 47 % and 30 % of adult male and female medical ward admissions, respectively, and for 11 % of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> Nontuberculosis clinical AIDS cases increased 43 -fold, accounting for 4 % of adult medical admissions in 1997 vs 0. 2 % in 1991. Tuberculosis and nontuberculosis clinical AIDS cases were the only types of admission to show a clear and consistent upward trend over the period studied. Patterns in other types of admissions varied more and changes were smaller. Conclusions: The HIV/AIDS epidemic has had an important impact on demand for adult tuberculosis and general medical care in a rural South African district hospital.

Admissions were categorized by sex, age (or = 75 yrs), site of PUD lesion (stomach or duodenum), main complication (hemorrhage or perforation), and final outcome (intended as fatal outcome: in-hospital death; nonfatal outcome: patient discharged alive). Temporal patterns in PUD admissions were assessed in two ways, considering a) total counts per single month and season, and b) prevalence proportion, such as the monthly prevalence of PUD admissions divided by the monthly prevalence of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions,</b> to assess if the temporal patterns in the raw data might be the consequence of seasonal and annual variations in <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> per se in the region.

We calculated trends in crude and adjusted (for age, sex, ethnic group, social deprivation, and Charlson comorbidity score) admissions for hypoglycaemia; in admissions for hypoglycaemia per <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> and per diabetes prevalence in England; and in length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and 1 month readmissions for hypoglycaemia. FINDINGS: 79   172 people had 101   475 admissions for hypoglycaemia between 2005 and 2014, of which 72   568 (72 %) occurred in people aged 60 years or older. 13   924 (18 %) people {{had more than one}} admission for hypoglycaemia during the study period. The number of admissions increased steadily from 7868 in 2005, to 11   756 in 2010 (49 % increase) and then remained more stable until 2014 (10   977; 39 % increase from baseline, range across English regions 11 - 89 %); the trend was similar after adjustment for risk factors, with a rate ratio of 1 · 53 (95 % CI 1 · 29 - 1 · 81) for 2014 versus 2005. Admissions for hypoglycaemia per 100   000 <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> increased from 63 · 6 to 78 · 9 between 2005 - 06 and 2010 - 11 (24 % increase), and then fell to 72 · 3 per 100   000 in 2013 - 14 (14 % overall increase). Accounting for diabetes prevalence data, rates declined from 4 · 64 to 3 · 86 admissions per 1000 person-years with diabetes between 2010 - 11 and 2013 - 14. We were unable to compare prevalence rates with data prior to 2010, as the populations were not comparable; data were available for all individuals prior to 2010 but only for those aged 17 years or older after 2010. With some differences across regions, from 2005 to 2014, the adjusted proportion of admissions to receive same-day discharge increased by 43 · 8 % (from 18 · 9 to 27 · 1 same-day discharges per 100 admissions); in-hospital mortality decreased by 46 · 3 % (from 4 · 2 to 2 · 3 deaths per 100 admissions); and 1 month readmissions decreased by 63 · 0 % (from 48 · 1 to 17 · 8 per 100 readmissions). INTERPRETATION: Over 10 years, <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in England for hypoglycaemia increased by 39 % in absolute terms and by 14 % considering the general increase in hospitalisation; however, accounting for diabetes prevalence, there was a reduction of <b>admission</b> rates. <b>Hospital</b> length of stay, mortality, and 1 month readmissions decreased progressively and consistently during the study period.

To determine whether the reemergence of malaria in western Kenya could be attributed to changes in meteorologic conditions, we tested for trends in a continuous 30 -year monthly malaria incidence dataset (1966 – 1995) obtained from complete hospital registers at a Kenyan tea plantation. Contemporary monthly meteorologic data (1966 – 1995) that originated from the tea estate meteorologic station and from global climatology records were also tested for trends.

Objective: To investigate morbidity and mortality associated with heatwaves in metropolitan Adelaide using ambulance, <b>hospital</b> <b>admission,</b> and mortality data. Design, participants and setting: Case-series study comparing health risks in the Adelaide metropolitan population during heatwaves and non-heatwave periods. Main outcome measures: Daily observations for ambulance transports (1993 – 2006), <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> (1993 – 2006), and mortality (1993 – 2004), categorised using International classification of diseases (ninth and tenth revisions) codes for the relevant disease groups. Results: During heatwaves, total ambulance transport increased by 4 % (95 % CI, 1 %– 7 %), including significant assault-related increases for people aged 15 – 64 years. Reductions were observed in relation to cardiac, sports- and falls-related events. <b>Total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> increased by 7 % (95 % CI, − 1 % to 16 %). Total mental health admissions increased by 7 % (95 % CI, 1 %– 13 %), and total renal admissions by 13 % (95 % CI, 3 %– 25 %). Ischaemic heart disease admissions increased by 8 % (95 % CI, 1 %– 15 %) among people aged 65 – 74 years. Total mortality, disease- and age-specific mortality did not increase, apart from a small increase in mental health-related mortality in people aged 65 – 74 years. Significant decreases were observed in cardiovascular-related mortality. Conclusion: In contrast to evidence from extreme heatwaves in the northern hemisphere, we found no excess mortality during heatwaves in metropolitan Adelaide, perhaps because of adaptive behaviour to regular hot weather spells. Projected temperature increases and evidence of modest increases in morbidity during heatwaves indicate the need for a heatwave response plan for Adelaide.

Sulfur dioxide harms human health by reacting with the {{moisture in the}} nose, nasal cavity and throat {{and this is the}} way by which it destroys the nerves in the respiratory system. Objectives The aim of this study was to focus on identifying the effects associated with sulfur dioxide on health in Ahvaz, Iran. Materials and Methods Data collections were performed by Ahvaz meteorological organization and the department of environment. Sampling was performed for 24 hours in four stations. Methods of sampling and analysis were according to US environmental protection agency (EPA) guideline. Afterwards, we processed the raw data including instruction set correction of averaging, coding and filtering by Excel software and then, the impact of meteorological parameters were converted as the input file to the AirQ model. Finally, we calculated the health effects of exposure to sulfur dioxide. Results According to the findings, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in Ahvaz had an annual average of 51 μg/m 3.

40|$|Background Acute {{poisoning}} {{in children}} (APC) is a preventable cause of pediatric emergency visits. Patterns of acute poisoning in children {{are different in}} various regions and times. Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the epidemiology of acute poisoning in children, who were referred to the emergency department of Qods teaching hospital in Qazvin, Iran. Methods In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, all children younger than 13 years old, admitted to the Qods teaching hospital in Qazvin (Iran), were assessed during September 2009 to September 2012. Demographic and clinical symptoms and signs of poisoned cases, poisonous agents and outcome of patients were studied. Results Four hundreds and thirty-four (2. 59 % of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admission)</b> patients with APC were admitted to the emergency department during the study period; 63. 36 % were male. Overall, 345 (79. 5 %) cases were under 6 years old. Drugs (265 cases) were common agents for APC. The ingestion route was responsible in 391 of APC. Methadone, benzodiazepines and kerosene were the most frequent poisonous agents. Neurologic symptoms and signs (256 cases) were the most common presentation of APC. Forty-five patients (10. 36 %) were admitted to the PICU. Three deaths (% 0. 06) occurred with monoxide carbon and methadone poisoning. Monoxide carbon poisoning was the deadliest agent. Conclusions Acute poisoning in children is a serious preventable cause of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> It is one of the differential diagnoses in patients with sudden onset of neurological, alimentary, respiratory symptoms and signs, who are visited at the emergency department. Parental awareness and education about keeping potential poisoning agents safely is essential to reduce APC in children...|$|R
40|$|Herpes zoster (HZ) is {{a disease}} caused by the {{reactivation}} of the latent α-herpes virus varicella zoster virus (VZV), for which, in Italy, a specific surveillance system does not exist, but around 200 [*] 000 cases are estimated each year. In older patients, who {{are at increased risk}} of developing HZ, symptoms are more severe and the chances to develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), the most severe complication, are substantially higher. A vaccine against HZ with demonstrated efficacy and an acceptable safety profile is now available and is recommended in Europe for adults > 50 years. In anticipation of the possible introduction of an immunization programme for the elderly in Tuscany, the burden of disease caused by HZ and its complications was assessed through a retrospective analysis of the hospital discharge records between 2002 and 2012, using the ICD- 9 -CM 053 code. In the period 2002 - 2012, 4475 <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> were registered with annual means of 368 hospitalizations and 39 day-hospital admissions. Most of the hospitalizations (68 %) involved subjects > 65 years; the mean length of stay was 9. 5 days. Slightly more than half (51. 2 %) of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> were complicated cases. The most frequent were neurological complications (24. 2 % of total admissions), followed by ophthalmic complications (16. 5 %). Cases with neurological complications were those with the higher average length of stay and higher average costs for case. This study confirmed the epidemiological impact of HZ and its complications and the positive impact on morbidity that the introduction of the HZ vaccination could have in older age groups...|$|R
40|$|Total-body CT (TBCT) {{scanning}} in trauma {{patients is}} being increasingly used in trauma assessment. One {{of the major}} disadvantages of CT scanning {{is the amount of}} radiation exposure involved. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the number of radiological investigations and their associated radiation exposure in multitrauma patients before and after the introduction of a total-body CT protocol as a primary diagnostic tool. The Trauma Registry was used to identify trauma patients admitted to our Level 1 trauma centre in 2008 (pre-TBCT protocol) and 2010 (post-TBCT protocol). Consecutive patients with an Injury Severity Score of ≥ 16 were included. Patients aged 16 or under, referrals from other hospitals and patients with specific low-energy injury mechanisms were excluded. Subsequent effective doses were estimated from literature and from dose calculations. Three hundred one patients were included, 150 patients pre- and 151 post-introduction of the TBCT protocol. Demographics were comparable. In 2008, 20 % of severely injured patients underwent total-body CT scan, compared with 46 % of the patients in 2010. Trauma room radiation doses for conventional radiographs were significantly higher in 2008, while doses for CT scans were significantly lower. The total effective dose of trauma room radiological investigations was 16 milliSieverts (mSv) in 2008 vs. 24 mSv in 2010 (P[*]=[*] 0. 223). The overall effective dose during the <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> was not significantly different between 2008 and 2010 (20 vs. 24 mSv, P[*]=[*] 0. 509). In conlusion, after the introduction of a dedicated TBCT protocol, the TBCT rate was more than doubled. Although this increased the CT-induced trauma room radiation dose, the overall radiation dose throughout <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> was comparable between patients in 2008 and 201...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are {{a frequent}} cause of mortality and morbidity to patients worldwide, with great associated {{costs to the}} healthcare providers including the NHS in England. We examined trends in <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> associated with adverse drug reaction in English hospitals and the accuracy of national reporting. METHODS: Data from the Hospital Episode Statistics database (collected by the Department of Health) was obtained and analysed for all English hospital episodes (1998 - 2005) using ICD- 10 codes with a primary (codes including the words ('drug-induced' or 'due to') or secondary diagnosis of ADR (Y 40 - 59). More detailed analysis was performed for the year 2004 - 2005 RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2005 there were 447 071 ADRs representing 0. 50 % of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> episodes and over this period the number of ADRs increased by 45 %. All ADRs with an external code increased over this period. In 2005 {{the total number of}} episodes (all age groups) was 13, 706, 765 of which 76, 692 (0. 56 %) were drug related. Systemic agents, which include anti-neoplastic drugs, were the most implicated class (15. 7 %), followed by analgesics (11. 7 %) and cardiovascular drugs (10. 1 %). There has been a 6 fold increase in nephropathy secondary to drugs and a 65 % decline in drug induced extra-pyramidal side effects. 59 % of cases involving adverse drug reactions involved patients above 60 years of age. CONCLUSION: ADRs have major public health and economic implications. Our data suggest that national Hospital Episode Statistics in England have recognised limitations and that consequently, admissions associated with adverse drug reactions continue to be under-recorded. External causes of ADR have increased at a greater rate than the increase in <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> Improved and more detailed reporting combined with educational interventions to improve the recording of ADRs are needed to accurately monitor the morbidity caused by ADRs and to meaningfully evaluate national initiatives to reduce adverse drug reactions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Rheumatic {{diseases}} {{are becoming more}} and more common in Poland with the ageing of the population. Nearly 18 % of the <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in Poland result from rheumatic diseases, which was equivalent to 350 thousand cases in the year 2008. These diseases tend to last for many decades, decreasing both the quality of life and income of the patients as well as increasing the medical institutions’ workload and society’s financial burden. The aim of the study was to determine whether the medical care parameters in a rheumatic disease hospital ward show any significant differences among different patient age groups – especially such that would support taking them into account as a basis for adjusting the financial coverage level of medical services. Material and methods : Data on hospitalizations at the Rheumatic Diseases Ward of Wroclaw University Hospital in Wroclaw in the years 2009 – 2015 were analyzed, taking into account the age groups, number of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions,</b> their duration and causes. Relevant statistical data analysis was performed. Discussion: The study revealed that the number of old patients hospitalized at the rheumatic diseases ward increased over the last 6 years and that such statistically significant differences do exist: on average the old patients not only tend to stay much longer at the hospital, but also suffer from a different and more diverse spectrum of diseases in comparison to their younger counterparts. Conclusions : The detected differences in medical care parameters support the need for more individualized medical care and increased cost of the hospital stay in the case of older patients. Consequently, those factors justify the necessity to increase the value of medical services in the case of old patients, possibly also taking into account the variation between age subgroups...|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{projections}} {{have drawn}} {{attention to the}} risks of extreme heat {{and the importance of}} public health interventions to minimise the impact. The city of Perth, Western Australia, frequently experiences hot summer conditions, with recent summers showing above average temperatures. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures, mortality, emergency department (ED) presentations and <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> data were acquired for Perth for the period 1994 to 2008. Using an observed/expected analysis, the temperature thresholds for mortality were estimated at 34 - 36 °C (maximum) and 20 °C (minimum). Generalised estimating equations (GEEs) were used to estimate the percentage increase in mortality and morbidity outcomes with a 10 °C increment in temperature, with adjustment for air pollutants. Effect estimates are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRRs). The health impact of heatwave days (three or more days of ≥ 35 °C) was also investigated. A 9. 8 % increase in daily mortality (IRR 1. 098; 95 %CI: 1. 007 - 1. 196) was associated with a 10 °C increase in maximum temperature above threshold. Total ED presentations increased by 4. 4 % (IRR 1. 044; 95 %CI: 1. 033 - 1. 054) and renal-related ED presentations by 10. 2 % (IRR 1. 102; 95 %CI: 1. 071 - 1. 135) per 10 °C increase in maximum temperature. Heatwave days were associated with increases in daily mortality and ED presentations, while <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> were decreased on heatwave days. Public health interventions will be increasingly important to minimise the adverse health impacts of hot weather in Perth, particularly if the recent trend of rising average temperatures and more hot days continues as projected.

40|$|Lung {{carcinoma}} is the commonest major malignancy in {{men in the}} United States and its incidence {{is increasing}} rapidly in women. It is estimated that there will have been 117, 000 new cases and 101, 300 deaths in 1980. The 2286 patients with lung carcinoma admitted to the Hospital of the University of Mississippi from 1955 to 1980 were reviewed by decades of chronology and of life, with respect to age, cell type, sex and racial incidence. The greatest age incidence was in the sixth and seventh decades; cell types overall were epidermoid (45 % of the patients), adenocarcinoma (12 % of the patients), small (oat) cell (21 % of the patients), and others (22 % of the patients). There was a steady increase {{in the incidence of}} disease in females, adjusted for <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions,</b> and a less certain increase among black patients. Twenty-eight per cent of 250 patients with small cell carcinoma so studied exhibited some feature of the paraneoplastic or paraendocrine syndromes. In 41 patients with small cell carcinoma treated with multiple drug chemotherapy, there was an overall response rate of 50 % and an additional "stable disease" rate of 28 %. Mean survival period in this group was 52 weeks, compared with 12 weeks in patients whose diseases went untreated. Clearly, definite progress is being made, not only in our knowledge of the biology of lung carcinoma, in general, but in the treatment of small cell carcinoma in particular...|$|R
40|$|Pay-for-performance {{programs}} offering {{additional payments}} to GPs {{can be used}} not only {{to improve the quality}} of care but also for cost containment purposes. In this paper, we analyse the impact of removing financial incentives in primary care that were aimed at containing hospital expenditure in the Italian region of Emilia Romagna during the period 2002 - 04. Our analysis draws on regional databanks linking GPs' characteristics to those of their patients (including all sources of public payments made to GPs), together with information on the utilisation of hospital services. We employ a difference-in-difference specification to assess changes in expenditures for avoidable and <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> We identify the treatment group with GPs operating in districts where the program is withdrawn during the observation period ("Leavers"). Their performance is compared to that of two separate control groups, namely: GPs working in districts that grant incentives for the entire period ("Stayers"), and those working in districts that never introduced measures for the containment of hospitalisations ("Non Participants"). The comparison between treatment and control groups shows that removing incentives does not result in a worse performance by Leavers compared to both control groups. This supports the policy of removing incentives, as such entail extra payments to GPs which, however, do not seem capable of significantly influencing their behaviour in the desired ways. Our findings complement previous evidence from the same institutional context showing that only those programs that aim to improve disease management for specific conditions - rather than to simply contain expenditure - have proven successful in reducing avoidable admissions for the target population...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Racial disparities exist across {{most major}} disease categories, which {{result in a}} disproportionately large number of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for many conditions. Estimates for the {{financial}} impact of the racial admission differences for the State of South Carolina are assessed. METHODS: South Carolina hospital discharge data for 1998 - 2002 {{was used for the}} analysis. The database includes all-payer billing data for inpatient <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> as received on the UB- 92 billing file for the covered episode. Charges were inflation adjusted to 2002 constant dollars. RESULTS: For 1998 - 2002, there were an estimated dollar 1. 6 billion in <b>total</b> charges for <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in South Carolina that were attributed to higher age-adjusted admission rates for African-American patients. In addition, African Americans had consistently higher <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates for disease categories that are often associated with a failure to obtain ambulatory and preventive care. CONCLUSION: This simple analysis reveals that age-adjusted <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates for African Americans in South Carolina are higher than for Caucasians, and the gap appears to be widening over time. Given the magnitude of the financial implication, interventions with even a small impact on the conditions underlying the racial disparities in <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> are likely to be cost effective...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{sought to}} {{characterize}} the aggregate features and survival of patients who receive inpatient palliative care con-sultation, particularly focusing on patients with cancer, to identify opportunities to improve clinical outcomes. Methods: We reviewed prospectively collected data on pa-tients seen by the Palliative Care Inpatient Consult Service at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 2003 to September 2008. Demographics, consultation characteristics, and survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox sur-vival models. Results: Cancer {{was the most common}} primary diagnosis (47 %) in the 1, 794 patients seen over the 5 -year period. A sig-nificant growth in the annual number of palliative care consulta-tions has been observed (113 in 2003 v 414 in 2007), despite stable <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> Frequently encountered rea-sons for consultation included clarification of care goals (29 %), assistance with dismissal planning (19 %), and pain control (17 %). Although patients with cancer had the highest median survival after consultation in this cohort versus patients with other diagnoses, we observed a 5 -year trend of decreasing survival from admission to death and from consultation to death. Median time from admission to death for patients with cancer was 36 days in 2003 and only 19 days in 2008 (P. 01). Median time from consultation to death decreased from 33 days in 2003 to only 11. 5 days in 2008 (P. 01). Conclusion: Patients with cancer often have complex needs that must be met within a short window for intervention. We highlight opportunities for improved multidisciplinary care for pa-tients with advanced cancer and their families, including oppor-tunity for earlier palliative care involvement, even in the outpatient setting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe planned annual Hajj to {{the holy}} shrines in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is {{recognized}} as one of the largest recurring religious mass gatherings globally, and the outbreak of infectious diseases is of major concern. We aim to study the incidence, etiology, risk factors, length of hospital stay, and mortality rate of pneumonia amongst pilgrims admitted to Al-Ansar general hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia during the Hajj period of December 2004 –November 2013. A retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed and admitted as pneumonia was done. Patients were assessed according to the CURB- 65 scoring system and admitted to the ward or intensive care unit accordingly. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and blood culture were collected prior to antibiotic treatment. 1059 patients were included in the study (23 % of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> and 20 % of ICU admissions). The mean age of participants was 56. 8 years, the Male:Female ratio was 3 : 1, and the lengths of stay in the ward and intensive care units were 5 and 14. 5 days, respectively. The main organisms cultured from sputum were Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Haemophilus Influenzae, Staphylococcus Aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and community-acquired MRSA. The mortality rate in the ward was 2. 4 %, while the rate in the ICU was 21. 45 %. The organisms which caused pneumonia were found to be different during Hajj. The usual standard guideline for the treatment of pneumonia was ineffective for the causative organisms. Therefore, specific adjustments in the guidelines are needed. All efforts should be made to determine the infectious agent. Healthcare workers and pilgrims should adhere to preventive measures...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the long-term {{effectiveness of a}} complex intervention in primary care aimed at improving outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease. DESIGN: A 6 -year follow-up of a cluster randomised controlled trial, which found after 18  months that both <b>total</b> and cardiovascular <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> were significantly reduced in intervention practices (8 % absolute reduction). SETTING: 48 general practices in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: 903 patients with established coronary heart disease at baseline in the original trial. INTERVENTION: The original intervention consisted of tailored practice and patient plans; training sessions for practitioners in medication prescribing and behavioural change; and regular patient recall system. Control practices provided usual care. Following the intervention period, all supports from the research team to intervention practices ceased. PRIMARY OUTCOME: <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions,</b> all cause and cardiovascular; secondary outcomes: mortality; blood pressure and cholesterol control. RESULTS: At 6 -year follow-up, {{data were collected from}} practice records of 696 patients (77 %). For those who had died, we censored their data at the point of death and cause of death was established. There {{were no significant differences between}} the intervention and control practices in either total (OR 0. 83 (95 % CI 0. 54 to 1. 28)) or cardiovascular <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> (OR 0. 91 (95 % CI 0. 49 to 1. 65)). We confirmed mortality status of 886 of the original 903 patients (98 %). There were no significant differences in mortality (15 % in intervention and 16 % in control) or in the proportions of patients above target control for systolic blood pressure or total cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Initial significant differences in the numbers of <b>total</b> and cardiovascular <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> were not maintained at 6  years and no differences were found in mortality or blood pressure and cholesterol control. Policymakers need to continue to assess the effectiveness of previously efficacious programmes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 24081411...|$|R
40|$|Background: As many as 50 % of <b>total</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> are readmissions. Because {{the factors}} {{contributing}} to hospital readmission are multiple, and research findings are not conclusive, {{it is important for}} clinicians to gain an understanding of the key factors that contribute to readmission. Objectives. -This study explores the {{factors contributing to}} hospital readmission and derives an explanatory model that can best identify characteristics of patients at high risk for hospital readmission. Methods: This research was a case-controlled study with readmitted patients (n = 168) as the readmitted group and non-readmitted patients (n = 98) as the control group. The variables included demographic data, health assessment data, medical diagnosis, frequency of admissions, severity of illness, intensity of service and improvement of condition. The study sample was also interviewed to explore the patients' views on their repeated hospitalization. Results: In the bivariate analysis significant differences between the study and control groups were multiple and generally consistent with findings in other studies. Using multiple logistic regression, however, the final model shows that only three factors best predict readmissions: frequency (3 - 4 times) of readmissions (OR = 9. 96, p <. 0001) and frequency (more than 5 times) of readmissions (OR = 15. 73, p <. 0001), financial assistance (OR = 5. 03, p <. 001), and severity of illness (OR = 3. 12, p <. 01). Our interview data suggest that the readmitted patients required assistance to accomplish daily living activities upon discharge and often returned to the hospital for the same health reason. Conclusion: The study findings suggest that patients who are frequently readmitted to the hospital are severely ill; are on public assistance; and may need special attention when discharged in order to attenuate repeated hospital readmission.
