25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to <b>ask</b> <b>those</b> question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E
2500|$|Due to a law {{dating from}} 1872, the French Republic prohibits {{performing}} census by making distinction between its citizens regarding their race or their beliefs. However, that {{law does not}} concern surveys and polls, which are free to <b>ask</b> <b>those</b> questions if they wish. The law also allows for an exception for public {{institutions such as the}} INED or the INSEE {{whose job it is to}} collect data on demographics, social trends and other related subjects, on condition that the collection of such data has been authorized by the CNIL and the National Council of Statistical Information (...)

2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Leonor distanced {{herself from}} her son-in-law, because, among other reasons, the king did not appoint {{one of her}} {{favorites}} as the Chief Rabbi of the Jews of Castile. The dowager queen began to <b>ask</b> <b>those</b> who supported her to defend the master of Aviz and not the king of Castile, and also wrote to the cities that the Castilian king had tried to occupy to refuse their obedience to him. When the king marched to Coimbra, accompanied by his wife and mother-in-law, the city was already {{under the protection of}} Gonçalo Teles, Leonor's brother, as well as her uncle Gonçalo Mendes de Vasconcelos. Leonor participated in a conspiracy to kill her son-in-law and, according to the chronicler Fernão Lopes, was discovered in the presence of her daughter Beatrice, who confronted her mother saying: [...] "Oh Lady mother, in a year you wanted to see me a widow, orphan and disinherited?".|$|E
2500|$|William Griffith Wilson (November 26, 1895 – January 24, 1971), {{also known}} as Bill Wilson or Bill W., was the co-founder of [...] Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), an {{international}} [...] mutual aid fellowship with over twenty million members worldwide belonging to approximately 10,000 groups, associations, organizations, cooperatives, and fellowships of alcoholics helping other alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety. [...] Following [...] AA's Twelfth Tradition of anonymity, Wilson {{is commonly known as}} [...] "Bill W." [...] or [...] "Bill." [...] In order to communicate among one another, members of [...] "AA" [...] will often <b>ask</b> <b>those</b> who appear to be suffering or having a relapse from alcoholism if they are [...] "friends with Bill". Although this question can be confusing, because [...] "Bill" [...] is a common name, it does provide a means of establishing a rapport with those who are familiar with the saying and in need of help. After Wilson's death in 1971, and amidst much controversy within the fellowship, his full name was included in obituaries by journalists who were unaware of the significance for maintaining anonymity within the organization.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 July 1940 the Special Operations Executive (SOE) {{was founded}} in Britain with orders from Churchill to [...] "set Europe ablaze". The F Section of the SOE was headed by Maurice Buckmaster and {{provided}} invaluable support for the resistance. From May 1941, Freney founded Combat, {{one of the first}} Resistance groups. Frenay recruited for Combat by asking people such questions like if they believed that Britain would not be defeated and if they thought a German victory was worth stopping, and based on the answers he received would <b>ask</b> <b>those</b> whom he thought were inclined to resistance: [...] "Men are already gathering in the shadows. Will you join them?". Frenay, who was to emerge as one of the leading resistance chefs, later wrote: [...] "I myself never attacked a den of collaborators or derailed trains. I never killed a German or a Gestapo agent with my own hand". For security reasons, Combat was divided into a series of cells that were unaware of each other. Another early resistance groups founded in the summer of 1940 was the ill-fated Interallié group led by a Polish émigré Roman Czerniawski and a Frenchwoman Mathilde Carré codenamed La Chatte (the cat) that passed on intelligence from contacts in the Deuxième Bureau to Britain via couriers from Marseilles.|$|E

60|$|Again, every useless citizen may {{be fairly}} {{regarded}} as a pernicious man; and let us <b>ask</b> <b>those</b> illustrious philosophers who have taught us what insects reproduce themselves curiously, in what ratio bodies attract one another in space, what curves have conjugate points, points of inflection or reflection, what in the planetary revolutions are the relations of areas traversed in equal times--let us <b>ask</b> <b>those</b> who have attained all this sublime knowledge, by how much the worse governed, less flourishing, or less perverse {{we should have been}} if they had attained none of it? Now if the works of our most scientific men and best citizens lead to such small utility, tell us what we are to think of the crowd of obscure writers and idle men of letters who devour the public substance in pure loss.|$|E
6000|$|The Marquis looked slightingly at the {{signed and}} sealed paper which Captain Dalgetty handed to him, and, {{throwing}} it with contempt upon a table, <b>asked</b> <b>those</b> around {{him what he}} deserved who came as the avowed envoy and agent of malignant traitors, in arms against the state? ...|$|R

60|$|So also {{my father}} {{seemed to me}} to have become all at once bigger and more dignified, talking with a vigour and an {{enjoyment}} that sat newly on him.

50|$|In the United States Congress, {{divisions}} are used, {{but not in}} the same manner as in the British Parliament. In Congress, lobbies are not used, and the division is not a final determination of the question. The vote is first taken by voice vote, as is the case in Parliament. Then, any member may demand a division. If a division is demanded, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives (or, more commonly, a Representative of the majority party designated by the Speaker to preside as Speaker pro tempore) or the Presiding Officer of the Senate <b>asks</b> <b>those</b> voting Yea to rise and remain standing until counted, and then <b>asks</b> <b>those</b> voting Nay to do the same. A division is the least common method of voting in the Senate.|$|R
