5|$|Because Stretford is {{situated}} on the main A56 road between Chester and Manchester many travellers passed through the village, and as this traffic increased, more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the stagecoach; the Angel Hotel, on the present day site {{of what used to}} be the Bass Drum public house, was one of the main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford, and the Trafford Arms was another. The stagecoach service through Stretford is believed to have ended some time in the 1840s, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> horse-drawn omnibuses arrived, in 1845. The Manchester Carriage Company's tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879, terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road, next to which a small depot was built to house the cars and horses. A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10minutes between 8:00am and 10:15pm. The horse-drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902, and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.|$|E

In England, following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved {{in the direction of the}} Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.|$|E
25|$|Huldah Hawley {{was born}} in 1755 and died in 1856 {{at the age of}} 101.

This high rocky bluff, at the time, commanded a view of Long Island Sound for , and was used to spy on British ships. Hawley said the soldiers ordered her to cook for them, and she furnished them with provisions for fear that they would kill her. French coins have since been found near the site of their camp in Abraham Nichols Park.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} the first humans to arrive {{in the area that}} would become Maryland {{appeared}} around the 10th millennium BC, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the last ice age ended. They were hunter-gatherers organized into semi-nomadic bands. They adapted as the region's environment changed, developing the spear for hunting as smaller animals, like deer, became more prevalent, and by about 1500 BC oysters had become an important food resource in the region. With the increased variety of food sources, Native American villages and settlements started appearing and their social structures increased in complexity. By about 1000 BC pottery was being produced. With the eventual rise of agriculture more permanent Native-American villages were built. But even with the advent of farming, hunting and fishing were still important means of obtaining food. The bow and arrow were first used for hunting in the area around the year 800. They ate what they could kill, grow or catch in the rivers and other waterways.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{two hours}} elapsed {{between the time}} the ships got under way until the opening shots were fired. In that time, they found that New Ironsides had severe {{handling}} problems in the strong current and shallow water. She was forced to stop and anchor to avoid going aground, just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the lead monitors were coming under fire. She {{dropped out of the}} line, and the four ships following her passed around, with some difficulty. The waiting Rebels could not have chosen a better place for New Ironsides to anchor, as she was directly over a 3000-pound (1360kg) electrically-triggered torpedo that would be activated by closing a switch on shore. Their high hopes were dashed, however, when the switch was closed and nothing happened. Two explanations for the failure have been offered. According to the one, an ordnance wagon had broken the wires by being driven over them. The other holds that the wires were simply too long, so the electric current would not be great enough to create a spark and detonate the charge.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Chickamauga opened {{almost by}} accident, when pickets from Col. Daniel McCook's brigade of Granger's Reserve Corps moved toward Jay's Mill In search of water.

His men {{established}} a defensive position several hundred yards northwest of Jay's Mill, about equally distant from where the 1st Georgia Cavalry waited through the night south of the mill. At <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> McCook sent a regiment to destroy Reed's Bridge (which would survive the second attempt in two days to destroy it), Brig. Gen. Henry Davidson of Forrest's Cavalry Corps sent the 1st Georgia forward and they encountered some of McCook's men near the mill. McCook was ordered by Granger to withdraw back to Rossville and his men were pursued by Davidson's troopers. McCook encountered Thomas at the LaFayette Road, having finished an all-night march from Crawfish Springs. McCook reported to Thomas that a single Confederate infantry brigade was trapped {{on the west side}} of Chickamauga Creek. Thomas told Brannan's division to attack and destroy it.|$|E

25|$|A.P. Hill's {{division}} {{had moved}} across Beaver Dam Creek {{early in the}} morning, finding the former Union line lightly defended. As they proceeded eastward and approached Gaines's Mill at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> D.H. Hill's men were engaged, Porter formally asked McClellan to send Slocum's division across the Chickahominy over Alexander's Bridge to support him. Hill directed the brigades of Maxcy Gregg and Lawrence O'Bryan Branch to spearhead the assault, as {{they had not been}} engaged at Beaver Dam Creek and were well-rested. Gregg was held up by skirmishers from Col. Hiram Berdan's 1st U.S. Sharpshooters and the 9th Massachusetts Infantry. By early afternoon, he ran into strong opposition by Porter, deployed along Boatswain's Creek and the swampy terrain was a major obstacle against the advance. A particularly bloody engagement occurred as the 1st South Carolina Rifles attacked a Massachusetts battery, but were repulsed by Zouaves of the 5th New York, which inflicted 57% casualties (76 killed, 221 wounded, and 58 missing) on the South Carolinians, the greatest Confederate regimental losses of the day. Branch's brigade fared no better, losing 401 men in two hours of fighting. Following behind them, Joseph R. Anderson's brigade launched three assaults on the Union lines without putting a dent in them. Field's brigade became bogged down in the swamp and some {{of the men in the}} rear ended up firing into their comrades. Some of Gregg's men reached the other side of the creek, none of the rest came close.|$|E
