5|$|D. carnegii (also spelled D. carnegiei), {{named after}} <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie,</b> {{is the best}} known, mainly due to a near-complete {{skeleton}} (specimen CM 84) collected by Jacob Wortman, of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and described and named by John Bell Hatcher in 1901. This was reconsidered as type-species for Diplodocus.|$|E

5|$|Royton Library is a Carnegie library, {{a gift of}} <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie.</b> It {{was opened}} in 1907 by Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley, an aristocrat and former Member of Parliament for the area. The {{surnames}} of four prominent writers—Bacon, Carlyle, Spencer and Milton—are inscribed above one of four windows on the building face, by the entrance.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore Public Library, {{the only}} {{structure}} {{on the east}} side of Main Street, between State and Page Streets, that is included in the Sycamore Historic District. The library, still operational today, was constructed in 1905 with a combination of philanthropical gifts from different sources including <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie.</b> The building was designed, in part, by architect Paul O. Moratz.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this has}} {{probably}} been due to its wealth of skeletal remains and former status as the longest dinosaur. The donation of many mounted skeletal casts by industrialist <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie</b> to potentates around {{the world at the}} beginning of the 20th century did much to familiarize it to people worldwide. Casts of Diplodocus skeletons are still displayed in many museums worldwide, including D. carnegii in a number of institutions.|$|E

5|$|Serving {{the general}} {{educational}} needs of the local population are two public library districts, the Spokane Public Library (within city limits) and the Spokane County Library District. Founded in 1904 with funding from philanthropist <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie,</b> the Spokane Public Library system comprises a downtown library overlooking the Spokane Falls and five branch libraries. Special collections focus on Inland Pacific Northwest history and include reference books, periodicals, maps, photographs, and other archival materials and government documents.|$|E
5|$|The Harrisburg Mitchell-Carnegie Library, {{located on}} Church Street {{south of the}} square and built with a grant from <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie,</b> was built in 1908 and {{opened to the public}} in 1909. The {{building}} served the community until 2000 when the library was moved to a new building on north Main Street. During the 1937 flood, the library was used as a makeshift hospital until the water boiler burst. The building now serves as a church.|$|E
5|$|Industrialists such as <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie,</b> Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab {{built their}} {{fortunes}} in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements {{as the air}} brake and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks {{played a key role}} in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.|$|E

5|$|The Oregon Public Library {{is located}} in Oregon, Illinois, United States, the county seat of Ogle County. The {{building}} is a public library that was constructed in 1909. Prior to 1909, Oregon's library was housed in different buildings, none of which were designed to house a library. The library was built using a grant from wealthy philanthropist <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie.</b> The grant was obtained after Oregon's citizens voted to change Oregon's library from a city library to a township library. The building was completed by 1908 but the library did not begin operation until 1909.|$|E
5|$|To avert the {{collapse}} of Moore & Schley, Morgan called an emergency conference at his library Saturday morning. A proposal was made that the U.S. Steel Corporation, a company Morgan had helped form through the merger of the steel companies of <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie</b> and Elbert Gary, would acquire TC This would effectively save Moore & Schley and avert the crisis. The executives and board of U.S. Steel studied the situation and offered to either loan Moore & Schley $5 million, or buy TC for $90 a share. By 7 p.m. an agreement had not been reached and the meeting adjourned.|$|E
5|$|As {{kerosene}} {{and gasoline}} grew in importance, Rockefeller's wealth soared {{and he became}} the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak. Oil was used throughout {{the country as a}} light source until the introduction of electricity and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry, which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry, and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie,</b> defined the structure of modern philanthropy.|$|E

5|$|Blaine and {{his wife}} and daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and finally Scotland, where they stayed at the summer home of <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie.</b> While in France, Blaine {{wrote a letter to the}} New-York Tribune criticizing Cleveland’s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with Europe would {{impoverish}} American workers and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His letter in the Tribune had raised his political profile even higher, and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E
5|$|Estate house design {{declined}} in {{importance in the}} twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller in the Adam style. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie</b> (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store. There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, Rockefeller {{expanded}} into iron ore and ore transportation, forcing {{a collision with}} steel magnate <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie,</b> and their competition became a major subject of the newspapers and cartoonists. He went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, as the original Pennsylvania oil fields began to play out. Amid the frenetic expansion, Rockefeller {{began to think of}} retirement. The daily management of the trust was turned over to John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, north of New York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} to a family of {{steelworkers}} in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a mill town six miles south of downtown Pittsburgh along the Monongahela River. The town was home to <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie's</b> famous Homestead Steel Works and site of the infamous Homestead Strike.|$|R
50|$|Seven other {{concert halls}} also bear Carnegie's name, {{six of them}} in the USA. There is Carnegie Hall, a 540-seat venue in <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie's</b> native Dunfermline (the first Carnegie Hall in the world); and the famous Carnegie Hall in New York City.|$|R
5|$|On October 12, 1901, the Salem Woman's Club was {{organized}} with {{the wife of}} Oregon Governor Theodore Thurston Geer serving {{as president of the}} organization. Two years later the group started the Salem Public Library at Geer's home, and then later located at Chemeketa and High streets in downtown Salem in the then city hall, with the library's collection totaling 50 books at that time. The library group hired a librarian, Miss F. Phillips, for a salary of $20 per month to run the library. In 1907, the group explored options to build a stand-alone library building using funds provided by <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie,</b> who was providing funds for building libraries around the world.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{political}} moments that brought Berkman and Goldman together was the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania owned by <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie</b> {{became the focus of}} national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.|$|E
5|$|The Baronial style peaked {{towards the}} end of the nineteenth century, and the {{building}} of large houses declined in importance in the twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890 he produced a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller (1864–1906) in the Adam style. The baronial style continued to influence the construction of some estate houses, including Skibo Castle, which was rebuilt for industrialist <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie</b> (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell (1872–1935) designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for the owner of a Moscow department store.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the Trust {{established}} a Centenary Fund {{to celebrate the}} centenary of <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie's</b> original 1901 endowment. The yearly income for this fund (£80,000 in 2004-5) goes towards the appointment of two world-class Carnegie Centenary Professors per year for a sabbatical period in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|He was {{successful}} in the architectural competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie’s</b> gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for 7 libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} also {{housed the}} public library, and was partly {{funded by the}} Carnegie UK Trust which was continuing <b>Andrew</b> <b>Carnegie's</b> project of building libraries across the United Kingdom. Grantham's library is now located in the Isaac Newton Centre, and the museum occupies {{the whole of the}} 1926 building.|$|R
