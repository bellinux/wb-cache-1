5|$|<b>Any</b> <b>blood</b> clot forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such {{an imbalance}} are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E

Dexter realizes that he must protect his secrets, so he begins by cleaning his boat that night with a black light to detect <b>any</b> <b>blood.</b> He is unaware that the marina is being videotaped by the Miami-Metro Police, who believe that the Bay Harbor Butcher may be keeping his boat at that marina.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, {{apparently}} a senior military figure. It is unclear {{if there was}} <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> relationship between the two, {{although it has been}} suggested that Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E

5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|Uric acid has {{the highest}} {{concentration}} of <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> antioxidant and provides {{over half of the}} total antioxidant capacity of human serum. Uric acid's antioxidant activities are also complex, given that it does not react with some oxidants, such as superoxide, but does act against peroxynitrite, peroxides, and hypochlorous acid. Concerns over elevated UA's contribution to gout must be considered as one of many risk factors. By itself, UA-related risk of gout at high levels (415–530 μmol/L) is only 0.5% per year with an increase to 4.5% per year at UA supersaturation levels (535+ μmol/L). Many of these aforementioned studies determined UA's antioxidant actions within normal physiological levels, and some found antioxidant activity at levels as high as 285 μmol/L.|$|E
5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E

25|$|High heels are not {{a modern}} {{invention}} but there is confusion regarding when they were developed. Research shows that high heels {{can be traced back}} to ancient Egypt. In the middle of the second millennium BC, Egyptians began to frequently use sandals. Retention was obtained generally by the Egyptians by a T or V thong passing through the sole. Egyptian butchers also wore heeled shoes for practical purposes, in order to keep their feet clean of <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> while slaughtering animals. Also, a 12th-century (AD) sculpture from Ramappa Temple (India) shows a lady, highly clad in jewelry, wearing high heels.|$|E

It took place on January 19. Apparently to keep <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> from being spilled in their home state of Kentucky, they had chosen a dueling ground in Indiana, directly across the Ohio River from what was then Shippingport, Kentucky and near the mouth of Silver Creek. While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and Marshall planned on killing their opponent.|$|E

Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario, and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men, or join them in their cause, as Smecker had become sympathetic towards the brothers' actions. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.|$|E

25|$|In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of {{gripping}} {{the blade of}} their knife between thumb and forefinger and wiping it clean of <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> following a murder by drawing their hand from handle {{to the tip of}} the knife. This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream. Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities, such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from their targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in Scream 2, in regards to defeating two trained detectives single-handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving blunt trauma, stabbing wounds and gunshots. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior.|$|E
25|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing opened on December 11, 2006, with Reiser being represented by attorney William Du Bois. At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA {{had been found}} on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, {{where he had been}} living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed the blood on the pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive. Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece socket set which may have been used to remove the passenger seat, a receipt for the purchase of the socket set from Kragen Auto Parts, four seat bolts, and a ratchet wrench with a socket on it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently. A traffic officer who had pulled Reiser over nine days after Reiser's wife went missing testified later in the trial that the passenger seat had been present at the time, and that he had not seen <b>any</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle {{with a smile on}} his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find <b>any</b> <b>blood</b> on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E
