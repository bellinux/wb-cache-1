5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, <b>as</b> <b>where</b> a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, <b>as</b> <b>where</b> stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E

5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written <b>as</b> , <b>where</b> x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Vígríðr or Óskópnir {{is a large}} field foretold to host {{a battle}} between {{the forces of the}} gods and the forces of Surtr as part of the events of Ragnarök. The field is attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The Poetic Edda briefly mentions the field <b>as</b> <b>where</b> the two forces will battle, whereas the Prose Edda features a fuller account, foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn.|$|E

Financing income (e.g., interest, dividends) is generally treated <b>as</b> arising <b>where</b> the user of the financing resides.

5|$|In {{addition}} to meat or fur hunts, {{there are also}} competition hunts to demonstrate the speed and skill of the dog. In these the raccoons are not killed, but are treed and released. Some of the largest competition hunts are the Grand American, Autumn Oaks, and Leafy Oaks. Coon hunting has been recorded in such books <b>as</b> <b>Where</b> the Red Fern Grows and popularized in stories and songs recorded by Jerry Clower, Jimmy Martin and others. In Alabama, there is a cemetery specifically for the burial of coonhounds.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction <b>as</b> <b>where</b> it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such <b>as</b> <b>where</b> to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Willamette University {{purchased}} the old building from the YWCA. The $1.35 million purchase included the main YWCA building {{adjacent to the}} former library {{for a total of}} , with the YWCA continuing their operations in the building for three years after the sale. After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side <b>as</b> <b>where</b> the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor. Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical look and feel of the original 1912 building.|$|E
5|$|The mutants {{infiltrate}} Stryker's {{base and}} Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it <b>as</b> <b>where</b> {{he received his}} adamantium skeleton. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer {{roosting}} locations of this species, as well <b>as</b> <b>where</b> maternal colonies are formed, which makes a proper species distribution estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer roosting habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. They also found that females roosting sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than male’s roosts. Females who have young require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer roosting habitats are very difficult to find, and may be threatened by mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create roosting sites for the species.|$|E
