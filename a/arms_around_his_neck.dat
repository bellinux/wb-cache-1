2500|$|Gunnhild was {{the patron}} and lover of Hrut Herjolfsson (or Hrútur Herjólfsson), an Icelandic {{chieftain}} who visited Norway {{during the reign}} of Gunnhild's son Harald. This dalliance was all the more scandalous given the difference in their ages; the fact that Gunnhild was a generation older than Hrut was considered noteworthy. Gunnhild engaged in public displays of affection with Hrut that were normally reserved for married couples, such as putting her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> in an embrace.

2500|$|The {{grand duke}} was a lifelong bachelor, never {{involved}} in scandals. His cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich {{accused him of}} misogyny in his book of memoirs, but this was contradicted with the close affective relationships he had with female members of his family. He was adored by his family and especially by his young nieces and nephews, with whom he would happily play and ride for hours. [...] He was particularly close {{to the children of}} his brother Konstantin. His nephew Prince Gabriel Konstantinovich [...] remembered him, as a [...] "wonderful, kind person" [...] who was almost a second father and wherever they saw him, they ran across the room, jumping up to hug him and wrap their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Dmitry Konstantinovich also loved to tease the children and play practical jokes on them.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1919, Rheinschild {{was tried}} and {{found not guilty}} of {{complicity}} in an automobile theft; Rheinschild {{had been accused of}} hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person. [...] In September 1919, Rheinschild was suspended from the practice of law for 18 months after being accused of unethical conduct in representing both parties in a loan transaction. [...] The Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "tears of mortification" [...] came into his eyes when the suspension was announced, and [...] "his young and attractive wife ran up to him and threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and tenderly kissed him." [...] Two weeks later, the same judge reversed the suspension. [...] The following month, a different judge ordered Rheinschild disbarred, stating that the action was needed to set an example for other lawyers to restrain from similar conflicts of interest.|$|E

6000|$|He {{admitted}} {{that she might be}} right; still speaking absently, still thinking of the Divorce.

60|$|Since Upanqui {{had found}} his elder son again he began to dote upon him, as {{in such a case}} the old and weak-minded often do, and would walk about the gardens and palaces with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{babbling}} to him of whatever was uppermost in his mind.
