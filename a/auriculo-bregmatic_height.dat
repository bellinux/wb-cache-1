40|$|Cranial {{capacity}} {{was measured}} in Korean adult skulls. The cavity was filled with rice seeds and {{the volume of the}} seeds were measured in a graduated cylinder. The results were 1470 +/- 107 (mean +/- standard deviation) in male and 1317 +/- 117 cc in female skulls. These values were in good accordance with those previously reported. In addition, regression formulae were obtained with the product of the length, breadth, and height of the skull as an independent parameter and the measured capacity as a dependent one. With known external measurements, the expected cranial capacity was as follows: when using baso-bregmatic height, male: capacity = 307. 5 + 333 x 10 (- 6) x (length. breadth. baso-bregmatic height) female: capacity = - 12. 0 + 435 x 10 (- 6) x (length. breadth. baso-bregmatic height) and, when using <b>auriculo-bregmatic</b> <b>height,</b> male: capacity = 214. 6 + 429 x 10 (- 6) x (length. breadth. <b>auriculo-bregmatic</b> <b>height)</b> female: capacity = 131. 6 + 461 x 10 (- 6) x (length. breadth. <b>auriculo-bregmatic</b> <b>height)</b> ...|$|E
30|$|The {{conventional}} forensic method [45] {{is based}} on traditional morphometrics, where 22 estimation parameters are measured covering anatomical locations of 87 cranial samples (45 males and 42 females). These 87 samples are drawn the same dataset we obtained from the Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL). The measurements include the maximum cranial length, maximum cranial breadth, cranial base length, basion-bregma height, bizygomatic breadth, maximum frontal breadth, minimum frontal breadth, basion prosthion, upper facial height, nasal height, nasal breadth, orbital height of the right eye, orbital height of the left eye, orbital breadth of the right eye, orbital breadth of the left eye, biorbital breadth, <b>auriculo-bregmatic</b> <b>height</b> of the right side, <b>auriculo-bregmatic</b> <b>height</b> of the left side, naso-occipital length, mastoidal bregma height of the right side, mastoidal bregma height of the left side, and nasion bregma height. Through independent t test, the authors were able to deduce the difference {{between male and female}} categories. Discriminant function analysis(DFA) is then used to generate equations for modeling the measurements and regression analysis to classify the samples into their respective classes. The prediction result from the study obtained through cross-validation is between 78.2 and 86.2 %.|$|E
