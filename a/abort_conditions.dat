On the three unmanned flights, it was discovered that the Mercury-Redstone exhibited a roll transient of 8° per second versus 4° for the Redstone missile. Although this was below the 12° per second roll transient required to trigger an abort, the roll rate sensor was removed from the two manned flights to reduce the chances of an accidental abort (the booster still retained the roll attitude angle sensor which would be triggered at 10°).|$|R

My son William found the two sexes growing in about equal numbers in the Isle of Wight, and sent me specimens, {{together}} with observations on them. Each sex consists of two sub-forms. The two forms of the male differ in their pistils: in some plants it is quite small, without any distinct stigma; in others the pistil is much more developed, with the papillae on the stigmatic surfaces moderately large. The ovules in both kinds of males are in an <b>aborted</b> <b>condition.</b> On my mentioning this case to Professor Caspary, he examined several male plants in the botanic gardens at Konigsberg, {{where there were no}} females, and sent me the drawings in Figure 7.13.|$|R
40|$|The J- 2 X is an {{expendable}} {{liquid hydrogen}} (LH 2) /liquid oxygen (LOX) gas generator cycle rocket engine {{that is currently}} being designed as the primary upper stage propulsion element for the new NASA Ares vehicle family. The J- 2 X engine will contain abort logic that functions as an integral component of the Ares vehicle abort system. This system is responsible for detecting and responding to conditions indicative of impending Loss of Mission (LOM), Loss of Vehicle (LOV), and/or catastrophic Loss of Crew (LOC) failure events. As an earth orbit ascent phase engine, the J- 2 X is a high power density propulsion element with non-negligible risk of fast propagation rate failures that can quickly lead to LOM, LOV, and/or LOC events. Aggressive reliability requirements for manned Ares missions {{and the risk of}} fast propagating J- 2 X failures dictate the need for on-engine <b>abort</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring and autonomous response capability as well as traditional abort agents such as the vehicle computer, flight crew, and ground control not located on the engine. This paper describes the baseline J- 2 X abort subsystem concept of operations, as well as the development process for this subsystem. A strategy that leverages heritage system experience and responds to an evolving engine design as well as J- 2 X specific test data to support abort system development is described. The utilization of performance and failure simulation models to support abort system sensor selection, failure detectability and discrimination studies, decision threshold definition, and abort system performance verification and validation is outlined. The basis for abort false positive and false negative performance constraints is described. Development challenges associated with information shortfalls in the design cycle, <b>abort</b> <b>condition</b> coverage and response assessment, engine-vehicle interface definition, and abort system performance verification and validation are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Test {{objectives}} for this flight {{were concerned with}} {{the ability of the}} spacecraft to withstand reentry under the temperature-critical <b>abort</b> <b>conditions</b> and with the capability of the Atlas to meet the proper injection conditions. Convair had promised to deliver thicker-skinned Atlas vehicles for subsequent flights, however Missile 67D was the last of the thin-skinned model and so it had to be modified for the Mercury mission, incorporating a stainless steel reinforcing band installed around the vehicle between stations 502 and 510. A thin sheet of asbestos was installed between the reinforcing band and the tank skin. This modification was installed as a precaution against the type of failure which had occurred on the previous MA-1 flight. The booster's flight path was also modified somewhat from Mercury-Atlas 1, being placed on a more shallow trajectory so as to reduce aerodynamic loads.|$|E
50|$|The Vostok {{spacecraft}} utilized {{an ejector}} seat {{to bail out}} the cosmonaut {{in the event of}} a low-altitude launch failure, as well as during reentry, however it was likely ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy. Inspired by the Mercury LES, Soviet designers began work on a similar system in 1962. This included developing a complex sensing system to monitor various launch vehicle parameters and trigger an abort if a booster malfunction occurred. Based on data from R-7 launches over the years, engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down <b>abort</b> <b>conditions</b> to premature separation of a strap-on booster, low engine thrust, loss of combustion chamber pressure, or loss of booster guidance. The Spacecraft Abort System (SAS; Система Аварийного Спасения) could also be manually activated from the ground, but unlike American spacecraft, there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves.|$|E
5000|$|An {{accidental}} pad {{firing of}} a launch escape system {{occurred during the}} attempted launch of the unmanned Soyuz 7K-OK No.1 spacecraft on December 14, 1966. The vehicle's strap-on boosters did not ignite, preventing the rocket from leaving the pad. About 30 minutes later, while the vehicle was being secured, the LES engine fired. Separation charges started {{a fire in the}} rocket's third stage, leading to an explosion that killed multiple pad workers. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. Originally it was thought that the LES firing was triggered by a gantry arm that tilted the rocket past 7 degrees, meeting one of the defined in-flight <b>abort</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, a more thorough investigation found a different cause: the Earth's rotation caused the rate gyros to register an approximately 8° tilt, which the abort sensing system interpreted as the booster deviating from its flight path. The system was subsequently redesigned to prevent recurrence of this unanticipated error.|$|E

50|$|A {{common and}} {{normally}} harmless phenomenon on Atlas vehicles was {{the tendency of}} the booster to develop a slight roll {{in the first few}} seconds following liftoff due to the autopilot not kicking in yet. On a few flights however, the booster developed enough rolling motion to potentially trigger an <b>abort</b> <b>condition</b> {{if it had been a}} manned launch. Although some roll was naturally imparted by the Atlas's turbine exhaust, this could not account for the entire problem which instead had more to do with engine alignment. Acceptance data from the engine supplier (Rocketdyne) showed that a group of 81 engines had an average roll movement in the same direction of approximately the same magnitude as that experienced in flight. Although the acceptance test-stand and flight-experience data on individual engines did not correlate, it was determined that offsetting the alignment of the booster engines could counteract this roll motion and minimize the roll tendency at liftoff. After Schirra's Mercury flight did experience momentary roll problems early in the launch, the change was incorporated into Gordon Cooper's booster on MA-9.|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{preliminary}} design work being performed for the Orion vehicle, the Orion to Spacecraft Adaptor (SA) separation mechanism mechanism was analyzed and sized, with findings presented here. Sizing is based on worst case <b>abort</b> <b>condition</b> {{as a result of an}} anomaly driving the launch vehicle engine thrust vector control hard-over causing a severe vehicle pitch over. This worst case scenario occurs just before Upper Stage Main Engine Cut-Off (MECO) when the vehicle is the lightest and the damping effect due to propellant slosh has been reduced to a minimum. To address this scenario and others, two modeling approaches were invoked. The first approach was a detailed Simulink model to quickly assess the Service Module Engine nozzle to SA clearance for a given separation mechanism. The second approach involved the generation of an Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) model to assess secondary effects due to mass centers of gravity that were slightly off the vehicle centerline. It also captured any interference between the Solar Arrays and the Spacecraft Adapter. A comparison of modeling results and accuracy are discussed. Most notably, incorporating a larger SA flange diameter allowed for a natural separation of the Orion and its engine nozzle even at relatively large pitch rates minimizing the kickoff force. Advantages and disadvantages of the Simulink model vs. a full geometric ADAMS model are discussed as well...|$|R

When doing these analyses, many iterations are necessary until some convergence or <b>abort</b> <b>conditions</b> are met. It was also mentioned that manually implementing iterative programs by multiple MapReduce jobs utilizing a driver program can be problematic.

Introduction: Object of Investigation. - The cabbage plant, Brassica oleracea, presents {{us with a}} {{wider range}} of varieties than perhaps any other cultivated plant. There is no other of our garden vegetables which gives so many useful forms as it does. In the wild state it is found on the coasts of western Europe, and persons familiar only with the garden forms would, most likely, not recognize it. Seedlings of the wild plant grown in rich soil show great variations. Selection of these variations has resulted in a number of races, each with numerous varieties. At maturity these races differ very markedly in certain characters. It is not difficult to appreciate the difference between the green and the red cabbage with great single heads; Brussel-sprouts with numerous little heads; broccolis and cauliflowers with the greater number of their flowers in an <b>aborted</b> <b>condition,</b> incapable of producing seed and borne in a dense corymb instead of in an open panicle; Savoys with their blistered and wrinkled leaves; and borecoles and kales which come nearest to the wild parent form. Now the seeds of these races are uniform to a degree. Seen in mass some are a little lighter or darker, some are smaller or larger than usual, but in no case are there any distinguishable markings. As there are no distinguishable features in the seeds, the question we are concerned with is: How soon in the life history of the plants does differentiation begin...|$|R
60|$|There {{is another}} subject on which some light is thrown by the facts given in this volume, namely, hybridisation. It is notorious that when {{distinct}} {{species of plants}} are crossed, they produce with the rarest exceptions fewer seeds than the normal number. This unproductiveness varies in different species up to sterility so complete that not even an empty capsule is formed; and all experimentalists have found that it is much influenced by the conditions to which the crossed species are subjected. The pollen of each species is strongly prepotent over {{that of any other}} species, so that if a plant's own pollen is placed on the stigma some time after foreign pollen has been applied to it, any effect from the latter is quite obliterated. It is also notorious that not only the parent species, but the hybrids raised from them are more or less sterile; and that their pollen is often in a more or less <b>aborted</b> <b>condition.</b> The degree of sterility of various hybrids does not always strictly correspond with the degree of difficulty in uniting the parent forms. When hybrids are capable of breeding inter se, their descendants are more or less sterile, and they often become still more sterile in the later generations; but then close interbreeding has hitherto been practised in all such cases. The more sterile hybrids are sometimes much dwarfed in stature, and have a feeble constitution. Other facts could be given, but these will suffice for us. Naturalists formerly attributed all these results to the difference between species being fundamentally distinct from that between the varieties of the same species; and this is still the verdict of some naturalists.|$|R

RCC components used for orbiter nose cap and wing leading edge thermal protection were originally designed to have a multi-mission entry capability of 2800 F. Increased orbiter range capability required a predicted increase in excess of 3300 F. Three test series were conducted. Test series # 1 used ENKA-based RCC specimens coated with silicon carbide, treated with tetraethyl orthosilicate, sealed with Type A surface enhancement, and tested at 3000 - 3400 F with surface pressure of 60 - 101 psf.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{mission tasks}} assessments effort seeks {{to determine the}} physical performance requirements that astronauts must meet in order to safely and successfully accomplish lunar exploration missions. These assessments will determine astronaut preflight strength, fitness, and flexibility requirements, {{and the extent to}} which exercise and other countermeasures must prevent the physical deconditioning associated with prolonged weightlessness. The purpose is to determine the flexibility and strength that crewmembers must possess in order to reach Crew Exploration Vehicle controls during maneuvers that result in sustained acceleration levels ranging from 3. 7 G to 7. 8 G. An industry standard multibody dynamics application was used to create human models representing a 5 th percentile female, a 50 th percentile male, and a 95 th percentile male. The additional mass of a space suit sleeve was added to the reaching arm to account for the influence of the suit mass on the reaching effort. The human model was merged with computer models of a pilot seat and control panel for the Crew Exploration Vehicle. Three dimensional paths were created that guided the human models hand from a starting position alongside its thigh to three control targets: a joystick, a keyboard, and an overhead switch panel. The reaching motion to each target was repeated under four vehicle acceleration conditions: nominal ascent (3. 7 G), two ascent aborts (5. 5 G and 7. 8 G) and lunar reentry (4. 6 G). Elbow and shoulder joint angular excursions were analyzed to assess range of motion requirements. Mean and peak elbow and shoulder joint torques were determined and converted to equivalent resistive exercise loads to assess strength requirements. Angular excursions for the 50 th and 95 th percentile male models remained within joint range of motion limits. For the 5 th percentile female, both the elbow and the shoulder exceeded range of motion limits during the overhead reach. Elbow joint torques ranged from 10 N-m (nominal ascent) to 60 N-m (ascent abort). Shoulder joint torques ranged from 65 N-m (nominal ascent) to 280 N-m (ascent abort). Maximal equivalent exercise loads reached 30 lb in tricep extension, 9 lb in bicep curl, 110 lb in unilateral pullover and unilateral bench press for nominal conditions (lunar reentry), and 188 lb in unilateral pullover and unilateral bench press. The location of the pilot seat was found to be inadequately located to allow a 5 th percentile female to reach the switches on the overhead panel. Elbow strength requirements were found to be well within population norms. Shoulder strength was found to be a limiting factor. Reaching under nominal ascent and lunar reentry conditions was found to require near maximal shoulder strength. Reaching under ascent <b>abort</b> <b>conditions</b> requires shoulder strength well beyond population norms. Pilot seats must adjust to accomodate a 5 th percentile female. Exercise countermeasures must maintain maximal pullover and bench press strength to allow pilots to reach and operate controls during lunar reentry.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) is {{the only}} {{reusable}} large liquid rocket engine ever developed. The specific impulse delivered by the staged combustion cycle, substantially higher than previous rocket engines, minimized volume and weight for the integrated vehicle. The dual pre-burner configuration permitted precise mixture ratio and thrust control while the fully redundant controller and avionics provided a very high degree of system reliability and health diagnosis. The main engine controller design was the first rocket engine application to incorporate digital processing. The engine was required to operate at a high chamber pressure to minimize engine volume and weight. Power level throttling was required to minimize structural loads on the vehicle early in flight and acceleration levels on the crew late in ascent. Fatigue capability, strength, ease of assembly and disassembly, inspectability, and materials compatibility were all major considerations in achieving a fully reusable design. During the multi-decade program the design evolved substantially using a series of block upgrades. A number of materials and manufacturing challenges were encountered throughout SSME s history. Significant development was required for the final configuration of the high pressure turbopumps. Fracture control was implemented to assess life limits of critical materials and components. Survival in the hydrogen environment required assessment of hydrogen embrittlement. Instrumentation systems were a challenge due to the harsh thermal and dynamic environments within the engine. Extensive inspection procedures were developed to assess the engine components between flights. The Space Shuttle Main Engine achieved a remarkable flight performance record. All flights were successful with only one mission requiring an ascent <b>abort</b> <b>condition,</b> which still resulted in an acceptable orbit and mission. This was achieved in large part via extensive ground testing to fully characterize performance and to establish acceptable life limits.
