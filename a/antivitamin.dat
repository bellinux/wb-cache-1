40|$|Antivitamins {{represent}} a broad class of compounds that counteract the essential effects of vitamins. The symptoms triggered by such antinutritional factors {{resemble those of}} vitamin deficiencies, but can be successfully reversed by treating patients with the intact vitamin.

40|$|The soybean {{is known}} as an {{excellent}} source of protein when formulating diets for swine. However, this potential can be achieved only if certain quantity of heat is applied. Osborne and Mendel (1917) were the first to report that raw soybeans had a growth-depressing effect in rats. Generally, these heat labile factors are protease inhibitors, lectins, goigotrens and <b>antivitamins.</b> The most common way of eliminating these factors is by heating or “toasting” the soybeans in a processing plant, being sure that temperature, duration of the heating, particle size and moisture are controlled. Another way to inactivate these factors is by dry extrusion (without steam). It is well known that antinutritional factors present in raw soybeans can cause inhibition in growth, decreased feed efficiency, goiterogenic responses, pancreatic hypertrophy, hypoglycemia and liver damage in non ruminants animals depending upon species, age, size, sex, state of health and plane of nutrition.

30|$|As a {{plant protein}} source, SBM {{is widely used}} as a partial or {{complete}} substitute for animal protein (Hertrampf and Pascual 2000). Several nutritionists have investigated the feasibility of SBM in aquafeeds, {{and the results are}} contradictory, because the levels of SBM that can be used without causing growth reduction are highly species-specific and influenced by culture systems (Yue et al. 2012). For instance, Markey (2007) reported that 58 % of SBM is being used in grow out culture of whiteleg shrimp. Lim and Dominy (1990) demonstrated that 40 % level of a marine mixed protein could be replaced by solvent extracted SBM, whereas higher levels exerted reduced growth performance of L. vannamei. It was also reported that 80 % FM could be replaced by co-extruded soybean and poultry by-product meal supplemented with egg in indoor recirculating water system (Davis and Arnold 2000). Likewise, other researchers suggested different inclusion levels of FM in the diet of whiteleg shrimp culture in different conditions (Samocha et al. 2004 a; Browdy et al. 2006; Patnaik et al. 2006; Amaya et al. 2007). This is while in marine shrimp diets, higher levels of dietary SBM usually resulted in lower growth (Akiyama 1990; Floreto et al. 2000). Likewise, Yue et al. (2012) suggested that FM inclusion can be reduced to approximately 200  g kg− 1 diet of whiteleg shrimp when SBM and peanut meal are included instead. Reduced growth performance and increased FCR in L. vannamei fed different diets that gradually replace FM by SBM could be because of anti-nutritional factors, such as saponins, phytoestrogens, allergens, phytate (myo-inositol- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexakisphosphate), protease inhibitors, trypsin inhibitors, lectins and <b>antivitamins</b> (Francis et al. 2001). For example, trypsin inhibitors and lectins prevent the proper activity of digestive enzymes (Gemede and Ratta 2014). The other limitation in application of SBM in fish diet is the improper amino acid composition that does not meet the nutritional requirements of fish (Floreto et al. 2000). In addition, n- 3 lipid composition of SBM is much lower comparing to FM, and thus high inclusion levels of SBM in the diet may result in reduced growth performance (Sharawya et al. 2016).|$|R

The optimum balance of the benefits and the risks of oral anticoagulant therapy is based on the frequency as well as the consequences of the risk of recurrent VTE and anticoagulant-related bleeding.

40|$|A forty-six-year old {{in-patient}} {{was treated}} with heparin for massive pulmonary embolism. During the hospitalization, the clinical evolution was unusual and characterised as follows: a) the extent of pulmonary embolism justified a thrombolysis by streptokinase; b) an acute thrombocytopenia occurred a few days later, preceded by a slower, but significant decrease of platelet count; c) a non-occlusive aortic thrombosis developed, distal to renal arteries, causing distal embolisation, successfully treated by local fibrinolysis. The prompt correction of platelet count after interruption of heparin therapy confirmed the diagnosis, before the detection of antibodies against heparin-PF 4 complexes. Heparin was immediately replaced by another direct anticoagulant, recombinant hirudin (lepirudine-Refludan), initially given alone and progressively replaced by an <b>antivitamin</b> K (Sintrom).

40|$|Vitamin B 12 (cyanocobalamin, CNCbl) is an {{essential}} cofactor-precursor for two biochemical reactions in humans. When ingested, cobalamins (Cbl) are transported via a multistep transport system into the bloodstream, where the soluble protein transcobalamin (TC) binds Cbl and the complex is taken up into the cells via receptor mediated endocytosis. Crystal structures of TC in complex with CNCbl have been solved previously. However, the initial steps of holo-TC assembly have remained elusive. Here, we present four crystal structures of the beta domain of human TC (TC-beta) in different substrate-bound states. These include the apo and CNCbl-bound states, providing insight into the early steps of holo-TC assembly. We found that in vitro assembly of TC-alpha and TC-beta to a complex was Cbl-dependent. We also determined the structure of TC-beta in complex with cobinamide (Cbi), an alternative substrate, shedding light on the specificity of TC. We finally determined the structure of TC-beta in complex with an inhibitory <b>antivitamin</b> B 12 (anti-B 12).

40|$|Oxythiamin {{is one of}} the <b>antivitamin</b> {{derivatives}} of thiamin which, after phosphorylation, can {{be bound}} to the catalytic centre of thiamin-dependent enzymes and inhibit these enzymes. In this work the influence of oxythiamin on the growth rate, survival and the activity of pyruvate decarboxylase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (s 288 c) was investigated. Oxythiamin decreased both the growth rate and survival ability of yeast cells. Moreover, in three-day-old cultures on a medium with oxythiamin, an increase of pyruvate decarboxylase activity was observed. This unusual effect may be in response to the earlier inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylase. A high concentration of pyruvate in the cell extracts taken from the medium with oxythiamin was found. This accumulation of pyruvate could provide for enhanced biosynthesis of the pyruvate decarboxylase apoform and an increase of enzyme activity. Modification of the metabolism of yeast cells could be accomplished by use of coenzyme or anticoenzyme vitamin derivatives (SHELLENBERGER 1998). Thiamin is a precursor of thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) which plays the role of a prosthetic group in important enzymes of many metabolic processes, for example in alcoholic fermentation – pyruvate decarboxylase, aerobic oxidation – pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pentose phosphate cycle – transketolase (HÜBNER et al. 1998, SPRENGER and POHL 1999) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Antivitamin</b> K {{anticoagulant}} (AVK) rodenticides {{are commonly}} used to control rodent pests worldwide. They specifically inhibit the VKORC 1 enzyme essential for the recycling of vitamin K, and thus prevent blood clotting and cause death by haemorrhage. Numerous mutations or polymorphisms of the Vkorc 1 gene were reported in rodents, and some led to resistance to rodenticides. In house mice (Mus musculus domesticus), adaptive introgression of the Vkorc 1 gene from the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus) was reported. This adaptive introgression causes the substitution of four amino acids in M. musculus domesticus. RESULTS: The consequences of introgression were assessed by (i) the characterisation of the in vivo resistant phenotype of adaptive Vkorc 1 spr-introgressed mice, (ii) the characterisation of the ex vivo resistance phenotype of the liver VKOR activity and (iii) the comparison of these results with the properties of recombinant VKORC 1 spr protein expressed in yeast. The resistance factor (from 1 to 120) induced by the four introgressed polymorphisms obtained using these three approaches was dependent on the AVKs used but were highly correlated among the three approaches. CONCLUSION: The four introgressed polymorphisms were clearly {{the cause of the}} strong resistant phenotype observed in the field. In the context of strong selection pressure due to the extensive use of AVKs, this resistant phenotype may explain the widespread distribution of this genotype from Spain to Germany...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{duration}} of anticoagulation after venous thromboembolism (VTE) is determined {{according to the}} risk of recurrent VTE after stopping anticoagulant therapy and the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding while on <b>antivitamin</b> K. Clinical risk factors appears to be determinant to predict the risk of recurrence whereas the influence of biochemical and morphological tests is uncertain. The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism is low when the initial episode was provoked by a reversible major risk factor (surgery) : 3 months of anticoagulation is optimal. Conversely, this risk is high when venous thromboembolism was unprovoked or associated with persistent risk factor (cancer) : 6 months or more prolonged anticoagulation is warranted. After this first estimation, the {{duration of}} anticoagulation may be modulated according to the presence of additional minor risk factors (major thrombophilia, chronic pulmonary hypertension, massive pulmonary embolism) : 6 months if VTE was provoked and 12 to 24 months if VTE was unprovoked. If the risk of anticoagulant related bleeding is high, the duration of anticoagulation should be shortened (3 months if VTE was provoked and 6 or 3 months if it was unprovoked). Lastly, if VTE occurred in the setting of a cancer, anticoagulation should be conducted for 6 months or more while cancer is active or on ongoing treatment. Despite an increasing knowledge of the risk factors of recurrent VTE, a number of issues remain unresolved; randomised trial comparing different duration of anticoagulation are needed...|$|E

In spite of its high nutritive value, linseed has not been effectively exploited in animal feeding, {{due to the fact that}} it contains antinutritive components, which are cyanogenic glycosides (CG) and <b>antivitamin</b> B 6 (linatine). CGs are a major limitation in application of linseed and its meal in animal nutrition. The objective of the study was to investigate effect of microwave heat treatment on the content of hydrogen cyanide, and consequently cyanogenic glycosides in linseed. Operating frequency of microwave oven was 2450 mHz, and working power was 240 W, 400 W, 560 W and 800 W. Samples were treated for 0, 3, 6 and 10 minutes for every working power. When microwave power of 560 W and 800 W was used for 6 min and longer, linseed samples were burned and damaged, therefore these treatments should not be used. Minimal time of heating with microwave power of 400 W, which would provide reduction of HCN content under allowed limits (250 mg/kg of linseed), was determined graphically using three-dimensional contour plot graph and it was 290 s (4 minutes and 50 s). This regime is recommended for treating linseed before usage as a feed compound...|$|E
40|$|Anticoagulant rodenticides are {{commonly}} used to control rodent pests worldwide. They specifically inhibit the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC 1), which is an enzyme encoded by the Vkorc 1 gene, involved in the recycling of vitamin K. Therefore, they prevent blood clotting. Numerous mutations of Vkorc 1 gene were reported in rodents, and some {{are involved in the}} resistant to rodenticides phenotype. Two hundred and sixty-six mice tails were received from 65 different locations in France. Coding sequences of Vkorc 1 gene were sequenced in order to detect mutations. Consequences of the observed mutations were evaluated by the use of recombinant VKORC 1. More than 70 % of mice presented Vkorc 1 mutations. Among these mice, 80 % were homozygous. Contrary to brown rats for which only one predominant Vkorc 1 genotype was found in France, nine missense single mutations and four double mutations were observed in house mice. The single mutations lead to resistance to first-generation <b>antivitamin</b> K (AVKs) only and are certainly {{associated with the use of}} these first-generation molecules by nonprofessionals for the control of mice populations. The double mutations, probably obtained by genetic recombination, lead to in vitro resistance to all AVKs. They must be regarded as an adaptive evolution to the current use of second-generation AVKs. The intensive use of first-generation anticoagulants probably allowed the selection of a high diversity of mutations, which makes possible the genetic recombination and consequently provokes the emergence of the more resistant mutated Vkorc 1 described to date...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{systematic}} use of <b>antivitamin</b> K anticoagulants (AVK) as rodenticides {{caused the}} selection of rats resistant to AVKs. The resistance is mainly associated to genetic polymorphisms in the Vkorc 1 gene encoding the VKORC 1 enzyme responsible for the reduction of vitamin K 2, 3 -epoxide to vitamin K. Five major mutations, which are responsible for AVK resistance, have been described. Possible explanations for the biological cost of these mutations have been suggested. This biological cost might be linked {{to an increase in}} the vitamin K requirements. To analyze the possible involvement of VKORC 1 in this biological cost, rVKORC 1 and its major mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris as membrane-bound proteins and their catalytic properties were determined for vitamin K and 3 -OH-vitamin K production. In this report, we showed that mutations at Leu- 120 and Tyr- 139 dramatically affect the vitamin K epoxide reductase activity. Moreover, this study allowed the detection of an additional production of 3 -hydroxyvitamin K for all the mutants in position 139. This result suggests the involvement of Tyr- 139 residue in the second half-step of the catalytic mechanism corresponding to the dehydration of vitamin K epoxide. As a consequence, the biological cost observed in Y 139 C and Y 139 S resistant rat strains is at least partially explained by the catalytic properties of the mutated VKORC 1 involving a loss of vitamin K from the vitamin K cycle through the formation of 3 -hydroxyvitamin K and a very low catalytic efficiency of the VKOR activity...|$|E
40|$|Penicillamine is {{a potent}} oral {{chelating}} agent that {{is used in the}} treatment of Wilson's disease and certain heavy metal intoxications (1, 2). It is currently under study in primary macroglobu-linemia, the cold agglutinin syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and cystinuria (3 - 6). It has been well established that L-penicillamine exerts an anti-vitamin B 6 effect in the rat (7, 8). This is mani-fest by growth depression, excessive urinary ex-cretion of xanthurenic acid after a tryptophane load, and a reduced activity of the pyridoxine-de-pendent alanine-glutamic (G. P. T.) and aspartic-glutamic (G. O. T.) transaminases. All of these effects were reversed by the simultaneous adminis-tration of vitamin B 6. D-Penicillamine was not growth inhibitory in the rat, hence it has been be-lieved to be devoid of antipyridoxine activity (9). L-Penicillamine forms a thiazolidine compound with pyridoxal 5 -phosphate (10). Since pyri-doxal 5 -phosphate is the coenzyme of kynureninase (11), its inactivation by L-penicillamine would re-sult in an impairment in the metabolism of tryp-tophane via the kynurenine pathway (7). Re-cent studies, however, indicate that D-penicillamine also forms a thiazolidine with pyridoxal 5 -phos-phate (12); hence it too might be expected to have <b>antivitamin</b> B 6 effects. The increased urinary excretion of the inter-mediary metabolites of tryptophane (xanthurenic acid and kynurenine) that occurs in patients treated with isoniazid has led to the concept that that drug is a metabolic antagonist of vitamin B, (13). The co-administration of this vitamin with isoniazid has favorably influenced certain of the toxic manifestations of the drug without impairing its efficacy (14).
