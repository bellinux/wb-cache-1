5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and <b>autobus</b> services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E

25|$|A six-man {{breakaway}} formed {{out of a}} {{group that}} at first numbered 27. That 27-man group featured race leader Michael Rasmussen and his King of the Mountains rival Mauricio Soler. The six who went forward attained a maximum advantage before the Saunier Duval and Rabobank squads set to reeling them in. Their pace proved fast enough that the <b>autobus</b> formed almost immediately as the peloton started the ascent up the Port de Pailhères.|$|E

The railway was {{operated by the}} Compagnie des chemins de fer départementaux du Finistère until 1936, then by the Régie départementale des chemins de fer et <b>autobus</b> du Finistère until 28 February 1939 and finally by the Société générale de chemins de fer économique from 1941 to 1946.

Hushovd won his second stage of the Tour with the sixteenth; he formed part of the three-rider breakaway that escaped with [...] to go. On the descent of the final climb– the Col de Manse– Evans attacked and at the finish had gained time on his rivals, displacing Fränk Schleck and moving up one place to second overall. Another descent to the finish followed in the next stage, and again the winner came from a breakaway. Boasson Hagen was the victor, improving on his second place the previous day. Overall race leader Voeckler lost 27 seconds to his rivals after he went wide {{on two of the}} final descent's corners. The Tour's queen stage, the eighteenth, included three hors catégorie climbs, including the Col du Galibier to the finish at Serre Chevalier. With [...] to go, Andy Schleck launched a solo attack on the second climb, the Col d'Izoard. He went on to bridge across and pass a large breakaway, before claiming the stage win; he moved up to second overall, gaining over two minutes on his rivals. Voeckler's lead in the yellow jersey was reduced to fifteen seconds. The <b>autobus</b> (the large group behind the leading peloton) of 88 riders finished outside the time limit, 35 min 50 s after Schleck; all riders were allowed to stay in the race due the large number. The points classification leader, Cavendish, who was in the group, was docked 20 points.|$|E
