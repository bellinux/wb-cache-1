The system converts Portable Document Format (. pdf) to Machine Editable Word Document (. doc). It includes two parts; recognition and formatting. The recognition of Myanmar and English character {{can be done}} by MICR (Myanmar Intelligent Character Recognition) which is one kind of ICR. Statistical and semantic information is used in MICR. Final decision of is made by voting system. MICR has become successful in character recognition area recent years. MICR can produce character recognition with high accuracy rate and faster speed. Table classification is used for the recognition of table format. Hough Transformation is used to detect lines in table recognition. This system can perform not only paragraph format but also text format. Paragraph format includes <b>alignment</b> (<b>left,</b> <b>right</b> and center). Text format includes font color, font size and bold, etc. The system use image processing and Matlab programming...|$|E

Apart from those, there are many other document types that are valuable, too, but that do not have any se-curity features, as e. g. bills and vouchers. These may be used by fraudulent people to defraud money from e. g. a car insurance company. The wide availability of scanning and printing hardware allows even non-experts to easily forge a document. We therefore present a new aspect in the exam-ination of intrinsic document features for optical document security: the goal is to automatically detect text-lines that have been manipulated or additionally inserted in a doc-ument by inspecting their <b>alignment</b> (<b>left,</b> <b>right</b> or center) with respect to the other text-lines in the document. This constitutes an additional feature in the goal of developing a powerful toolbox for automatic document inspection. Us-ing the extracted text-lines, the alignment margins are ex-tracted. Statistics on the distances of the text-lines to the alignment margins are used to identify lines that might have been forged. Such documents can then be presented to a hu-man operator for further inspection. Due to lack of public datasets containing forged documents, a new dataset had to be created. Evaluation showed a classification accuracy o...|$|E

40|$|In the brain, the {{mechanisms}} {{of attention to the}} <b>left</b> and the <b>right</b> are known to be different. It is possible that brain activity when driving also differs with different horizontal road <b>alignments</b> (<b>left</b> or <b>right</b> curves), but little is known about this. We found driver brain activity to be different when driving on <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> curves, in an experiment using a large-scale driving simulator and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The participants were fifteen healthy adults. We created a course simulating an expressway, comprising straight line driving and gentle <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> curves, and monitored the participants under driving conditions, in which they drove at a constant speed of 100 km/h, and under non-driving conditions, in which they simply watched the screen (visual task). Changes in hemoglobin concentrations were monitored at 48 channels including the prefrontal cortex, the premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex and the parietal cortex. From orthogonal vectors of changes in deoxyhemoglobin and changes in oxyhemoglobin, we calculated changes in cerebral oxygen exchange, reflecting neural activity, and statistically compared the resulting values from the <b>right</b> and <b>left</b> curve sections. Under driving conditions, there were no sites where cerebral oxygen exchange increased significantly more during right curves than during left curves (p > 0. 05), but cerebral oxygen exchange increased significantly more during left curves (p < 0. 05) in the right premotor cortex, the right frontal eye field and the bilateral prefrontal cortex. Under non-driving conditions, increases were significantly greater during left curves (p < 0. 05) only in the right frontal eye field. Left curve driving was thus found to require more brain activity at multiple sites, suggesting that left curve driving may require more visual attention than right curve driving. The right frontal eye field was activated under both driving and non-driving conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} holding planned hand actions in working memory on the time taken to visually identify objects with handles. Features of the hand actions and position of the object's handle were congruent or incongruent on two dimensions: <b>alignment</b> (<b>left</b> vs. <b>right)</b> and orientation (horizontal vs. vertical). When an object was depicted in an upright view, subjects were slower to name it when its handle was congruent with the planned hand actions on one dimension but incongruent on the other, relative to when the object handle and actions were congruent on both or neither dimension. This pattern is consistent with many other experiments demonstrating that a cost occurs when there is partial feature overlap between a planned action and a perceived target. An opposite pattern of results was obtained when the depicted object appeared in a 90 -degree rotated view (e. g., a beer mug on its side), suggesting that the functional goal associated with the object (e. g., drinking from an upright beer mug) was taken into account during object perception and that this knowledge superseded {{the influence of the}} action afforded by the depicted view of the object. These results have implications for the relationship between object perception and action representations, and for the mechanisms that support the identification of rotated objects...|$|R

30|$|More precisely, {{this paper}} is divided into 15 sections. In Section  2, we define very general fuzzy spaces (X,M_C;A,∗) called fuzzy quasi-triangular spaces. In Section  3, we {{introduce}} the notions of the <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> M_C;A-convergence, M_C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> G-sequentially completeness, and M_C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> W-sequential completeness in (X,M_C;A,∗). In Sections  4 and 5, we define <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> G-families and W-families K_C;A generated by M_C;A, which generalize M_C;A, and next we define <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> K_C;A-convergence, K_C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> G-sequential completeness, and K_C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> W-sequential completeness in (X,M_C;A,∗); in particular, if K_C;A=M_C;A, then Section  5 reduces to Section  3. In Section  6, using families K_C;A, we introduce the notions of <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> fuzzy sets of Pompeiu-Hausdorff type on 2 ^X× 2 ^X× (0;∞), and using these fuzzy sets, we construct <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> set-valued T:X→ 2 ^X and single-valued T:X→ X fuzzy contractions. In Section  7, we define K_C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> G-admissible and K _C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> W-admissible set-valued T:X→ 2 ^X and single-valued T:X→ X dynamic systems; this notions generalize in some sense the notions of K_C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> G-sequential completeness and K_C;A <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> W-sequential completeness in (X,M_C;A,∗) presented in Section  5. Section  8 of the paper {{is devoted to the}} <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> M_C;A-closed set-valued T:X→ 2 ^X and single-valued T:X→ X dynamic systems. Section  9 includes a convergence, approximation, and periodic point of Nadler-type result with its proof. This result concerns <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> dynamic systems T:X→ 2 ^X in (X,M_C;A,∗) with <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> G-families and <b>left</b> (<b>right)</b> W-families K_C;A generated by M_C;A.

Important relations between fuzzy quasi-triangular spaces and quasi-triangular spaces {{are to be found in}} Section  11. In Section  12, some fuzzy quasi-triangular spaces are constructed. The examples given in Sections  13 and 14 illustrate the fact that the results obtained here are different from those well known in the literature. Section  15 concerns some conclusions.|$|R
