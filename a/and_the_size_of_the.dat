This tax more influences <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> construction government than <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> current one. Indeed, contrary to developed countries, collecting value added tax mostly influences the ratio of construction expenditures to GDP rather than influencing reduced poverty through increasing welfare expenditure, which increase government current expenditures...|$|R

5|$|The first {{detection}} of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers.

Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.|$|E

The organism was clearly a competent swimmer, propelling itself with the 'flippers' attached to its head, and using its wing-like lobes on the 11th segment to steer. These lobes presumably derived from the lateral lobes of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used lobes along their sides to swim, and lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of {{stagnation}} that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 were side shows. The Games in Paris did not have a stadium, but were notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the United States. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement. The Games rebounded when the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens. These Games were, but are not now, officially recognised by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, {{pushing through the}} bunker system from the north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than {{the front of the}} assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E

5|$|Phase II: As {{the extent}} of the territories falling under Roman control {{expanded}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forces increased, the soldiery gradually became salaried professionals. As a consequence, military service at the lower (non-salaried) levels became progressively longer-term. Roman military units of the period were largely homogeneous and highly regulated. The army consisted of units of citizen infantry known as legions (Latin: legiones) as well as non-legionary allied troops known as auxilia. The latter were most commonly called upon to provide light infantry, logistical, or cavalry support.|$|E
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E
