40|$|Abstract. Because {{it is very}} {{important}} to study the coal pillar stability, a lot of methods to do this have been proposed. But most of those methods do not consider the nature of coal material and only study the coal pillar that is level. To solve this problem suitably, here a new method is proposed. In this method, the plastic softening nature of coal material is considered. And also, the coal seam pitch is considered in our analysis. Based on real deformation of coal pillar and the previous study, the limiting equilibrium method is applied. At last, the rationality of our method is verified through a strip mining engineering example. And the results show that, the computing results of our method <b>are</b> <b>coincided</b> with measuring results very well and our method can be applied in real engineering practice very well...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{demands for}} {{transporting}} {{oil and natural}} gas promote the developing and production of high-grade pipeline steel. The hot rolling is a vital process to produce the steel plate of pipe fabrication. In a hot rolling line, a flying shear is used to shear the leading and trailing edges of a rough rolled plate. In the present research, three-dimensional FE model of flying shear was built on ABAQUS/Explicit, considering the motions of blades. The feeding rollers and shear blades are considered as rigid material, and the steel plate adopts elastic-plastic material model. Ductile damage criterion for X 100 steel was built to simulate the material damage and fracture during the shear processing. By the simulation, the plastic deformation, the damage initiation and evolution, the fracture of steel plate can be obtained, which <b>are</b> <b>coincided</b> to production practise. The stroke-force curves of blades were generated from the FE simulation. The shearing force varying with the blade stroke was analyzed.
