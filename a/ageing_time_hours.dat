40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} <b>ageing</b> temperature, <b>time</b> and cooling medium on the {{microstructure}} and hardness {{of a solution}} treated Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy were investigated. The furnace cooling after ageing for 0. 5 hours gave a homogenous structure with higher hardness values than the solution treated and water quenched Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. Increasing the <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> to 2 <b>hours</b> reduced the alloy hardness. Ageing at temperatures between 500 and 700 0 C, followed by furnace cooling, led to homogenously distributed α- and β-phases within a fully martensitic matrix leading to improved hardness. A heterogeneous structure with a high variation in microhardness was revealed when ageing at 80...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{modification}} of the carbide type, size, shape and the associated changes in the toughness properties after prolonged aging at temperatures close to that of maximum hardening during tempering treatment. The aging effects on the microstructure of both steels still consist of a tempered martensite matrix, with an increased amount of precipitates and more market prior austenitic grain boundaries. For H 13 steel, the aging effects on fracture toughness show an appreciable increase in up to 50 hours’ treatment; raising the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> to 250 <b>hours</b> causes considerable embrittlement. For H 11 steel however, the fracture toughness decreases early, from the first stages of aging; this behaviour has been associated {{to an increase in}} the carbide size. At increasing <b>aging</b> <b>time,</b> also for H 11 steel, the embrittlement of prior austenite grain boundaries prevails in controlling fracture initiation and in decreasing fracture toughness...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} diets composed by cottonseed hull and meat aging on carcass characteristics and meat quality from young bulls fed on a high-concentrate system. Thirty crossbred bulls were assigned in a complete randomized experimental factorial design with three diets (CH 21 : cottonseed hull 210 g kg- 1 on a DM basis, CH 27 : cottonseed hull 270 g kg- 1 on a DM basis and CH 33 : cottonseed hull 330 g kg- 1 on a DM basis) and different <b>aging</b> <b>times</b> (24 <b>hours</b> and 3, 7 and 14 days). Meat from CH 27 diets presented smaller LM moisture content (p < 0. 05). Total lipids were smaller in CH 33 diet (p < 0. 05). At 24 hours, CH 21 diet presented smaller LM cooking loss than other diets. The increasing <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> reduced the shear force (p < 0. 001) on the LM. Meat from CH 27 diet presented the highest luminosity (p < 0. 05) and yellowness values (p < 0. 001). Three or seven aging days presented smaller values of LM luminosity. Likewise, the increasing <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> presented greater (p < 0. 05) yellowness within the LM. Lipid oxidation was lower from CH 21 diet (p < 0. 001). The fatty acid composition on LM was similar among diets. The use of cottonseed hull could be useful strategies to improve the meat quality and lean beef production. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{precipitation}} and crystallization {{of aluminum}} (oxy) hydroxides from chloride solutions by neutralization {{appears to be}} quite complex and depends on several parameters, namely, temperature, the OH/Al molar ratio, aging and solution composition. The precipitation of aluminum from AlC 13 solutions {{was found to be}} complete at substoichiometric OH/Al ratios (typically ~ 2. 7), and resulted in the production of an amorphous material that transformed to crystalline phases upon aging at OH/Al ≥ 3. The predominant phases precipitated from 0. 5 M AlCl 3 solutions at 22, 60 and 95 ° C at an OH/Al ratio of 3 after 24 hours of aging were pseudoboehmite, bayerite and boehmite, respectively. Increasing the OH/Al ratio and <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> at both 22 °C and 60 °C promoted crystallization of bayerite over poorly crystalline boehmite. At 95 °C, regardless of <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> or degree of neutralization, boehmite was consistently obtained. Increasing the AlCl 3 concentration to 2. 0 M proved to suppress the crystallization of bayerite at 22 °C and 60 °C, and favoured the crystallization of pseudoboehmite instead. Between the bayerite and pseudoboehmite products, the former exhibited the best settling behaviour (30 % settled slurry density after 1 week), while settling did not occur at all for the latter. Precipitates produced from mixed AlCl 3 -NaCl solutions exhibited an increasing tendency to form pseudoboehmite over bayerite with increasing sodium chloride concentration. Upon neutralizing mixed AlCl 3 -MgCl 2 systems, the final solution pH decreased significantly with increasing magnesium chloride concentration. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of MgCl 2 promoted the precipitation of poorly crystalline mixed magnesium-aluminum-hydroxide hydrates, identified as Mg 6 Al 2 (OH) 18 · 4. 5 H 2 O by XRD. Increases in temperature (up to 125 °C), <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> (48 <b>hours)</b> and OH/Al ratio (3. 45) were unsuccessful in improving the crystallinity or transformation of these precipitates...|$|R
40|$|The {{isothermal}} aging {{behavior of}} a cold-rolled precipitation hardening stainless steel has been studied at 723  K (450  °C) for holding times up to 72  hours. The precipitation hardening has been investigated using microhardness Vickers (Hv), thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements, and tensile testing. Microhardness compared to TEP measurements is more sensitive to detect {{the initial stages of}} aging. Two precipitation regimes have been observed: the first one related to the formation of Cu-clusters for <b>aging</b> <b>times</b> below 1 <b>hour</b> and a second one associated with formation of Ni-rich precipitates. The results show that the material exhibits an outstanding continuous age strengthening response over the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> investigated, reaching a hardness of 710 ± 4  H and an ultimate tensile strength (σ) of 2. 65 ± 0. 02  GPa after 72  hours. Engineering stress-plastic strain curves reveal that the strength increases and the ductility decreases as the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> increases. However, after prolonged holding times (24 – 72 hours) and, although small, a rise in both the strength and the total elongation is observed. The precipitation kinetics can be well predicted over the entire range of <b>aging</b> <b>times</b> by the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation. Finally, a reliable linear hardness-yield strength correlation has been found, which enables a rapid evaluation of the strength from bulk hardness measurements.

40|$|We {{will now}} {{summarize}} the conclusions from parts I, II and III of this study. A test procedure {{has been developed}} that provides a simple, quick, and nondestructive means of monitoring the in vitro growth of S mutans {{in the presence of}} amalgams and alloys. The spectrophotometric readings are related in a simple way to growth expressed as dry weight of bacteria and metabolic products. Results are expressed as growth relative to controls which represent bacteria growing under identical conditions but not in contact with metals. The %RA 60 value that represents growth after 60 hours relative to controls is used as a measure of growth in the presence of alloys or amalgams. Spherical, fine cut, and dispersion alloys were studied as well as amalgams prepared from these alloys. The dispersion alloy inhibits growth less than the spherical alloy which in turn inhibits growth less than the fine cut alloy. The results for amalgams prepared from the alloys are reversed. At an <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> of two <b>hours,</b> dispersion alloy amalgams inhibit growth more than spherical alloy amalgams and fine cut alloy amalgams. <b>Aging</b> <b>time</b> of amalgams greatly influences the growth inhibition. Immediately after trituration growth is inhibited, but this inhibition is lost with aging. Different types of amalgams seem to lose growth inhibition at different rates. Hg composition in the range of 48 to 52 % seems to have little effect on growth inhibition. It remains for clinical studies, which are concerned with the incidence of secondary caries associated with amalgams, to demonstrate that the age and nature of the amalgam are significant...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of an effective ceramic conversion treatment of TIMETAL LCB (Ti- 6. 8 Mo- 4. 5 Fe- 1. 5 Al) has been investigated. Various characterisation methods were used to analyse samples {{in order to identify}} the best process conditions including SEM, EDX, XRD, GDS, micro-indentation and scratch testing. A solution treatment temperature of 850 °C was used as this is the appropriate temperature for the mechanism of solution treatment according to the β-transus temperature of this alloy. The results show that a solution treatment of 0. 5 hours produces an acceptable thickness of oxygen hardened case, an almost equal hardness to that of a longer treatment and a far better oxide layer, than a longer treatment time did, in terms of adherence to the substrate. An aging temperature of 500 °C was found to be the best as a lower temperature than this produced too thin an oxide layer and a higher temperature meant the oxide layer became exceedingly brittle. An <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> of 8 <b>hours</b> was found to be best as this gave good hardness, good performance in both static and dynamic loading and good wear resistance. The wear testing results show that the tribological properties of the TIMETAL LCB alloy have been significantly enhanced by the new ceramic conversion treatment specifically developed for beta alloys.

40|$|ABSTRACT In this paper, we {{investigated}} effects of aging at 473 K {{on the relationship}} between microstructure {{in the vicinity of the}} grain boundaries and fatigue strength for Al- 1. 2 %Si alloy. Results obtained show the following features. (1) As <b>aging</b> <b>time,</b> tA increase, the tensile strength (σB) and 0. 2 % proof stress (σ 0. 2) increase slowly, but gradually decrease after reaching a maximum at around 18 ks. On the other hand, fracture elongation shows an opposite trend, suggesting that at <b>aging</b> <b>times</b> above 18 ks, over aging occurs. (2) The fatigue strength lowers with increasing <b>aging</b> <b>time,</b> however, when the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> is more than 18 ks at 473 K, the fatigue strength remains almost the same. (3) When the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> is more than 6 ks, grain boundary precipitates with a size greater than several 10 s of nm are observed. (4) When the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> is 18 ks, an accumulation of dislocations are observed at the grain boundaries and in the vicinity of grain boundary precipitates, and dislocations increase with the number of stress cycles. (5) When the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> is more than 6 ks, the fatigue fracture surface is mainly intergranular. These results suggest that reduction of fatigue strength results from propagation of micro-cracks which are initiated at the large precipitates on the grain boundaries. 1...|$|R
