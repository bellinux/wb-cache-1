5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually <b>all</b> <b>processes</b> within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E

25|$|A Business Process Management {{system is}} quite {{different}} from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation {{on the back of a}} BPM implementation. The actual tools to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools, as described above. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are inextricably linked – the BPM implementation provides an architecture for <b>all</b> <b>processes</b> in the business to be mapped, but this in itself delays the automation of individual processes and so benefits may be lost in the meantime.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} was working with the caloric theory, Sadi Carnot in 1824 {{suggested}} that some of the caloric available for generating useful work is lost in any real process. In March 1851, while grappling {{to come to terms with}} the work of James Prescott Joule, Lord Kelvin started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in <b>all</b> <b>processes.</b> The idea was framed even more dramatically by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the heat death of the universe.|$|E
25|$|<b>All</b> <b>processes</b> in organisms obey {{physical}} laws, {{the difference}} from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave out a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{historians have}} begun to study the {{documentary}} records of the Inquisition. The archives of the Suprema, today held by the National Historical Archive of Spain (Archivo Histórico Nacional), conserves the annual relations of <b>all</b> <b>processes</b> between 1540 and 1700. This material provides information on about 44,674 judgements, the latter studied by Gustav Henningsen and Jaime Contreras. These 44,674 cases include 826 executions in persona and 778 in effigie. This material, however, {{is far from being}} complete—for example, the tribunal of Cuenca is entirely omitted, because no relaciones de causas from this tribunal have been found, and significant gaps concern some other tribunals (e.g., Valladolid). Many more cases not reported to the Suprema are known from the other sources (i.e., no relaciones de causas from Cuenca have been found, but its original records have been preserved), but were not included in Contreras-Henningsen's statistics for the methodological reasons. William Monter estimates 1000 executions between 1530 and 1630 and 250 between 1630 and 1730.|$|E

500|$|It is {{important}} to stress that, for each observer, there are no observable changes {{of the flow of}} time for events or processes that are at rest in his or her reference frame. [...] Five-minute-eggs as timed by each observer's clock have the same consistency; as one year passes on each clock, each observer ages by that amount; each clock, in short, is in perfect agreement with <b>all</b> <b>processes</b> happening in its immediate vicinity. [...] It is only when the clocks are compared between separate observers that one can notice that time runs more slowly for the lower observer than for the higher. [...] This effect is minute, but it too has been confirmed experimentally in multiple experiments, as described below.|$|E

2500|$|The total {{electric}} charge of an isolated system remains constant regardless of changes {{within the system}} itself. This law is inherent to <b>all</b> <b>processes</b> known to physics and can be derived in a local form from gauge invariance of the wave function. The conservation of charge results in the charge-current continuity equation. More generally, the net change in charge density ρ within a volume of integration V {{is equal to the}} area integral over the current density J through the closed surface S = ∂V, which is in turn equal to the net current I: ...|$|E

This is because the probabilities of transition cannot be affected by {{the presence or absence of}} other excited atoms. Detailed balance (valid only at equilibrium) requires that the change in time of the number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{principle}} can be restated as follows: almost <b>all</b> <b>processes</b> {{that are}} not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience randomness and complexity: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of [...] "heat," [...] but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the [...] "normal science" [...] of the NKS paradigm.|$|E
