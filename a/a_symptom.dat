5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer.

Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E

5|$|The ICD-10 {{criteria}} are typically used in European countries, while the DSM {{criteria are}} used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first-rank symptoms. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as <b>a</b> <b>symptom.</b>|$|E

According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E

40|$|Background: The cost {{effectiveness}} of hepatitis A prevention is typically assessed by comparing vaccination costs {{with the number}} of life-years saved. This endpoint does not consider the benefits of preventing nonfatal yet symptomatic infections. Nearly as many days of healthy life are lost to hepatitis A morbidity as mortality. Objective: To investigate the value American adults place on preventing hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>symptoms</b> by using the willingness-to-pay and time trade-off metrics. Methods: We provided a written description of hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>symptoms</b> to 181 American adults, who judged the amounts of money and lifespan they would forego to avoid them. The description made no reference to the possibility of fatality, and respondents were asked not to consider costs of medical care and work loss. We investigated relationships between demographic characteristics and each metric, {{the relationship between the two}} metrics, and the test/re-test reliability of the metrics. Results: Respondents would pay a median of $US 2000 (inter-quartile range, $US 500 to 5000; 2001 values) for risk-free prevention of hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Alternatively, they would forego a median of 28 days survival (inter-quartile range, 6 to 40 days) for cost-free prevention.

5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe.

Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area.

It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg.

5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
