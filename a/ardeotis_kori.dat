50|$|The {{kori bustard}} (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> {{is the largest}} flying bird native to Africa. It {{is a member of}} the bustard family, which all belong to the order Otidiformes and are {{restricted}} in distribution to the Old World. It is one of the four species (ranging from Africa to India to Australia) in the large-bodied Ardeotis genus. In fact, the male kori bustard may be the heaviest living animal capable of flight.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori</b> struthiunculus - the [...] "Somali kori" [...] {{distributed}} in Ethiopia, Uganda, South Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania. The two races {{are separated by}} the miombo woodlands of central Africa. This race has a more boldly patterned head and slightly more black and white patterning on the wings. The two races are similar in size, though A. k. struthiunculus may be slightly larger. This may be a distinct species.|$|E
5000|$|Some the {{prominent}} bird species {{reported by the}} website of University of Michigan Museum of Zoology are; common swift (Apus apus), kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori),</b> grey crowned crane (Balearica regulorum), pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius), South African galago (Galago moholi), Nycteris grandis, martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus), Swynnertonia swynnertoni and black-rumped buttonquail (Turnix nanus). One-third of the worldâ€™s eagle species are reported from the Matobo National Park. Buff-spotted flufftail and stripe-cheeked bulbuls are seen across the country. The bateleur eagle is {{the only member of}} the genus Terathopius and probably the origin of the [...] "Zimbabwe Bird", the national emblem of Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori),</b> Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
50|$|Bustards are all {{fairly large}} {{with the two}} largest species, the kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> and the great bustard (Otis tarda), being {{frequently}} cited as the world's heaviest flying birds. In both the largest species, large males exceed a weight of 20 kg, weigh around 13.5 kg on average and can attain a total length of 150 cm. The smallest species is the little brown bustard (Eupodotis humilis), which is around 40 cm long and weighs around 600 g on average. In most bustards, males are substantially larger than females, often about 30% longer and sometimes {{more than twice the}} weight. They are among the most sexually dimorphic groups of birds. In only the floricans is the sexual dimorphism reverse, with the adult female being slightly larger and heavier than the male.|$|E
50|$|The general {{limit for}} weight in flying birds is at about 25 kg, the {{exceptional}} Argentavis magnificens with {{its size and}} weight of a good-sized adult human notwithstanding as it evolved under unusual ecological conditions. Large males of the kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> and great bustard (Otis tarda) are perfectly capable of flight, while weighing in excess of 20 kg. A wing loading of c. 25 kg/m2 is the known limit for bird flight under normal circumstances; thus, a case could be made for Eremopezus to have been capable of flight. Paleontologists do not consider this likely however, due to the stoutness of the bones, which in such a degree is only known from birds that were certainly flightless. The secretarybird's tarsometatarsus, for example, is only some 20% shorter but more than 60% slimmer than that of E. eocaenus. Thus, its wings and arm bones were probably reduced, a process known to have taken as little as 10,000 years in some island rails.|$|E
50|$|The huge {{adult male}} great bustard is {{possibly}} the heaviest living flying animal. It is also {{arguably the most}} sexual dimorphic extant bird species, {{in terms of the}} size difference between males and females. Going on mass, the only known bird with a higher dimorphism is the green peafowl (Pavo muticus) as the males are apparently near four times as heavy as the female. Among both bustards and all living birds, the upper reported mass of this species is rivaled by that of the kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori),</b> which, due to its relatively longer tarsi and tail, is both longer and taller on average and is less sexually dimorphic. In terms of weight ranges reported, the great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) also only lags slightly behind these species. A male is typically 90 - 105 cm tall, with a length of around 115 cm and has a 2.1 - 2.7 m wingspan. The male can range in weight from 5.8 to 18 kg. Average male weights as reported have been fairly variable: in Russia, males weighed a median of 9.2 kg; in Spain, males weighed a mean of 9.82 kg during breeding season and 10.62 kg during non-breeding; in Germany, males weighed a mean of 11.97 kg; and the Guinness World Records has indicated that prior to their extirpation male bustards in Great Britain weighed an average of 13.5 kg. In a study in Spain, one male weighed as much as 19 kg. The heaviest verified specimen, collected in Manchuria, was about 21 kg. Larger specimens have been reported but remain unverified.|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori),</b> although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
5000|$|Trumpeter swans often mate for life, {{and both}} parents {{participate}} in raising their young, but primarily the female incubates the eggs. Most pair bonds are formed when swans are 5 to 7 years old, although some pairs do not form {{until they are}} nearly 20 years old. [...] "Divorces" [...] have been known between birds, {{in which case the}} mates will be serially monogamous, with mates in differing breeding seasons. Occasionally, if his mate dies, a male trumpeter swan may not pair again {{for the rest of his}} life. Most egg laying occurs between late April and May. The female lays 3-12 eggs, with 4 to 6 being average, in a mound of plant material on a small island, a beaver or muskrat lodge, or a floating platform on a clump of emergent vegetation. The same location may be used for several years and both members of the pair help build the nest. The nest consists of a large, open bowl of grasses, sedges and various aquatic vegetation and have ranged in diameter from 1.2 to 3.6 m, the latter after repeated uses. The eggs average 73 mm wide, 113.5 mm long, and weigh about 320 g. The eggs are quite possibly the largest of any flying bird alive today, in comparison they are about 20% larger in dimensions and mass than those of an Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), which attains similar average adult weights, and more than twice as heavy as those of kori bustards (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori).</b> The incubation period is 32 to 37 days, handled mainly by the female, although occasionally by the male as well. The young are able to swim within two days and usually are capable of feeding themselves after, at most, two weeks. The fledging stage is reached at roughly 3 to 4 months. While nesting, trumpeter swans are territorial and harass other animals, including conspecifics, who enter the area of their nest.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the range}} and sizes of mammals {{included}} in their prey spectrum, birds taken by martial eagles may seem less impressive as a whole but the morphology of the martial eagle, including large wing surface areas, pronounced sexual dimorphism and relatively long toes, shows the speciesâ€™ partial adaptation to capture of avian prey. Birds are universally considered by biologists more difficult to capture than mammals of the same size. In all, more than 50 bird species {{have been identified as}} the prey of martial eagles. The most significant portion of the avian diet is comprised by medium-sized terrestrial upland birds such as guineafowl, spurfowl and bustards. In total more than a dozen species of the galliform order and the bustard family each have been identified as their prey. When attacking these ground-loving birds, which are understandably quite easily spooked and usually react to potential danger by flying off, martial eagles almost always try to take them on the ground much like they do mammalian prey. If the birds take flight, the hunting attempt will fail, although a hunting eagle may try to surprise the same birds again. In Niger, the most numerous prey species is apparently the 1.29 kg helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). Other guineafowl such as the vulturine (Acryllium vulturinum) and crested guineafowl (Guttera edouardi) are also readily taken elsewhere. Guineafowl and spurfowl were stated as the most numerous prey for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. In Tsavo East National Park, the 0.67 kg red-crested korhaan (Lophotis ruficrista), perhaps the smallest bustard the eagle hunts, is the most numerous prey taken, comprising about 39% of the prey remains. Medium sized bustards such as the 1.2 kg Hartlaub's bustard (Lissotis hartlaubii) and the 1.7 kg Karoo korhaan (Eupodotis vigorsii) were oft-taken supplemental prey in Tsavo East and the Cape Province, respectively. Although these are not usually taken in large numbers, martial eagles are one of the main predators of larger bustards. These may include (averaged between the extremely size dimorphic sexes) the 3.44 kg Ludwig's bustard (Neotis ludwigii), the 5.07 kg Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and even the Kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori),</b> seemingly the heaviest bustard in the world on average at 8.43 kg. Attacks on adult male Kori bustards, which are certain to be the largest avian prey attacked by martial eagles and are twice as heavy as females, averaging some 11.1 kg, can be extremely prolonged. One protracted battle resulted in an injured leg for the eagle and massive, fatal blood loss for the male bustard, which was ultimately scavenged by a jackal by the following morning.|$|E
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests many widely distributed low-density tropical species are declining, but whether protected {{areas and the}} increasingly promoted multi-use community-managed wildlife areas mitigate causal threats is poorly studied. Lack of monitoring data and poorly understood species ecology limit knowledge of patterns, causal mechanisms and degree of abundance or range declines. Working in an African savanna, where bushmeat hunting and cattle-grazing are considered the greatest threats to wildlife, this thesis combined three approaches to study the conservation ecology of widely distributed wildlife at three spatial scales (continent-wide; landscape; home range). The continent-wide conservation status of Kori Bustard <b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori</b> was assessed by reviewing occurrence records (1863 â€“ 2009) across its range (14 countries). Range contraction was quantified by examining the proportion of historical records (pre- 1970) falling within the area delineated by recent records (1970 â€“ 2009), finding 8...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{increase}} understanding of the size and composition of eggs from two subspecies of houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii and C. u. undulata). Eggs from the rufous-crested bustard (Eupodotis ruficrista) and kori bustard (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> were also examined for comparison. Infertile eggs were collected from captive birds; egg mass and linear dimensions were recorded, and egg component masses were determined wet and dry. Significant differences were observed {{in the composition of}} the eggs from the two houbara subspecies. Despite being smaller in size, eggs from the macqueenii subspecies had a relatively larger yolk (and relatively less albumen) than eggs from the undulata subspecies. The relative composition of the rufous-crested and kori bustard eggs showed patterns {{similar to that of the}} undulata eggs. For the houbara bustards, changes in initial egg mass (IEM) were associated with changes in egg length more than egg breadth, and changes in egg length and breadth appeared to be due more to increases in albumen mass than to increases in yolk mass...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathologic findings of pediatric conditions that developed in four species of bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista, <b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori,</b> Chlamydotis undulata, and Eupodotis senegalensis) {{during the first}} 180 days after hatching are reviewed. The study surveyed 137 chicks reared at the National Avian Research Center in the United Arab Emirates between 1993 and 1995. The mortality rate of chicks decreased from 71 to 25 % between 1993 and 1995. This decrease was associated with modifications to {{the management of the}} chicks and the rearing environment. Musculoskeletal conditions were the most important cause of morbidity over the first 30 days (50 %) and, in total, over 180 days (49 %). Bacterial diseases were the most important cause of death over the first 30 days (62 %) and, in total, over 180 days (40 %). Eighty-two percent of the bacterial isolates from {{clinical and}} postmortem cases were gram-negative bacteria. Mechanical abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract were an important cause of death (16 %) and morbidity (4 %), in total, over 180 days. Forty-five percent and 52 % of all chick morbidity and mortality, respectively, occurred within the first 30 days after hatching. Aggressive care of bustards during the first 30 days after hatching is important. Health recommendations for bustard chicks are summarized...|$|E
40|$|A {{review was}} {{conducted}} of 236 postmortem examinations of six species of captive and imported bustards in the United Arab Emirates {{for the period}} 1979 - 94. The most common causes of death in adult imported houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) were euthanasia due to Newcastle disease, aspergillosis, and post-transportation-related deaths. Helminth parasites were a common finding in imported houbara bustards, and large parasite burdens occasionally caused intestinal obstruction and death. The most common causes of death in adult captive houbara bustards were trauma- related deaths and euthanasia for or death following treatment for capture myopathy. Fatty liver change was an important postmortem finding of captive adult houbara bustards. The main {{cause of death in}} juvenile houbara bustards was yolk-sac infection and septicemia. The most common causes of death in adult kori bustards (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> were capture myopathy and handling injuries or euthanasia following these injuries. The most common causes of death in adult rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista) were post- transportation deaths in imported birds and trichomoniasis and trauma in captive birds. Juvenile rufous crested bustards appeared to be highly susceptible to gizzard impactions and foreign-body obstructions of the gastrointestinal tract. Nutritional hone disease is an important disease of all juvenile bustards, particularly kori and houbara bustards. Aspergillosis was also a common postmortem finding in captive and imported adult houbara bustards and also caused mortality in juvenile kori and houbara bustards...|$|E
40|$|Bustards {{are large}} {{terrestrial}} birds that inhabit open plains, deserts, and dry bush country. The helminth parasites of captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueeni), rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista), and kori bustards (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> {{have been investigated}} at the National Avian Research Centre (NARC) and the International Institute of Parasitology. The cestode species recovered include Hispaniolepis falsata, Ascometra vestita, Ascometra choriotidis, Otiditaenia conoideis, Otiditaenia macqueeni, Raillietina neyrai, and Idiogenes sp. The acanthocephalans Mediorhynchus taeniatus and Centrorhynchus lancea were also recovered. A host-parasite list is presented here. Chlamydotis undulata macqueeni is a new host for A. choriotidis, C. lancea, and R. neyrai, and E. ruficrista is a new host for O. macqueeni. Ascometra choriotidis, R. neyrai, O. macqueeni, H. falsata, M. taeniatus, and C. lancea records are new for the United Arab Emirates. Cestodes were recovered from 18 of 78 houbara bustards, two of three kori bustards, and four of 10 rufous-crested bustards. Pathologic findings in the intestinal tract associated with cestode infection included inflammation, mild atrophy, collapse, and fibrosis of the intestinal mucosa. In some birds, the number of parasites was sufficient to partially obstruct the intestinal lumen. Administration of a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg praziquantel was effective in treating kori bustards known to be infected with the cestode O. conoideis.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the gross {{anatomy of the}} alimentary tract of Houbara Bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii), Kori Bustards (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori),</b> Rufous-crested Bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista) and White-bellied Bustards (Eupodotis senegalensis) maintained in captivity by the National Avian Research Center in the United Arab Emirates. The morphology of the alimentary tract and the proportions of each region were similar in all 4 species. The length of the oesophagus, combined proventriculus and ventriculus, small intestine, and large intestine formed 24. 2 - 28. 4 %, 7. 3 - 9. 7 %, 40. 5 - 55. 1 % and 9. 1 - 14. 7 % of the total alimentary tract length respectively. Neither crop nor oesophageal enlargement was observed in the birds {{examined in this study}}, although male Kori Bustards possessed a saccus oralis in the oropharyngeal cavity. Oesophagi, proventriculi, ventriculi, caeca and large intestine were well developed in all species. The small intestine was shorter than that of other avian herbivores and granivores when compared on a bodyweight basis. The well differentiated stomachs and well developed caeca of the bustards examined in this study are characteristic of omnivores. Analysis of the mean lengths of the alimentary tract components and weight of the liver and pancreas showed sexual dimorphism in cases where male and female data were available for direct comparison...|$|E
40|$|The {{avifauna}} of lowland Ethiopia {{consisting of}} grassland and bushland was investigated {{during the dry}} season from November 1981 to February 1982 in Omo National Park. One hundred and thirty-eight species of 48 families were observed in the whole area of the Park. One hundred and seven of these species were observed in the bushland around a small river and 45 species in the grassland and a small swamp. In the bushland area, dominant species were Turtur chalcospilos, Lamprotornis purpuropterus, Pycnonotus barbatus, Streptoperia decipiens, S. capicola, Tockus jacksoni, Corythaixoides leucogaster, Dicrurus adsimilis, and Francolinus sephaena. In the vicinity of the river, Burhinus senegalensis, Butorides striatus, Megaceryle maxima and Ceryle rudis were commonly found. In the grassland area, Struthio camelus, <b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori,</b> some species of Bustards, Oenanthe sp. and Cisticola sp. were commonly found. At the swamp in the grassland, Hoplopterus spinosus and Himantopus himantopus dominated. Comparing the savanna bushland with the grassland, the number of species and the density of birds in the former were three to five times and about thirty times respectively as many as those in the latter. In the savanna bushland, frugivores (19. 5 % of total number of species) accounted for 43. 4 % of total observed individuals and graminivores were next. In the grassland, number and density of species of insectivores were considerably higher than species with other food habits...|$|E
40|$|Aim With the {{exception}} of South Africa there are no systematic, long-term, large-scale bird monitoring programmes in Africa, and {{for much of the}} continent the most comprehensive available data for most species are incidental occurrence records. Can such data be used to assess range-wide conservation status of widespread low-density species? We examine this using Kori Bustard <b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori,</b> a large, easily identifiable species with an extensive African range. Location Southern and East Africa, 14 countries. Methods A comprehensive and systematic review of published and unpublished sources provided 1948 unique locality records spanning the years 1863 â€“ 2009; these included 410 non-atlas records and 97 historical (pre- 1970) records. Range-size changes were examined by comparing minimum convex polygons to quantify Extent of Occurrence pre- and post- 1970, and by testing whether more historical records fell outside the recent (post- 1970) 95 % probability kernel than expected by chance. Additionally, qualitative evidence of changes in abundance was obtained from historical published accounts and contemporary assessments by in-country experts. Results Since the late 19 th century, range-size (measured as Extent of Occurrence) has contracted, by 21 % in East Africa and 8 % in southern Africa. There is strong qualitative evidence of considerable pre- and post- 1970 population declines in all range states, except Zambia (slight increase) and Angola (trend unclear). In some countries, declines occurred from the early 1900 s. Thus, while relatively modest change in range-size has occurred in over 100 years, numbers have greatly reduced throughout the speciesâ€™ range. Main conclusions Our methodology allowed objective appraisal of continentwide Kori status. Despite lacking quantitative population estimates and trends, and poor understanding of the speciesâ€™ autecology, common issues for many African species, incidental occurrence records can be used to assess range-wide changes in status. We recommend that this or similar approaches be applied to other widespread low-density species that probably also have rapidly declining populations despite apparently stable range extents...|$|E
40|$|The {{in-vitro}} {{activity of}} enrofloxacin against 117 strains of bacteria isolated from bustards was determined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 72 % of the Proteus spp., E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Klebsiella spp. (n = 61) and for 48 % of the Streptococci spp, and Staphylococci spp. (n = 31) {{were less than}} or equal to 0. 5 mu g/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 76 % of Pseudomonas spp. (n = 25) was {{less than or equal}} to 2 mu g/mL. Fourteen strains were resistant to concentrations greater than or equal to 128 mu g/mL. The elimination half-lives (t(1 / 2) elim beta) (mean +/- SEM) of 10 mg/kg enrofloxacin in eight houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) were 6. 80 +/- 0. 79, 6. 39 +/- 1. 49 and 5. 63 +/- 0. 54 h after oral (p. o.), intramuscular (i. m.) and intravenous (i. v.) administration, respectively. Enrofloxacin was rapidly absorbed from the bustard gastro-intestinal tract and maximum plasma concentrations of 1. 84 +/- 0. 16 mu g/mL were achieved after 0. 66 +/- 0. 05 h. Maximum plasma concentration after i. m. administration of 10 mg/kg was 2. 75 +/- 0. 11 mu g/mL at 1. 72 +/- 0. 19 h. Maximum plasma concentration after i. m, administration of 15 mg/kg in two birds was 4. 86 mu g/mL. Bioavailability was 97. 3 +/- 13. 7 % and 62. 7 +/- 11. 1 % after i. m. and oral administration, respectively. Plasma concentrations of enrofloxacin greater than or equal to 0. 5 mu g/mL were maintained for at least 12 h for all routes at 10 mg/kg and for 24 h after i. m. administration at 15 mg/kg. Plasma enrofloxacin concentrations were monitored during the first 3 days of treatment in five houbara bustards and kori bustards (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> with bacterial infections receiving a single daily i. m. injection of 10 mg/kg for 3 days. The mean plasma enrofloxacin concentrations in the clinical cases at: 27 and 51 h (3. 69 and 3. 86 mu g/mL) and at 48 h (0. 70 mu g/mL) were significantly higher compared with the 3 h and 24 h time intervals from clinically normal birds. The maximum plasma concentration (C-max) /MIC ratio was ranked i. v. (10 /mg/kg) > i. m. (15 mg/kg) > i. m. (10 mg/kg) > oral (10 mg/kg), but it was only higher than 8 : 1 for i. v and i. m. administrations of enrofloxacin at 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively, against a low MIC (0. 5 mu g/mL). A dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg repeated every 12 h, or 15 mg/kg repeated every 24 h, would be expected to give blood concentrations above 0. 5 mu g/mL and hence provide therapeutic response in the bustard against a wide range of bacterial infections...|$|E
40|$|For understudied species, more {{informed}} conservation planning and decision-making {{on both the}} local and landscape levels may be attained {{through the use of}} occupancy and abundance estimations. Here, we focus on two iconic bird species in eastern Botswana, kori bustards (<b>Ardeotis</b> <b>kori)</b> and helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). The overall goal of this project was to better understand the hierarchy of factors that influence occupancy (Ïˆ) and density of kori bustard and helmeted guineafowl populations within the Northern Tuli Game Reserve and how these factors may interact to affect landscape conservation and usage. We performed distance sampling for both species over two field seasons throughout the Northern Tuli Game Reserve, Botswana during June 2014 -July 2014 and May 2015 -July 2015. We found that kori bustard probability of occupancy was influenced by open canopies (Ïˆ 2014 open= 0. 373, SEÂ± 0. 086; Ïˆ 2015 open= 0. 392, SEÂ± 0. 061) when compared to closed canopies (Ïˆ 2014 closed= 0. 000, SEÂ± 0. 000; Ïˆ 2015 closed= 0. 000, SEÂ± 0. 000). Kori bustard densities were highest in 2014 in areas of sparse vegetation at higher elevations with 5. 02 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 04 â€“ 24. 2 individuals) and lowest in areas of dense vegetation at upper elevation with 0. 02 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 005 â€“ 0. 140 individuals). In 2015 highest densities were found in areas of sparse vegetation at lower elevations with 2. 20 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 73 â€“ 2. 80 individuals) and lowest in areas of sparse vegetation at upper elevations with 0. 130 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 071 â€“ 0. 239 individuals). Helmeted guineafowl occupancy was most influenced by dense vegetation (Ïˆ 2014 dense = 0. 800, SEÂ± 0. 103; Ïˆ 2015 dense = 0. 752, SEÂ± 0. 116) and closed canopy (Ïˆ 2014 closed= 0. 857, SEÂ± 0. 132; Ïˆ 2015 closed= 0. 755, SEÂ± 0. 181), with some influence by lower elevations (Ïˆ 2014 lower= 0. 514, SEÂ± 0. 084; Ïˆ 2015 lower= 0. 637, SEÂ± 0. 082) when compared to sparse vegetation (Ïˆ 2014 sparse= 0. 405, SEÂ± 0. 065; Ïˆ 2015 sparse= 0. 436, SEÂ± 0. 067), open canopy (Ïˆ 2014 open= 0. 448, SEÂ± 0. 061; Ïˆ 2015 open= 0. 477, SEÂ± 0. 064) and upper elevations (Ïˆ 2014 upper= 0. 462, SEÂ± 0. 082; Ïˆ 2015 upper= 0. 367, SEÂ± 0. 082). In 2014, helmeted guineafowl were found at highest densities in areas of sparse vegetation at lower elevations with 828 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 564 â€“ 1217 individuals) and lowest densities in areas of sparse vegetation at upper elevations 49. 1 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 30. 9 â€“ 78. 1 individuals). In 2015, helmeted guineafowl were found at highest densities in areas of dense vegetation at higher elevations with 2, 085 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 905 â€“ 4803) and at lowest densities in areas of sparse vegetation at upper elevations with 38. 9 individuals/km 2 (95 % confidence interval: 23. 81 â€“ 63. 81 individuals). By determining which habitat and landscape factors influence kori bustard and helmeted guineafowl density and occupancy {{we will be able to}} make {{more informed}} decisions to aid in the conservation of both species and species that utilize the same types of habitats and resources. We discuss how using these data for landscape conservation planning could have a positive impact on the future of the study site and surrounding area. Habitat-specific information may identify risks during landscape conservation planning within the range of the kori bustard and helmeted guineafowl. Advisors: John P. Carroll and Larkin A.
