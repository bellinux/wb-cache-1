5000|$|To relieve {{insurers}} and brokers of that tedious and time-consuming chore, many states now maintain [...] "export lists" [...] of risks {{that the state}} insurance commissioner has already identified as having no coverage available whatsoever from any <b>admitted</b> <b>insurer</b> in the state. In turn, brokers presented by clients with those risks can immediately [...] "export" [...] them to the out-of-state surplus market and apply directly to surplus line insurers without having to first document multiple attempts to present the risk to admitted insurers. [...] However, many states have refused to establish export lists, including Florida, Illinois, and Texas.|$|E
5000|$|SLIMPACT {{applies to}} all kinds of nonadmitted {{insurance}} and is not limited to property and casualty insurance. [...] SLIMPACT also establishes a uniform definition of “principal place of business”, but not “principal residence” as used in the definition of “home state.” [...] SLIMPACT does not provide for {{a situation in which the}} insured’s principal place of business or principal residence is located outside the United States or explain how the insured’s home state is to be determined when the policy is a group policy. [...] Nor does SLIMPACT address, with regard to tax collection and allocation, the situation in which there is a multi-state risk and the insurer is an <b>admitted</b> <b>insurer</b> in one or more states.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{artifact of}} the state-based insurance regulation {{system in the}} United States is the dichotomy between admitted and surplus insurers. Insurers in the U.S. may be [...] "admitted", meaning {{that they have been}} formally admitted to a state's insurance market by the state insurance commissioner, and are subject to various state laws governing organization, capitalization, policy forms, rate approvals, and claims handling. Or they may be [...] "surplus", meaning that they are nonadmitted in a particular state but are willing to write coverage there. Surplus line insurers are supposed to underwrite only very unusual or difficult-to-insure risks, to prevent them from undermining each state's ability to regulate its insurance market. Although experienced insurance brokers are well aware of what risks an <b>admitted</b> <b>insurer</b> will not accept, they must document a [...] "diligent effort" [...] at actually shopping around a risk to several admitted insurers (typically three, who will promptly reject it) before applying for coverage with a surplus line insurer.|$|E
50|$|One long-running {{issue with}} the surplus lines concept {{is that it makes}} less sense when applied to {{sophisticated}} insureds with many risks spread across multiple states. Congress enacted the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 in an attempt to clarify which state gets to regulate the sale of surplus lines insurance to such insureds, and to exempt certain elite categories of insurance purchasers from the normal requirement of a diligent effort to procure coverage from <b>admitted</b> <b>insurers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A surplus lines broker {{seeking to}} procure or place nonadmitted {{insurance}} {{in a state}} for an exempt commercial purchaser (“ECP”) {{is not required to}} satisfy any state requirement to a make a due diligence search to determine whether the full amount or type of insurance sought by the ECP may be obtained from <b>admitted</b> <b>insurers</b> if: (1) the broker procuring or placing the insurance has disclosed to the ECP that the insurance {{may or may not be}} available from the admitted market, which may provide greater protection with more regulatory oversight; and (2) the ECP has subsequently requested, in writing, that the broker procure or place the insurance with a nonadmitted insurer. [...] An “exempt commercial purchaser” is defined in to mean: any person purchasing commercial insurance that, at the time of placement, meets the following requirements: (A) the person employs or retains a qualified risk manager to negotiate insurance coverage; (B) the person has paid aggregate nationwide commercial property and casualty insurance premiums in excess of $100,000 in the immediately preceding 12 months; and(C)(i) the person meets at least 1 of the following criteria: (I) The person possesses a net worth in excess of $20,000,000, as such amount is adjusted pursuant to clause (ii); (II) the person generates annual revenues in excess of $50,000,000, as such amount is adjusted pursuant to clause (ii); (III) the person employs more than 500 full-time or full-time equivalent employees per individual insured or is a member of an affiliated group employing more than 1,000 employees in the aggregate; (IV) the person is a not-for-profit organization or public entity generating annual budgeted expenditures of at least $30,000,000, as such amount is adjusted pursuant to clause (ii); or (V) the person is a municipality with a population in excess of 50,000 persons.|$|R
50|$|Only the {{smallest}} insurers {{exist as a}} single corporation. Most major insurance companies actually exist as insurance groups. That is, they consist of holding companies which own several <b>admitted</b> and surplus <b>insurers</b> (and sometimes a few excess insurers and reinsurers as well). There are dramatic variations from one insurance group to the next {{in terms of how}} its various business functions are divided up among its subsidiaries or outsourced to third party corporations altogether. All major insurance groups in the U.S. that transact insurance in California maintain a publicly accessible list on their Web sites of the actual insurer entities within the group, as required by California Insurance Code Section 702.|$|R
