60|$|There was a long-legged {{young man}} with <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>empty</b> donkey-cart, {{standing}} near the Obelisk, in the Blackfriars Road, whose eye I caught as I was going by, and who, addressing me as 'Sixpenn'orth of bad ha'pence,' hoped 'I should know him agin to swear to'--in allusion, I have no doubt, to my staring at him. I stopped to assure him that I had not done so in bad manners, but uncertain whether he {{might or might not}} like a job.|$|R
60|$|It chanced, {{while he}} was {{lounging}} about in this moody state, that he stumbled upon a flight of stairs, dark, steep, and narrow, which he ascended without any thought about the matter, and so came into <b>a</b> <b>little</b> music-gallery, <b>empty</b> and deserted. From this elevated post, which commanded the whole hall, he amused himself in looking down upon the attendants who were clearing away the fragments of the feast very lazily, and drinking {{out of all the}} bottles and glasses with most commendable perseverance.|$|R

60|$|She stood quite still. Her {{eyes were}} still fixed seawards, but she was looking beyond the yacht, now, to the dim line where sky and sea seemed to meet.

If you marry this young man without knowing more of your own hearts than you can in such a little time, you may regret it dreadfully; you may find it turn out, after all, nothing but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>empty</b> passion; or again, if {{anything}} happens to him before you've had any real married life together, you'll have a much greater grief and sense of loss to put up with than if you simply stay engaged till after the war.

60|$|No {{signs of}} {{habitation}} were visible, {{but that the}} land might easily support human life was evidenced by the abundant bird and animal life of which the watchers on the Fuwalda's deck caught occasional glimpses, {{as well as by}} the shimmer of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> river which <b>emptied</b> into the harbor, insuring fresh water in plenitude.|$|R

[...] He looked wonderingly around--at {{the little}} table at his side, where a huge bowl of sweet-scented roses was {{surrounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>little</b> army of <b>empty</b> medicine bottles, at Margharita's pale, wan face, and at a couch drawn up to the bedside. [...] "And you have been nursing me all the time?" [...] he whispered.|$|R
60|$|Tibble muttered this to himself, unheeded by Ambrose, {{and then}} {{presently}} crossing the church-yard, where a grave was being filled up, with numerous idle children around it, he conducted the youth into <b>a</b> curious <b>little</b> chapel, <b>empty</b> now, {{but with the}} Host enthroned above the altar, and the trestles on which the bier had rested still standing in the narrow nave.|$|R
6000|$|So they started, {{and through}} side streets Lysbeth {{was led to}} a back {{entrance}} of the Gevangenhuis, which opened and closed behind her mysteriously, leaving her wondering whether she would ever pass that gate again. Within a man was waiting--she did not even notice what kind of man--who also said, [...] "Follow me, lady," [...] and led her through gloomy passages and various doors into <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>empty</b> chamber furnished with a table and two chairs. Presently {{the door opened and}} shut; then her whole being shrank and sickened as though beneath the breath of poison, for there before her, still the same, still handsome, although so marred by time and scars and evil, stood the man who had been her husband, Juan de Montalvo. But whatever she felt Lysbeth showed nothing of it in her face, which remained white and stern; moreover, even before she looked at him she was aware that he feared her more than she feared him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he explained, [...] "I {{consider}} that a man's brain originally is like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>empty</b> attic, {{and you have to}} stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled {{up with a lot of}} other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones." ...|$|E
60|$|But it is hard, as I say, {{to express}} all this, {{and it is}} painful as well to attempt it--painful because {{in the memory of}} {{vanished}} hours so filled with beauty the consciousness of present loss oppresses. Exquisite hours, enveloped in light and silence, to have known them once is to have always a terrible standard of enjoyment. Certain lovely mornings of May and June come back with an ineffaceable fairness. Venice isn't smothered in flowers at this season, in the manner of Florence and Rome; but the sea and sky themselves seem to blossom and rustle. The gondola waits at the wave-washed steps, and if you are wise you will take your place beside a discriminating companion. Such a companion in Venice should of course be of the sex that discriminates most finely. An intelligent woman who knows her Venice seems doubly intelligent, and it makes no woman's perceptions less keen to be aware that she can't help looking graceful as she is borne over the waves. The handsome Pasquale, with uplifted oar, awaits your command, knowing, in a general way, from observation of your habits, that your intention is to go to see a picture or two. It perhaps doesn't immensely matter what picture you choose: the whole affair is so charming. It is charming to wander through the light and shade of intricate canals, with perpetual architecture above you and perpetual fluidity beneath. It is charming to disembark at the polished steps of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>empty</b> campo--a sunny shabby square with an old well in the middle, an old church on one side and tall Venetian windows looking down. Sometimes the windows are tenantless; sometimes a lady in a faded dressing-gown leans vaguely on the sill. There is always an old man holding out his hat for coppers; there are always three or four small boys dodging possible umbrella-pokes while they precede you, in the manner of custodians, {{to the door of the}} church.|$|E

Similar to his brother's move to Lille, his parents accepted an offer from Lens with hopes that the training facilities in France would be better, here he met fellow Belgium player and future Chelsea teammate Charly Musonda.

60|$|I went, {{creeping}} back to {{our place}} by the chests for that purpose, and as I was coming away an idea struck me. We had not thought much of the diamonds for the last twenty-four hours or so; indeed, {{the very idea of}} diamonds was nauseous, seeing what they had entailed upon us; but, reflected I, I may as well pocket some in case we ever should get out of this ghastly hole. So I just put my fist into the first chest and filled all the available pockets of my old shooting-coat and trousers, topping up--this was a happy thought--with a few handfuls of big ones from the third chest. Also, by an afterthought, I stuffed Foulata's basket, which, except for one water-gourd and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> biltong, was <b>empty</b> now, with great quantities of the stones.|$|R

Those in the little boat, lying but fifty or sixty yards away, could hear every word that was spoken. First came a volley of angry exclamations of disappointment as the Spaniards found that they had been called from their beds only to capture <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>little</b> coaster. <b>As</b> Ned had expected, they speedily {{came to the conclusion that}} having been carelessly fastened up alongside the wharves, without any one being left in charge, she had drifted out with the tide.|$|R
5000|$|Freedom {{so far has}} a {{score of}} 58 out of 100 from Metacritic based on [...] "mixed or average reviews". Rolling Stone {{described}} Akon's third studio album as [...] "melodrama about love and love lost delivered in a hooting style over synth-swamped beats." [...] Dan LeRoy of The Hartford Courant gave a positive review to the album, stating, [...] "Akon's undeniable gift for hooks makes this an easy listen, and the ex-con posturing isn't missed." [...] The Boston Globe also stated, [...] "This tuneful, seemingly effortless set of sun-kissed pop reminds you why he's in so much demand." [...] 411mania gave the album a score of eight out of ten and said, [...] "This CD is great for the clubs and perhaps for driving down the road trying {{to find something to}} put in your cars, but the lyrics are your basic run-of-the-mill R&B song lyrics and leave you <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>empty.</b> The one thing I can say for Akon is that he has a pretty decent voice, he's got a great look, and he's got great promoters." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C-, stating, [...] "Akon's philosophy of liberty also includes the freedom to reuse nearly identical hooks for 13 songs straight." [...] musicOMH gave the album one star out of five and stated, [...] "Unfortunately, all this really means is an extra emphasis on weirdly pitched keyboard riffs and slightly dated sounding beats," [...] and also stated [...] "The album opens with its two best songs, which is never a good idea when there are twelve still to get through." [...] The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica described the track Holla Holla, featuring T-Pain, [...] "is the first of theirs (song) in which the student clearly bests the mentor." [...] Meanwhile, following the album's UK release, noted R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul stated: [...] "With his new album's expansive moods ranging from banging ghetto jams like 'I'm So Paid' and sexual, T-Pain-featuring 'Holla Holla', to uplifting universal anthems like the autobiographical title-track and reggae-infused 'Sunny Day', hopes are high this time round for 'Freedom' to even eclipse Akon's already-amazing past international success." ...|$|E

500|$|On race day California Chrome did {{not break}} boldly. Espinoza later {{explained}} something felt [...] "off" [...] and he held the horse back a bit {{instead of going to}} the lead. When asked to move to the front, the horse did not unleash his usual burst of speed. Immediately following the race, Espinoza said [...] "He was just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>empty</b> today". [...] Tonalist won the race, and California Chrome finished fourth in a dead heat with Wicked Strong. [...] Initial post-race analysts criticized Espinoza for not taking the horse to the front early on, but noticed that California Chrome had had some blood on his right front heel. After the race, review of photos taken at the start showed that the horse next to him, Matterhorn, moved too far to the left and stepped on California Chrome's heel as both horses broke from the gate. [...] As a result, California Chrome had run the race with a [...] "chunk" [...] of tissue taken out of his right front heel and a small cut on his tendon. The tendon injury was superficial, but the heel injury may have been a factor in his loss. [...] Sherman explained that he knew that something was not right when he saw the horse throw his head up in the homestretch, and speculated later that the sand and dirt of the racetrack caused pain in the open wound. [...] The following day, Sherman assured the press that both injuries would heal.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} were {{investigate}} the reproductive biology of the fish Leporinus copelandii, a specie at risk of extinction in the lower Paraíba do Sul River basin. During a period of 14 months, a total of 143 females of red-piau were captured, between Itaocara and Campos dos Goytacazes cities (RJ, Brazil). A histological study shows four stages of the oocyte development (I, II, III and IV) and five stages of the reproductive cycle of females: rest (1), initial maturation (2 A), intermediary (2 B), advanced (2 C) and spawned (4) were identified. The pattern of L. copelandii oocyte development suggests development type synchronous in two groups, characterizing total spawning. Spawned females were captured in November, two months after the peak of frequency of competent females for reproduction. Histologically, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> occurrence of <b>empty</b> follicles was observed in spawned females. The medium diameter of the type IV oocyte of the spawned females (1475. 1 ± 884. 3 mm) was significantly larger (Tukey, P < 0. 001; VC = 41. 73 %; n = 259) than advanced maturation females (1202. 6 ± 245. 3 mm), what allows suggesting that the study place probably doesn't represent the reproductive area of L. copelandii...|$|R
6000|$|... 18th.--If I had not resolved, {{after what}} {{happened}} yesterday, to look only at the cheerful side of things for the future, the events of to-day would have robbed me of all my courage, at the very outset of our troubles. First, there was the casting up of our bills, and the discovery, when the amount of them was balanced against all the money we have saved up, that we shall only have between three and four pounds left in the cash-box, after we have got out of debt. Then there was the sad necessity of writing letters in my husband's name to the rich people who were ready to employ him, telling them of the affliction that had overtaken him, and of the impossibility of his executing their orders for portraits {{for the next six}} months to come. And, lastly, there was the heart-breaking business for me to go through of giving our landlord warning, just as we had got comfortably settled in our new abode. If William could only have gone on with his work, we might have stopped in this town, and in these clean, comfortable lodgings for at least three or four months. We have never had the use of a nice empty garret before, for the children to play in; and I never met with any landlady so pleasant to deal with in the kitchen as the landlady here. And now we must leave all this comfort and happiness, and go--I hardly know where. William, in his bitterness, says to the workhouse; but that shall never be, if I have to go out to service to prevent it. The darkness is coming on, and we must save in candles, or I could write much more. Ah, me! what a day this has been. I have had but one pleasant moment since it began; and that was in the morning, when I set my little Emily to work on a bead purse for the kind doctor's daughter. My child, young as she is, is wonderfully neat-handed at stringing beads; and even <b>a</b> poor <b>little</b> <b>empty</b> purse as <b>a</b> token of our gratitude, is better than nothing at all.|$|R

Ever since the first settlement of the country about Portland, it has been known that an inflammable gas constantly issued from the fissures of a rock, which forms the bed of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brook that <b>empties</b> into Lake Erie, near the harbor, in such quantity as to be easily set on fire by applying a flame to it. This fountain of gas was known to the early settlers of the country by the name of the 'burning spring.’ No valuable use, however, was made of this gas until Mr. W. A. Hart, an ingenious gunsmith of the village of Fredonia, and some other young mechanics, five or six years ago, collected a quantity of similar gas from the rocky bed of Canadaway creek in a reservoir, and conveyed it from thence to all the principal stores, taverns, and shops in the said village, where it is still used instead of lamps." ...|$|R
