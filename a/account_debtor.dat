Accordingly, the receivable becomes the factor's asset, and the factor obtains the right to receive the payments made by the debtor for the invoice amount, and is free to pledge or exchange the receivable asset without unreasonable constraints or restrictions. Usually, the <b>account</b> <b>debtor</b> is notified of {{the sale of the}} receivable, and the factor bills the debtor and makes all collections; however, non-notification factoring, where the client (seller) collects the accounts sold to the factor, as agent of the factor, also occurs. The arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor. [...] If the factoring transfers the receivable [...] "without recourse", the factor (purchaser of the receivable) must bear the loss if the <b>account</b> <b>debtor</b> does not pay the invoice amount. If the factoring transfers the receivable [...] "with recourse", the factor has the right to collect the unpaid invoice amount from the transferor (seller). However, any merchandise returns that may diminish the invoice amount that is collectible from the accounts receivable are typically the responsibility of the seller, and the factor will typically hold back paying the seller for a portion of the receivable being sold (the [...] "factor's holdback receivable") in order to cover the merchandise returns associated with the factored receivables until the privilege to return the merchandise expires.|$|E

If approved, the business will be set up with a maximum credit line from which they can draw.

5000|$|Factoring is not {{the same}} as invoice {{discounting}} (which is called an assignment of accounts receivable in American accounting - as propagated by FASB within GAAP). Factoring is the sale of receivables, whereas invoice discounting ("assignment of accounts receivable" [...] in American accounting) is a borrowing that involves the use of the accounts receivable assets as collateral for the loan. However, in some other markets, such as the UK, invoice discounting is considered to be a form of factoring, involving the [...] "assignment of receivables", that is included in official factoring statistics. It is therefore also not considered to be borrowing in the UK. In the UK the arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor. In the UK, the main difference between factoring and invoice discounting is confidentiality. Scots law differs from that of the rest of the UK, in that notification to the <b>account</b> <b>debtor</b> is required for the assignment to take place.

Though they have different features corresponding to users’ varying needs (payments may be face-to-face, remote or recurring, for instance), non-cash payment schemes generally consist of an instrument that generates a payment order combined with the technical and organisational arrangements that enable this order to be processed. Putting these arrangements in place requires close co-operation between all participants of the payment «network», i. e., naturally, credit institutions that hold <b>accounts</b> for <b>debtors</b> and beneficiaries, and also their technical service providers.

6000|$|The {{first thing}} I would remark on this (and I believe your Lordships have rather gone before {{me in the}} remark) is, that Mr. Hastings came down to Calcutta on the 5th of February; that then, or a few days after, he calls to him his {{confidential}} and faithful friend, (not his official secretary, for he trusted none of his regular secretaries with these transactions,)--he calls him to help him to make out his accounts during his absence. You would imagine that at that time he trusted this man with his account. No such thing: he goes on with the accountant-general, accounting with him for money expended, without ever explaining to that accountant-general how that money came into his hands. Here, then, we have the accountant making out the account, and the person accounting. The accountant does not in any manner make an objection, and say, [...] "Here you are giving me an account by which it appears that you have expended money, but you have not told me where you received it: how shall I make out a fair <b>account</b> of <b>debtor</b> and creditor {{between you and the}} Company?" [...] He does no such thing. There lies a suspicion in his breast that Mr. Hastings must have taken some money in some irregular way, or he could not have made those payments. Mr. Larkins begins to suspect him. [...] "Where did you lose this bodkin?" [...] said one lady to another, upon a certain occasion. [...] "Pray, Madam, where did you find it?" [...] Mr. Hastings, at the very moment of his life when confidence was required, even when making up his accounts with his accountant, never told him one word of the matter. You see he had no confidence in Mr. Larkins. This makes out one of the propositions I want to impress upon your Lordships' minds, that no one man did he let into every part of his transactions: a material circumstance, which will help to lead your Lordships' judgment in forming your opinion upon many parts of this cause.|$|R

40|$|Japan {{is facing}} a sizable fiscal {{imbalance}} {{against a backdrop of}} weak trend growth and growing external imbalances in the world economy. This paper examines the possible impact of fiscal adjustment and productivity-enhancing structural reforms on the Japanese and world economies. Simulation results indicate that these could reduce substantially Japan''s fiscal imbalance with only limited spillovers {{to the rest of the}} world. Specifically, faster productivity growth would help lower Japan''s debt and limit the tendency of fiscal consolidation to increase the external surplus. In fact, very rapid productivity growth could potentially lead to a decline in Japan''s external surplus and thereby have a positive effect on global imbalance. The modest extent of the spillovers to the rest of the world reflect the small size of the shocks and the diminished size of Japan in the world economy.

40|$|The article {{contains}} historical and comparative {{analysis of the}} legal issues of four cases derived from the English, French Italian and German law. In reference to each of it an author is answering the question whether it deals with the breach of law or its abuse. The first case concerns an owner of the real property who by means of receiving an access to the flagstones {{beneath the surface of}} the ground is forced to create a system of drainage. This action makes a threat for the supplies of water for the whole town. The question arises: it is possible to demand in such situation to render the judicial prohibition of the drainage. The French case concerns on the other hand an owner of the real property who fenced his plot with the sixteen meters pales with the iron spikes on their tops. The question reads: does the neighbor who was flying with his balloon and teared its top may demand the damages and the removal of the fence. An Italian case handles then with the neighboring owners of the wall with the window. The question concerns the right of the one of them to build more than three meters wall which would totally block out the light. Whereas the German example concerns the suspicious creditor who distrained the <b>debtor’s</b> <b>accounts</b> in all twenty banks that operated in the town in order to absolutely indispose him to use any financial resources. It is required to ask a question whether such action is eligible according to the law at all...|$|R
