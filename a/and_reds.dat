5|$|A 800–1,000-strong Swedish Brigade, led by Hjalmar Frisell, {{took part}} in the battles of Tampere and those fought in the area south of the town. In February 1918, the Swedish Navy escorted the German naval squadron, {{transporting}} Finnish Jägers and German weapons, and allowed it to pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists did not aid the Finnish Reds but tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites <b>and</b> <b>Reds.</b> The weakness of Finland gave Sweden a chance to take-over geopolitically vital Finnish Åland islands, east of Stockholm, but the German army's Finland-operation stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career in 1991 {{when he was}} drafted by the San Diego Padres, and pitched for three major league teams during his career. As a rookie with San Diego in 1994 he finished fifth in the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award voting for the National League. Following the 1998 season, San Diego traded Hamilton to the Toronto Blue Jays. In 2001, after two seasons with the Blue Jays, he was released. Hamilton signed with the Cincinnati Reds shortly afterward. Hamilton had stints in training camps and the minor leagues {{with some of the}} Padres <b>and</b> <b>Reds</b> affiliates. In March 2005, two days after signing with the New York Mets, the team released him.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the two opposing armed forces, the Red and White Guards, imposed a state of dual power and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically the prelude to a civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland, and the first armed clashes between the Whites <b>and</b> <b>Reds</b> broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for weapons and an escalation towards civil war.|$|E

5|$|The {{birth of}} the yellow, green, <b>and</b> <b>red</b> tricolor {{occurred}} during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life {{to the idea of}} the tricolor was the French blue, white <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flag adopted after the French Revolution. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flag was a green, white <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flag used to represent Lithuania Minor.|$|R
5|$|Today, player–managers {{have become}} rare in baseball. Pete Rose {{is the most}} recent player–manager, serving from 1984 through 1986 with the Cincinnati Reds. Whereas some player–managers, such as Lou Boudreau, were {{full-time}} players as player–managers, by the time Rose became player–manager, he was a part-time player. Rose was trying to prolong his career to break the all-time hit record set by Ty Cobb, <b>and</b> <b>Reds</b> owner Marge Schott used this as a marketing ploy. Rose removed himself from the 40-man roster after the 1986 season {{to make room for}} Pat Pacillo, unofficially retiring as a player, but remained as the Reds manager until he was banned from baseball following the release of the Dowd Report in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Chariot {{racing in}} the Byzantine Empire also {{included}} the Roman racing clubs, which {{continued to play}} {{a prominent role in}} these public exhibitions. By this time, the Blues (Vénetoi) and the Greens (Prásinoi) had come to overshadow the other two factions of the Whites (Leukoí) <b>and</b> <b>Reds</b> (Roúsioi), while still maintaining the paired alliances, although these were now fixed as Blue and White vs. Green and Red. These circus factions were no longer the private businesses they were during the Roman Empire. Instead, the races began to be given regular, public funding, putting them under imperial control. Running the chariot races at public expense was probably a cost-cutting and labor-reducing measure, making it easier to channel the proper funds into the racing organizations. The Emperor himself belonged to one of the four factions, and supported the interests of either the Blues or the Greens.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders {{defeated}} the Sharks 36-8 in the qualifier round. For the semi-final the Crusaders {{had to cross}} the Indian Ocean to Cape Town to play the Stormers. Despite travelling 11,000km the Crusaders {{defeated the}} Stormers 29-10 in a convincing display. The Crusaders faced the Reds in the Final and yet more travel. The Crusaders <b>and</b> <b>Reds</b> were matched evenly at 13-13 after exchanging a try apiece and two penalty's. However, Will Genia scored a crucial try for the Reds in the 68th minute to help them to an 18–13 win. The Crusaders lost the final to the Queensland Reds at the Suncorp Stadium. Despite not winning the title in 2011, the trials the Crusaders overcame to even make the final, made this season one of the Crusaders finest.|$|E

5|$|The Highlander’s 2005 season {{started with}} only their second ever {{loss to the}} Blues at Carisbrook, a 3014 loss. Following this the side won six games consecutively, {{the first time the}} {{franchise}} had ever done so. They first defeated the Bulls 230, then the Sharks 437. They then won away against the Cats <b>and</b> <b>Reds.</b> They returned to Carisbrook and defeated the Brumbies 1918, and the following week won in Wellington {{for the first time with}} a 2616 win over the Hurricanes. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Thus three weeks from the end of the round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E
5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, <b>and</b> <b>reds</b> — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{were the}} NL champions in 1961, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was relieved that his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates <b>and</b> <b>Reds,</b> recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3record, a 3.92ERA, and one save in 43⅔innings pitched.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} flag of Colombia was adopted on November 26, 1861.

25|$|Copper {{goes through}} a natural {{oxidation}} process that forms a unique protective patina on the metal. The surface of the metal undergoes a series of color changes: from iridescent/salmon pinks to oranges <b>and</b> <b>reds</b> interspersed with brassy yellows, blues, greens and purples. As the oxide thickens, these colors are replaced by russet and chocolate browns, dull slate grays or blacks, and finally to a light-green or blue-green.|$|E

25|$|When Australia {{became one}} of the world's best sides in the 1980s, the team was largely drawn from the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds. The ACT Brumbies had become another strong {{province}} by the 1990s and joined the Super 12 competition with the Waratahs <b>and</b> <b>Reds</b> in 1996, playing against the top rugby provinces from New Zealand and South Africa.

25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of interleague play in 1997, the Indians have developed two rivalries with National League (NL) teams, the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, both members of the National League Central. Until 2002, the Indians only played teams from the NL Central in interleague play. The format was changed in 2002 to have the divisions rotate. Since 2003, the Indians <b>and</b> <b>Reds</b> are designated rivals, meaning they play every season regardless of what division is scheduled to play the AL Central that year. The Pirates are not designated rivals so games between the two teams are less frequent.|$|E

White or purple may also be replaced by black. Some older tape recorders, and equipment like receivers designed to connect to them, use a 5-pin DIN connector to connect left and right for record and playback with a single cable. Adapters between this connector and RCA connectors have used white <b>and</b> <b>red</b> for left <b>and</b> right channel recording, and blue (or sometimes black) and yellow for playback, {{but this is not}} universal.

25|$|The woman appears {{simultaneously}} clothed and unclothed in an {{interplay of}} transparencies, visual, tactile, and motor spaces, evoking {{a series of}} mind-associations between past present and future not atypical of Metzinger's earlier works. Her left breast is seen both from the front and from the side simultaneously. Her pose is elegant. Her face is eminently stylized, her neck is tubiform, her hair almost realistic in appearance as if combed onto the canvas; her shoulders, decidedly cubic from which emanate long slender arms superimposed with geometric elements that compose the background. Depth of field is practically non-present. Blues, whites <b>and</b> <b>reds</b> dominate the composition. Greens and ochers serve to delineate elements in the foreground (arms, leg, table).|$|E
25|$|Rushmore {{uses the}} unique style of {{cinematography}} that Wes Anderson has become well known for. The film has a singular sense of colour, focusing mainly on blues, greens, <b>and</b> <b>reds</b> {{in order to}} create a heightened reality. The montage sequence in the beginning of the film is strongly influenced by the rapid transitions used by French New Wave filmmakers. The shot of Max in the go-cart also resembles a photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue. This montage sequence was almost cancelled by Disney executives as it was not believed that these short singular shots were required in regard to the budget and time frame the film was restricted by. Therefore, the sequence was shot quickly whenever the crew were at a suitable location.|$|E
25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink <b>and</b> <b>reds,</b> the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E
