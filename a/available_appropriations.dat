40|$|Wildland fire {{suppression}} {{policy in the}} USDA Forest Service has evolved over the years from forceful attempts to control all wildland fires at the smallest possible size to consideration of other land management and economic factors during suppression decision making. In 1978, working under congressional direction, the Forest Service started using and developing computer-based models to represent the benefits and costs of budget requests. Over time, the National Fire Management Analysis System (NFMAS) was implemented as the primary fire planning system in several Federal and State agencies. The NFMAS is a tool used by managers to evaluate alternative fire management programs against such things as land management objetives, program budget level, and dispatch strategies. In order to meet future information requirements, the NFMAS will need reengineering and enhancement in several areas. Scientists, software engineers, agency personnel, and others {{need to work together}} so the next generation NFMAS meets the needs of the user community, managers, and agency administrators. The National Fire Management Analysis System (NFMAS) provides the basis for planning and budgeting of the USDA Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management program. By using the NFMAS, long range budget requests are prepared at the National Forest, Regional, and National organizational levels. Current year allocation is based upon those requests and <b>available</b> <b>appropriation.</b> The NFMAS is a fundamental tool to show Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the value of financing the Fire and Aviation Management program. In recent years, several refinements to the original NFMAS have been developed. They improve the ability of the model to reflect and project Fire and Aviation Management program needs and outcomes. This paper provides a brief history of the NFMAS, outlines the current status of the NFMAS, and discusses future enhancements that might be incorporated into the fire planning system...|$|R

This appears to clash with her record in office, on the basis of which she has previously been seen as a staunch enemy of gay liberation. The origins of a queer presentation of the former Prime Minister lie in the attacks made upon her during her time in office which portrayed her as androgynous and perverse. Such attacks were based on the complicated and ambivalent position she occupied by virtue of being a radical pioneer in her career and a believer in traditional moral standards. Aspects of her ambiguous image were subsequently <b>available</b> for <b>appropriation</b> by interest groups, such as Conservative gay men, who wished to obscure the political record of her government in the context of attempts to legitimate their status within their party in the twenty-first century.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fan movement surrounding Lara Croft, a computer-generated character who {{has appeared in}} computer games, comic books, men 2 ̆ 7 s magazines, promotional tours, music videos, calendars, action figures and motion pictures. A fixture of the pop-culture landscape since 1996, Croft embodies or incarnates a nexus of cultural, economic, and technological forces, whose shared characteristic is their powerful hold on a vast audience base. Lara Croft is nothing without her fans. As the founding member of a new mode of celebrity system featuring female digital stars, Croft 2 ̆ 7 s essentially technological nature – the mode of her signification and circulation – produces continuities and ruptures with traditional fan practices, reframing our understandings of categories such as ‘fan’, ‘audience’, ‘character’, and ‘text’ {{in relation to a}} mediascape whose speed and multiplicity mark not just postmodernism, but adaptive responses to postmodernity. From this perspective, Lara Croft is less a singular entity than a coping strategy, a mediation of media. The concerns of this project are, first, to examine Lara Croft as a conjunction of industrial and representational forces intended to promote certain types of reception and consumption; second, to assess the ways in which her peculiar semiotic status – simultaneously open-ended and concrete – renders her <b>available</b> for <b>appropriation</b> and elaboration by fans; and, finally, to discuss the ways in which Croft 2 ̆ 7 s fandom opens up new debates about the relationship between texts, audiences, and technology...|$|R

By taking everyday practices as the principal units of analysis, they have moved towards acknowledging the socially and materially structured nature of human activity. However, to inform sustainable HCI we also need to understand how practices are part of wider experiential environments and flows of practical activity. In this article, we develop an approach rooted in phenomenological anthropology and sensory ethnography. This approach builds on theories of place, perception and movement and enables us to situate practices, and understand practical activity, as emplaced within complex and shifting ecologies of things. Drawing an ongoing interdisciplinary study of domestic energy consumption and digital media use we discuss ethnographic and design practice examples.

The Fiscal Year 1990 Appropriations Act, Public Law 101 - 101, authorized a separate Isotope Revolving Fund account for the Program, which was to support itself solely from the proceeds of isotope sales.

40|$|The {{human rights}} that are defended in libertarian {{literature}} {{tend to be}} limited in scope, which entails that the duties that people can be compelled to fulfil are similarly minimal. For this reason a commitment to libertarianism tends {{to be seen as}} incompatible with support for subsistence rights, enforceable positive duties, and redistributive taxation, since each one of these issues may require the infringement of libertarian property rights. In this thesis I aim to challenge these assumptions about libertarianism and to show that if a more plausible reading of libertarianism is adopted – {{what has come to be}} known as left-libertarianism – then this will generate a more substantial range of rights and correlative duties which are not only compatible with redistributive taxation, but in fact entail it. I show that libertarianism, despite its contention that human rights are exclusively negative, does not rule out subsistence rights provided that these are understood as negative rights, for example: a right not to be deprived of the means of subsistence, or deprived of a clean living environment. Negative rights can be violated not only by individuals or by institutions, but also by individuals supporting institutions. In order to respect the negative rights of others it is necessary to refrain from supporting or contributing to institutions that violate these rights. Moreover, failure to respect these rights brings about a positive duty of rectification, demonstrating the potential for positive libertarian duties even in the absence of positive rights. Since the manner in which rights can be violated is extensive, so is the scope of those individuals that owe rectification. The fundamental libertarian rights of self-ownership, which I characterise as three property rights – over the body, over the faculties (including talents, abilities and labour) and over what one can produce through exercising those faculties in conjunction with the body – demonstrate how we can come to have property rights over external objects, but self-ownership does not confer permanent private property rights over unlimited external worldly resources. In fact, a robust right of self-ownership is incompatible with the radically inegalitarian appropriation with which libertarianism is ordinarily associated. Given the equal rights of selfownership of every individual, it is far more plausible to conceive of the world as held in some egalitarian manner, rather than as unowned and <b>available</b> for <b>appropriation</b> in such a way that would disadvantage latecomers. I propose an egalitarian understanding of world ownership which comprises common ownership of land, and joint ownership of other external worldly resources such as oil and minerals. Taking the injustice of radically inegalitarian appropriation in conjunction with a duty to rectify past injustices, there follows a libertarian argument for redistribution, but crucially this redistributive taxation is collected not on income but on natural resource use. On a left-libertarian theory of rights, then, there is no right to appropriate unlimited resources, but there is a right to redistribution in the event of past injustices, including the misappropriation of worldly resources.
