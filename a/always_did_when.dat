[...] However, those who knew Churchill and [...] on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that [...] "Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter" [...] in her 1941 book I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary. She also noted about one incident [...] "It’s s s simply s s splendid" [...] he stuttered, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> excited." [...] Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of The American Mercury (1942) that [...] "Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple" [...] and that [...] "born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man’s perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time." ...|$|E

60|$|Ned Hampton {{went back}} to breakfast at the cart, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> Jacob was there.|$|E
60|$|Maxwell {{appeared}} to {{smile as he}} had <b>always</b> <b>done</b> <b>when</b> his partner was unusually emphatic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so?" [...] Bessie {{looked down at}} it, first {{on one side and}} then on the other, as a woman <b>always</b> <b>does</b> <b>when</b> her dress is spoken of.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Lord, sir!' {{answered}} the girl, turning pale, which they <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> I show any sparks of anger, 'Don't {{put yourself in}} a passion--I'll put the letter in the post.|$|R
6000|$|... "Botheration! {{you don't}} {{want me to}} turn telltale, do you?" [...] growled Steve, pulling his top-knot, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> perplexed.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{dismissed}} {{the subject as}} abruptly as she <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> the conversation touched too nearly on the sensitive edge of her soul dreams.|$|E
60|$|Captain Truck {{shook the}} baronet heartily by the hand, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> this offer was renewed, declaring that his {{feelings}} did him honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> I take pains," [...] said Colville. [...] "The {{trouble is}} that I don't always take pains. But I thought I would to-night, in upon a lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit up, my Lord? bless you, no! I {{shall have}} {{half of our}} Cat's bed; as I <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> there's company." [...] And with this Mrs. Score curtseyed and retired.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind,' said Amy, as Anne departed--and {{he looked}} disconcerted, as a precise man <b>always</b> <b>does</b> <b>when</b> {{catching}} {{himself in a}} mistake--'Anne is used to it, Guy is <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> it, and puzzles poor Arnaud sorely by sending him for Miss Amabel's parasol.' ...|$|R
60|$|Philip reddened to {{the roots}} of his hair, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> any {{reference}} was made to his club-foot. Mr. Perkins looked at him gravely.|$|E
6000|$|Her lips had quivered; and Winton's heart softened, as it <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> {{he saw her}} moved. He put {{his hand}} out, covered one of hers, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't do that!" [...] Milton said, in horror. But Bill {{drew the}} bow across the strings {{in the same}} way that Daddy <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> tuning up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thinkin' of my wife, and wishin' she was here, {{bless her}} heart! set me rememberin' how I see her fust, and so I roared, as I <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> it comes into my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I can't {{say that}} I did. I looked up, as a sailor <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> <b>when</b> I was on deck this morning, {{but it was}} clear enough then, and I have not noticed it {{particularly}} since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother {{is going}} to offer {{up a lot of}} candles in the church. She <b>always</b> <b>does</b> <b>when</b> Nostromo has been away fighting. I shall have some to carry up to the Chapel of the Madonna in the Cathedral." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Ailie, {{looking very}} grave and earnest, as she <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> our Maker's name {{happened}} to be mentioned. [...] "Does God work miracles still?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid he'll {{laugh at}} our paper, and {{make fun of}} us afterward," [...] {{observed}} Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> doubtful.|$|E
60|$|The Honourable Hilary gave a grunt, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> he was {{surprised}} and displeased, as though some one had prodded him with a stick in a sensitive spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I've {{caught a}} cold in my head. I <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> I {{go in the}} water with my clothes on. And it takes me weeks to get over it, too. I {{think it was a}} shame to serve me so." ...|$|R
5000|$|As he had <b>always</b> <b>done</b> <b>when</b> {{not in the}} {{legislature}} himself, he continued to spend time during the session at Madison lobbying for labor. Weber died in Milwaukee on February 4, 1943, known as [...] "the grand old man of Wisconsin labor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She <b>always</b> <b>does</b> <b>when</b> Aunt Jo {{gets into}} a vortex. Daisy is a model housekeeper; and you couldn't do better than make your bow to her, if you can't {{go to work and}} wait till you are grown up before you begin lovering.' ...|$|R
60|$|Pony {{pushed his}} toe into the turf, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> he was ashamed, {{but he made}} out to say he would rather wait out on the front steps.|$|E
60|$|Instead of answering, Tyrker {{laughed again}} {{and began to}} talk, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> greatly moved, in Turkish. Altogether he was so much excited that Krake said he was {{certainly}} drunk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} you heard him rightly, Toby, boy?" [...] asked the old gentleman as he pushed his glasses up on his forehead, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> he was {{surprised}} or perplexed.|$|E
60|$|On Monday {{the thing}} {{had become of}} {{importance}} to him. Things <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> they are kept over. Before tea that evening when he came down Mrs. Bell and Susan only were in the room. He knew Hetta for his foe, and therefore determined to use this occasion.|$|R
60|$|Then Marais {{followed}} them, {{throwing up}} {{his arms and}} still cursing as he went, and, slipping over {{the tail of the}} pack-ox, Pereira followed him. So the Vrouw Prinsloo and I were left alone, for the coloured men had departed, as they <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> white people begin to quarrel.|$|R
6000|$|... "They charged!" [...] {{cried the}} Sultan in misery. [...] "Don't say that! Have they charged again! Just Allah!" [...] he added, turning to Toomuch. [...] "They have charged again! And we must pay, {{we shall have}} to pay--we <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> they charge. Alas, alas, they have charged again. Everything is charged!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be careful," [...] pleaded Dave. [...] "I love {{to watch}} a storm--I <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> <b>when</b> I was on the farm. I never thought of hiding, {{no matter how hard}} it thundered or lightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{have to pay}} a {{swinging}} half-yearly bill, then, eh, Tulliver? The clergymen have highish notions, in general," [...] said Mr. Deane, taking snuff vigorously, as he <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> {{wishing to}} maintain a neutral position.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} nothing better,' cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as they <b>always</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> he was pleased. 'But how could I get there? Not by water. Ugh! It makes me ill {{to think of}} it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Gurney, {{come right}} up, {{and say that}} you bear no grudge against Jim. He knows {{that you were in}} the right when you insisted on having the horses cared for, and he would have known it last night if he hadn't got excited, as he <b>always</b> <b>does</b> <b>when</b> {{anything}} is up." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Makely irrelevantly {{returned}} to the question that had first provoked her indignation. [...] "And I should {{like to know how}} much worse it is to have a back elevator for the servants than it is to have the basement door for the servants, as you <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you live in a separate house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The men felt uncomfortable. Englishmen <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> the {{unconventional}} hovers about in their neatly ordered atmosphere. Common-sense--in their case--whispered loudly, inking {{that this man}} in the Sackville Street clothes, member of their own clubs, by Jove! could not just be a murderer! Hang it all! Harris would not allow his daughter to go about with a murderer! ...|$|R
