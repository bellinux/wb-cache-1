5|$|In some cases, these {{algorithms}} can {{be extended}} to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by <b>applying</b> the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on <b>applying</b> the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off <b>applying</b> to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students <b>applying</b> to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when <b>applying</b> for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E
