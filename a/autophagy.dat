5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called <b>autophagy.</b> The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autophagy</b> and {{apoptosis}} {{are connected}} both positively and negatively, and extensive crosstalk {{exists between the}} two. During nutrient deficiency, <b>autophagy</b> functions as a pro-survival mechanism, however, excessive <b>autophagy</b> may lead to cell death, a process morphologically distinct from apoptosis. Several pro-apoptotic signals, such as TNF, TRAIL, and FADD, also induce <b>autophagy.</b> Additionally, Bcl-2 inhibits Beclin-1-dependent <b>autophagy,</b> thereby functioning both as a pro-survival and as an anti-autophagic regulator.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autophagy</b> and {{apoptosis}} are {{two different}} cell death mechanisms brought on by high levels of ROS in the cells, however; <b>autophagy</b> and apoptosis rarely act through strictly independent pathways. There is a clear connection between ROS and <b>autophagy</b> and a correlation seen between excessive amounts of ROS leading to apoptosis. The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is also characteristic of the initiation of <b>autophagy.</b> When mitochondria are damaged and begin to release ROS, <b>autophagy</b> is initiated {{to dispose of the}} damaging organelle. If a drug targets mitochondria and creates ROS, <b>autophagy</b> may dispose of so many mitochondria and other damaged organelles that the cell is no longer viable. The extensive amount of ROS and mitochondrial damage may also signal for apoptosis. The balance of <b>autophagy</b> within the cell and the crosstalk between <b>autophagy</b> and apoptosis mediated by ROS is crucial for a cell’s survival. This crosstalk and connection between <b>autophagy</b> and apoptosis could be a mechanism targeted by cancer therapies or used in combination therapies for highly resistant cancers.|$|E
25|$|Decreased <b>autophagy</b> – {{decreased}} {{level of}} degradation of damaged organelles. Postprandial levels inhibit <b>autophagy</b> completely.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autophagy</b> {{is when a}} cell digests some of its own organelles by {{lysosomal}} degradation. <b>Autophagy</b> {{is employed}} to remove damaged organelles, or under starvation conditions to provide additional nutrients. Normally, <b>autophagy</b> occurs by the TSC-Mtor pathway, but can be induced by ROS. TIGAR, even at very low levels, inhibits <b>autophagy</b> by decreasing ROS levels. The mechanism by which TIGAR does this is independent from the Mtor pathway, but the exact details are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown the {{pathways}} and associations between ROS levels and apoptosis, but a newer line of study has connected ROS levels and <b>autophagy.</b> ROS can also induce cell death through <b>autophagy,</b> which is a self-catabolic process involving sequestration of cytoplasmic contents (exhausted or damaged organelles and protein aggregates) for degradation in lysosomes. Therefore, <b>autophagy</b> can also regulate the cell’s health in times of oxidative stress. <b>Autophagy</b> can be induced by ROS levels through many different pathways in the cell {{in an attempt to}} dispose of harmful organelles and prevent damage, such as carcinogens, without inducing apoptosis. Autophagic cell death can be prompted by the over expression of <b>autophagy</b> where the cell digests too much of itself in an attempt to minimize the damage and can no longer survive. When this type of cell death occurs, an increase or loss of control of <b>autophagy</b> regulating genes is commonly co-observed. Thus, once a more in-depth understanding of autophagic cell death is attained and it’s relation to ROS, this form of programmed cell death may serve as a future cancer therapy.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that, as the virus infects human cells, host homeostatic processes like <b>autophagy</b> and ER stress response, {{not to mention}} apoptosis, are triggered depending on the infected cell type. The activation of <b>autophagy</b> and ER stress during infection enhances virus reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{looked for}} {{specific}} markers and for proteomic and genomic tumor signatures that distinguish CSCs from others. In 2009, scientists identified the compound salinomycin, which selectively reduces {{the proportion of}} breast CSCs in mice by more than 100-fold relative to Paclitaxel, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. Some types of cancer cells can survive treatment with salinomycin through <b>autophagy,</b> whereby cells use acidic organelles such as lysosomes to degrade and recycle certain types of proteins. The use of <b>autophagy</b> inhibitors can kill cancer stem cells that survive by <b>autophagy.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} regulator of <b>autophagy</b> induction is the kinase mTOR, which when activated, suppresses <b>autophagy</b> {{and when}} not activated promotes it. Three related serine/threonine kinases, UNC-51-like kinase -1, -2, and -3 (ULK1, ULK2, UKL3), which play a similar {{role as the}} yeast Atg1, act downstream of the mTOR complex. ULK1 and ULK2 form a large complex with the mammalian homolog of an autophagy-related (Atg) gene product (mAtg13) and the scaffold protein FIP200. Class III PI3K complex, containing hVps34, Beclin-1, p150 and Atg14-like protein or ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), {{is required for the}} induction of <b>autophagy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidence that Focal Adhesion Kinase, {{a protein}} that regulates cell adhesion, is also {{involved}} in regulation of <b>autophagy,</b> a potential cancer cell survival mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Macroautophagy, often {{referred}} to as <b>autophagy,</b> is a catabolic process that results in the autophagosomic-lysosomal degradation of bulk cytoplasmic contents, abnormal protein aggregates, and excess or damaged organelles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autophagy</b> is {{generally}} activated by conditions of nutrient deprivation but {{has also been}} associated with physiological as well as pathological processes such as development, differentiation, neurodegenerative diseases, stress, infection and cancer.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-8 {{has been}} shown to play a {{specific}} role in assessing endosomal integrity. After pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses, are engulfed by cells, they typically try to exit the endosome to gain access to nutrients in the cytosol. Galectin-8 specifically binds to glycosylation found within the endosome, and recruits adapter machinery CALCOCO2 which activates antibacterial <b>autophagy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Based on {{different}} cardiac hypertrophy models, {{it has been}} demonstrated that cardiac stress can result in gene expression changes and alter cardiac function. These changes are mediated through HATs/HDACs posttranslational modification signaling. HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A was reported to reduce stress induced cardiomyocyte <b>autophagy.</b> Studies on p300 and CREB-binding protein linked cardiac hypertrophy with cellular HAT activity suggesting an essential role of histone acetylation status with hypertrophy responsive genes such as GATA4, SRF, and MEF2.|$|E
25|$|Unlike type I IFNs, Interferon gamma is not {{approved}} {{yet for the}} treatment of any cancer.However, improved survival was observed when Interferon gamma was administrated to patients with bladder carcinoma and melanoma cancers. The most promising result was achieved in patients with stage 2 and 3 of ovarian carcinoma.The in vitro study of IFN-gamma in cancer cells is more extensive and results indicate anti-proliferative activity of IFN-gamma leading to the growth inhibition or cell death, generally induced by apoptosis but sometimes by <b>autophagy.</b>|$|E
25|$|The longest a human {{has ever}} been proven to live is 122 years, the case of Jeanne Calment {{who was born in}} 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum {{lifespan}} of a wildtype mouse, commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant defenses, energy metabolism, proteostasis maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as <b>autophagy.</b>|$|E
25|$|HPV- and HPV+OPC are {{distinguishable}} at {{the molecular}} level. The naturally occurring (wild type) p53 is widely involved in cellular processes, including <b>autophagy,</b> response to DNA damage, cell cycle regulation and senescence, apoptosis and the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. The gene encoding p53 is inactivated by E6 at the protein level and is found as the wild type in HPV+OPC but mutated in HPV-OPC. In HPV+OPC p53 protein undergoes accelerated degradation by E6, drastically reducing its levels, while in HPV-OPC it undergoes genetic mutation, which may result in synthesis of an abnormal p53 protein, that may not only be inactive as a tumour suppressor, but can also bind and inactivate any non-mutated wild type p53, {{with an increase in}} oncogenic activity. Although p53 mutations occur in HPV+OPC, they are far less common than in HPV-OPC (26% vs 48%), and do not appear to affect clinical outcome.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Orthoreovirus genus {{have been}} known to cause {{apoptosis}} in host cells, and have thus been studied fairly extensively for this very purpose. Mammalian orthoreoviruses induce apoptosis via the activation of several death receptors—TNFR, TRAIL, and Fas—while avian orthoreovirus has been found to use the up-regulation of p53 to induce apoptosis. Both of these strains have also been found to be involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest. The avian orthoreovirus has also been proven to promote <b>autophagy</b> of the host which could contribute to disease in a similar manner as apoptosis. The inhibition of the innate immune response has also been seen in mammalian and avian orthoreoviruses. Other strains of the orthoreoviruses have not been studied as frequently as mammalian and avian strains resulting in a lack of understanding in the pathophysiology of those strains, though it can be assumed they act in similar ways.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{manner in}} which ROS defends the host from invading microbe is not fully understood. One of the more likely modes of defense is damage to {{microbial}} DNA. Studies using Salmonella demonstrated that DNA repair mechanisms were required to resist killing by ROS. More recently, a role for ROS in antiviral defense mechanisms has been demonstrated via Rig-like helicase-1 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Increased levels of ROS potentiate signaling through this mitochondria-associated antiviral receptor to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), resulting in an antiviral state. Respiratory epithelial cells were recently demonstrated to induce mitrochondrial ROS in response to influenza infection. This induction of ROS led to the induction of type III interferon and the induction of an antiviral state, limiting viral replication. In host defense against mycobacteria, ROS play a role, although direct killing is likely not the key mechanism; rather, ROS likely affect ROS-dependent signalling controls, such as cytokine production, <b>autophagy,</b> and granuloma formation.|$|E
25|$|A cancer cell can die {{in three}} ways: apoptosis, {{necrosis}} and <b>autophagy.</b> Excessive ROS can induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which {{is necessary for}} subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 as well as apoptosis induction. In the intrinsic pathway, ROS function to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer). The intrinsic pathway {{is also known as}} the caspase cascade and is induced through mitochondrial damage which triggers the release of cytochrome c. DNA damage, oxidative stress, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential lead to the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins mentioned above stimulating apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage is closely linked to apoptosis and since mitochondria are easily targeted there is potential for cancer therapy.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{flattened}} shape, satellite glial cells contain all common organelles {{necessary to}} make cellular products and to maintain the homeostatic environment of the cell. The plasma membrane of SGCs is thin and not very dense, and it is associated with adhesion molecules, receptors for neurotransmitters and other molecules, and ion channels, specifically potassium ion channels. Within individual SGCs, there is both rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but the latter is much less abundant. Most often the Golgi apparatus and the centrioles in an SGC are found in a region {{very close to the}} cell’s nucleus. On the other hand, mitochondria are found throughout the cytoplasm along with the organelles involved in <b>autophagy</b> and other forms of catabolic degradation, such as lysosomes, lipofuscin granules, and peroxisomes. Both microtubules and intermediate filaments can be seen throughout the cytoplasm, and most often they lie parallel to the SGC sheath. These filaments are found in greater concentrations at the axon hillock and at the beginning portion of an axon in an SGC of the sympathetic ganglia. In some SGCs of the sensory ganglia researchers have seen a single cilium that extends outward from the cell surface near the nucleus and into the extracellular space of a deep indentation in the plasma membrane. The cilium, however, only has the nine pairs of peripheral microtubules while it lacks the axial pair of microtubules, making its structure very similar to the cilia of neurons, Schwann cells, and astrocytes of the CNS.|$|E
2500|$|AMPK {{activates}} <b>autophagy</b> by {{directly and}} indirectly activating ULK1. [...] AMPK also appears to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis by regulating PGC1α which in turn promotes gene transcription in mitochondria. [...] AMPK also activates anti-oxidant defenses.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} <b>autophagy</b> {{research}} experienced accelerated growth {{at the turn}} of the century. Knowledge of ATG genes provided scientists more convenient tools to dissect functions of <b>autophagy</b> in human health and disease. In 1999, a landmark discovery connecting <b>autophagy</b> with cancer was published by Beth Levine’s group. To this date, relationship between cancer and <b>autophagy</b> continues to be a main theme of <b>autophagy</b> research. The roles of <b>autophagy</b> in neurodegeneration and immune defense also received considerable attention. In 2003, the first Gordon conference on <b>autophagy</b> was held at Waterville. In 2005, Daniel J Klionsky launched “Autophagy”, a scientific journal dedicated to this field. The first Keystone Symposia on <b>autophagy</b> was held in 2007 at Monterey.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>autophagy</b> {{decreases}} {{with age}} and age is a major risk factor for osteoarthritis, the role of <b>autophagy</b> {{in the development of}} this disease is suggested. Proteins involved in <b>autophagy</b> are reduced with age in both human and mouse articular cartilage. Mechanical injury to cartilage explants in culture also reduced <b>autophagy</b> proteins. <b>Autophagy</b> is constantly activated in normal cartilage but it is compromised {{with age and}} precedes cartilage cell death and structural damage. These results suggest <b>autophagy</b> is a normal protective process (chondroprotection) in the joint.|$|E
50|$|New {{developments}} in research {{have found that}} targeted <b>autophagy</b> may be a viable therapeutic solution in fighting cancer. As discussed above, <b>autophagy</b> plays both a role in tumor suppression and tumor cell survival. Thus, the qualities of <b>autophagy</b> {{can be used as}} a strategy for cancer prevention. The first strategy is to induce <b>autophagy</b> and enhance its tumor suppression attributes. The second strategy is to inhibit <b>autophagy</b> and thus induce apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, <b>autophagy</b> {{has also}} been shown to play a huge role in tumor cell survival. In {{cancerous}} cells, <b>autophagy</b> is used as {{a way to deal with}} stress on the cell. Once these <b>autophagy</b> related genes were inhibited, cell death was potentiated. The increase in metabolic energy is offset by <b>autophagy</b> functions. These metabolic stresses include hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and an increase in proliferation. These stresses activate <b>autophagy</b> in order to recycle ATP and maintain survival of the cancerous cells. <b>Autophagy</b> has been shown to enable continued growth of tumor cells by maintaining cellular energy production. By inhibiting <b>autophagy</b> genes in these tumors cells, regression of the tumor and extended survival of the organs affected by the tumors were found. Furthermore, inhibition of <b>autophagy</b> {{has also been}} shown to enhance the effectiveness of anticancer therapies.|$|E
50|$|Generally, <b>autophagy</b> {{includes}} three small branches, which are macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated <b>autophagy.</b>|$|E

In addition his research has advanced the basic understanding of <b>autophagy,</b> identifying the plasma membrane as a source of autophagosome membrane and characterising early events in autophagosome biogenesis,. Furthermore, he studied how lysosomal positioning regulates <b>autophagy.</b> His goal is to understand the links between these diseases and <b>autophagy.</b> He is currently focused on understanding how to induce <b>autophagy</b> in vivo in order to remove toxic proteins and avoid the development of neurodegenerative disease ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autophagy</b> is {{the process}} by which {{endogenous}} proteins and damaged organelles are destroyed intracellularly. <b>Autophagy</b> is postulated to be essential for cell homeostasis and cell remodeling during differentiation, metamorphosis, non-apoptotic cell death, and aging.

50|$|<b>Autophagy</b> then {{occurs at}} an {{accelerated}} rate. In <b>autophagy,</b> cells cannibalize critical molecules to produce amino acids for gluconeogenesis.
