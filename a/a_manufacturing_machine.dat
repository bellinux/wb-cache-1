40|$|The {{application}} of anomaly detection techniques {{has not been}} investigated much on energy consumption data of machines or motors. In this work required preprocessing methods and anomaly detection techniques for energy data and motor current data are presented. The preprocessing of energy consumption data recorded from <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machine</b> requires the following steps: segmentation of the energy consumption data in product specific signals, clustering of those signals and ltering of autonomic overlaying signals. The method used for segmentation is based on thresholds. In order to arrange the signals according to their product type a clustering algorithm based on cross{correlation is implemented. These two steps are successfully tested on the given dataset. An approach to filter autonomous overlaying signals by means of median calculation was devised and tested for simulated data but proved to be unsatisfactory for the real data. The preprocessing of motor currents being directly recorded from a motor involves a method which has never been used before {{on this kind of}} data: the continuos wavelet transformation. This method is used to extract features and consequently classify motor current signals to detect anomalies in motors such as broken bars and end{ring connectors. Therefore, several machine learning techniques are evaluated for classifying. Of all used classifers support vector machines reached the highest accurarcy rate of 92. 81 % for all 21 classes...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes and {{discusses}} an active dual-sensor autofocusing method {{for measuring the}} positioning errors of arrays of small holes on complex curved surfaces. The dual-sensor unit combines an optical vision sensor and a tactile probe and is designed to achieve rapid automated measurements {{in a way that}} can be adapted to be suitable for deployment on <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machine</b> tool. Mathematical analysis is performed to establish the magnitude of the deviation from the optimal focal length that is induced by the autofocussing method. This evaluation is based on the geometrical relationship and interaction between the radius of the tactile probe with both the measured holes and the complex-curved surface. A description is provided of a laboratory-based standalone dual-sensor autofocusing unit and test rig that was built to perform experimental validation of the method. This system is estimated to have a focusing uncertainty of 11 μm deriving mainly from the inaccuracy of the X-Z translation stage and the maximum permissible error of the tactile probe. A case study is presented which evaluates the accuracy of a pattern of Ø 0. 5 mm small holes on an elliptic cylinder. A mathematical analysis of that problem and practical results from both the tactile and optical sensors are provided and discussed. It is estimated that the deviation in optimal focusing induced by this automated method is between - 23 μm and + 95 μm. This is sufficiently accurate to ensure that the optical device can capture the entire space outline of each of the small holes on the complex curve surface clearly and can therefore identify its centroid from the image to provide a measurement of the position...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing of {{high-quality}} components and assemblies is clearly recognised by industrialised nations {{as an important}} means of wealth generation. A “right first time” paradigm to producing finished components is the desirable goal to maximise economic benefits and reduce environmental impact. Such an ambition is only achievable through an accurate model of the machinery used to shape the finished article. In the first analysis, computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) {{can be used to}} produce an instruction list of three-dimensional coordinates and intervening tool paths to translate the intent of a design engineer into an unambiguous set of commands for <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machine.</b> However, in order for the resultant manufacturing program to produce the desired output within the specified tolerance, the model of the machine has to be sufficiently accurate. In this paper, the spatial and temporal sources of error and various contemporary means of modelling are discussed. Limitations and assumptions in the models are highlighted and an estimate of their impact is made. Measurement of machine tools plays a vital role in establishing the accuracy of a particular machine and calibrating its unique model, but is an often misunderstood and misapplied discipline. Typically, the individual errors of the machine will be quantified at a given moment in time, but without sufficient consideration either for the uncertainty of individual measurements or a full appreciation of the complex interaction between each independently measured error. This paper draws on the concept of a “conformance zone”, as specified in the ISO 230 : 1 – 2012, to emphasise the need for a fuller understanding of the complex uncertainty of measurement model for a machine tool. Work towards closing the gap in this understanding is described and limitations are noted...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{concerns}} diagnostics of servo-drives. The proposed computer-assisted way of {{the feedback}} signals measurements can be applied as a simple and low cost solution useful for inspection and on-line monitoring of the servo-drives motional accuracy and also data collecting for later analysis. Despite {{the fact that the}} feedback devices installed in the servo-drives can be different the square wave signals are commonly used in position and commutation loops as their output signals. This kind of signals can be applied for quite simple in realisation digital measurements of both velocity and position increments. Lack of limitations in the distance and trajectory of the inspected movement as well as possibility to perform and repeat the tests on an operating machine without any interrupting its working process seem to be their valuable features. However, it is necessary to have at disposal quite simple but properly prepared equipment and right software instruments when <b>a</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machine</b> with the servo-drives has to be inspected with different static and dynamic tests by this way.

On the other hand the list of requirements includes also non problematic and time saving planning, sizing, commissioning and diagnostics of the drives.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machine</b> at the {{engineering}} company Sandvik Coromant has a positioning table which {{task is to}} move an item linearly. The positioning table has a linear motor capable of high velocity and acceleration. This {{makes it possible to}} achieve short cycle times and a more profitable production. The purpose of this thesis is to bring forward a new concept which is more adapted to the requirements of the positioning table. The reason is that the current positioning table provides an unnecessarily positioning accuracy of 0. 01 mm, while the requirement for the positioning accuracy is just 0. 1 mm. The goal is to reduce manufacturing and component costs. To develop a suitable solution an approach for the concept development process has been performed. The concept development process has been decomposed thoroughly to the positioning table’s basic functions where critical sub-problems have been identified. The information has been retrieved both internally and externally through interviews, literature, benchmarking, discussions and observations. A brainstorming has been performed where the different sub-problems were discussed. The brainstorming was used to create different ideas through sketches. This resulted in eight concepts. The developed concepts were later evaluated in a concept evaluation method called Concept scoring to select the best concept. Calculations were performed on the force caused by the surrounding equipment of the positioning table. The calculations were used as a basis when designing the different concepts. The best concept was found based on the Concept scoring and refined to meet all the requirements of the positioning table. The selected concept has a more compact solution with a shorter length and fewer components. This means that the installation of the new positioning table becomes easier. The new concept has a considerably simpler design than the current positioning table leading to a much cheaper solution. The current positioning table has a cost of 155 000 SEK while the new concept will cost about 60 000 SEK, a reduction of 61 %. The current positioning table and new concept requires same type of maintenance...|$|E

Selected from 200 papers from 7 th Mechatronics Forum International Conference, USA, for a Special issue on Virtual Manufacturing (International Society of Agile Manufacturing). To support all phases of an agile modular manufacturing machine life cycle with CAE and Virtual Manufacturing tools, {{a number of different}} engineering applications (e. g. specialist software based tools) are typically used for design, simulation, analysis, programming, control and monitoring of a machine. These applications mainly exist today as small applications islands where each of them manages their own data.

These application islands often use different storage technologies. Each one of the applications has an information structure to separate the information connected to each machine; however, they do not necessarily use the same information structure. Another issue concerning these applications is the functionality that is implemented in them to manage information; namely, processes such as store, retrieve, search, permissions, etc. The functionality for one process is the same in all applications that has the process implemented. But the implementation of the process functionality may differ, due to misinterpretation of the functionality specification and regular implementation bugs, which could lead to problem with integrity and consistency of the data. Applications that make use of newer information technologies, such as databases and software development tools can simplify the implementation of the functionality but each application still has to implement their own version of the functionality.
