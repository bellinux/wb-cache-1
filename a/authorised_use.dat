50|$|During {{the flight}} testing phase of {{development}} work upon the initial CA-12 model, CAC commenced work upon a new variant which featured performance improvements {{in terms of}} speed, climb and ceiling. Designated CA-14, this aircraft was designed around an order for 145 U.S.-built, 1,700 hp (1,268 kW) Wright Cyclone R-2600 engines. The Wright engines ordered were not delivered as scheduled, and in mid-1942 Wackett <b>authorised</b> <b>use</b> of the 1,850 hp (1,380 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800, which was available from the CAC factory in Lidcombe. Due to {{the layout of the}} Boomerang's compact fuselage, the supercharger for the engine was installed in the rear fuselage, while a new three-bladed variable pitch Curtiss-built propeller was also initially adopted.|$|E
50|$|One {{of the few}} {{aspects of}} the film to receive {{positive}} acclaim (other than the special effects) was Sophia Myles' performance as iconic superspy Lady Penelope, a portrayal in a style identical to that of her television counterpart. Another positive view was Ron Cook as Lady Penelope's butler and chauffeur Parker. The Thunderbirds craft, as well as Tracy Island, were also seen to be {{very close to the}} style of the original designs. Purists disliked the fact that FAB-1, Lady Penelope's car, was a Ford rather than a Rolls-Royce. However, this was because the producers could not reach a suitable agreement with BMW in the <b>authorised</b> <b>use</b> the Rolls-Royce marque; the car manufacturer insisted that only an actual production model could be used. Ford stepped in with special version of their Thunderbird model, duplicating the six-wheel system on the Supermarionation Rolls. FAB-1 steers with the four front tyres.|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from BASF Agro SAS to set an import tolerance for prohexadione-calcium in peanuts grown in the United States of America (USA). In order to accommodate for the <b>authorised</b> <b>use</b> in the USA, France proposed to raise the existing MRL of prohexadione in peanuts from the limit of quantification of 0. 1 mg/kg to 0. 9 mg/kg. France drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 9 mg/kg for the import tolerance request of prohexadione-calcium on peanuts. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of the active substance in peanuts. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed MRL for peanuts supporting the <b>authorised</b> <b>use</b> of prohexadione-calcium in the USA will not result in a long-term consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health ris...|$|E

40|$|Recurrent and {{systematic}} underinvestment (or inadequate management) results in capability shortfalls, {{that can only}} be compensated by ‘outsourcing’ to Private Military Companies. While the use of private companies for corporate or logistic functions might be manageable, complementary and legitimate, outsour-cing inherently governmental functions as the use of force to hired guns inevitably leads to legal, military and political issues. Even with an adequate management structure, not all military functions can be privatized, since activities or functions linked with the state’s monopoly on the (<b>authorised)</b> <b>use</b> of force as well as core military missioncritical functions should be banned from privatization. Assuredly, Defence & Security investments deserve a better outcome than keeping the balance sheets of private companies in the green: critical awareness and an independent knowledge base on the good, the bad and the ugly of hiring Private Military Companies can make the difference for our future (austere) defence budgets between proactive investments in the provision of public security or compelled recourse to private capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Zinc oxide {{is a safe}} {{source of}} zinc for all animal species and no {{concerns}} for consumer safety are expected {{from the use of}} zinc oxide in animal nutrition, considering the maximum contents for total zinc in feedingstuffs set by EU legislation. Zinc oxide is not an irritant to skin and eyes; it is not a skin sensitiser. The zinc oxide under application is considered a compound with high dusting potential, which may result in a critical exposure of users by inhalation, affecting the respiratory system. The <b>authorised</b> <b>use</b> of zinc oxide as a feed additive does not pose a direct concern for the agricultural soil compartment. However, there is a potential environmental concern related to groundwater, drainage and the run-off of zinc to surface water. Acid sandy soils are most vulnerable to these processes. In order to draw a final conclusion, some further refinement to the assessment of zinc-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of zinc-containing additives in aquaculture up to maximum authorised zinc level in feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment. Zinc oxide is efficacious in meeting animal zinc requirements...|$|E
40|$|Background Robust {{evidence}} to direct management {{of pregnant women}} with mild hypertensive disease at term is scarce. We investigated whether induction of labour in women with a singleton pregnancy complicated by gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia reduces severe maternal morbidity. Methods We undertook a multicentre, parallel, open-label randomised controlled trial in six academic and 32 non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands between October, 2005, and March, 2008. We enrolled patients with a singleton pregnancy at 36 - 41 weeks gestation, and who had gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio by block randomisation. with a web-based application system to receive either induction of labour or expectant monitoring. Masking of intervention allocation was not possible. The primary outcome was a composite measure of poor maternal outcome-maternal mortality, maternal morbidity (eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, pulmonary oedema, thromboembolic disease, and placental abruption), progression to severe hypertension or proteinuria, and major post-partum haemorrhage (> 1000 ml, blood loss). Analysis was by intention to treat and treatment effect is presented as relative risk. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 08132825. Findings 756 patients were allocated to receive induction of labour (n= 377 patients) or expectant monitoring (n= 379). 397 patients refused randomisation but <b>authorised</b> <b>use</b> of their medical records. Of women who were randomised, 117 (31 %) allocated to induction of labour developed poor maternal outcome compared with 166 (44 %) allocated to expectant monitoring (relative risk 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 59 - 0. 86, p < 0. 0001).
