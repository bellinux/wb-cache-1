5|$|The Great Plague {{killed an}} {{estimated}} 100,000 people—almost {{a quarter of}} London's population—in 18 months. The plague {{was caused by the}} Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted through the bite of <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> rat flea.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|VP1 {{is located}} in the core of the virus {{particle}} and is an RNA polymerase enzyme. In <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> cell this enzyme produces mRNA transcripts for the synthesis of viral proteins and produces copies of the rotavirus genome RNA segments for newly produced virus particles.|$|E

5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the Farrars {{were living in}} Cincinnati, Ohio. During this time Green {{suffered}} a number of medical issues, including surgery on <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> wrist, cerebellar migraines, and insomnia. The Farrars' first child, Timothy, was born on January 20, 1982. After a six-week maternity leave, Green returned to her fellowship in hematology and oncology at the University of Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|Fruit and vegetables, {{particularly}} leafy vegetables, {{have been}} implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> food handler. Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{improvements}} in sequencing technologies will allow detailed investigation of within-host evolution, as the full diversity of <b>an</b> <b>infecting</b> quasispecies may be uncovered given enough sequencing effort.|$|R
50|$|An {{epidemiological}} investigation {{can be done}} {{to determine}} a patient's exposure to raw <b>infected</b> meat. Often, <b>an</b> infection arises from home-preparation of contaminated meat, in which case microscopy of the meat may be used to determine the infection. Exposure determination {{does not have to be}} directly from <b>a</b> laboratory-confirmed <b>infected</b> animal. Indirect exposure criteria include the consumption of products from <b>a</b> laboratory-confirmed <b>infected</b> animal, or sharing of a common exposure with <b>a</b> laboratory-confirmed <b>infected</b> human.|$|R

5|$|Gabriel Logan and {{his partner}} Lian Xing {{investigate}} a series of biological outbreaks triggered by international terrorist Erich Rhoemer. When fellow agent Ellis loses contact during a mission in Costa Rica, the top-secret Agency dispatches Gabe and Lian to find him. They discover Ellis is dead, and Rhoemer's suspected drug operation is a cover for the viral operation. Another outbreak in Nepal leads to more questions when <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> person who should have died somehow survived.|$|E
5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also be spread from <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
50|$|Other {{animals such as}} birds, dogs, {{and cats}} may also be affected. <b>A.</b> tubaeforme <b>infects</b> cats, <b>A.</b> caninum <b>infects</b> dogs and <b>A.</b> braziliense and Uncinaria stenocephala infect both cats and dogs.

5|$|Hancock died in 1886 at Governors Island, {{still in}} command of the Military Division of the Atlantic, the victim of <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> carbuncle, {{complicated}} by diabetes. He is buried in Montgomery Cemetery in West Norriton Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, near Norristown, Pennsylvania. Although he outlived both of his children, he was survived by the three grandchildren fathered by his son, Russell. Hancock's wife, Almira, published Reminiscences of Winfield Scott Hancock in 1887.|$|E
5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode of {{transmission}} is through an insect vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes infected with T. cruzi by feeding on the blood of <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{infection}} develops via two phases: {{one that}} involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic phase). When <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically {{for a period of}} 8–30 days.|$|E
50|$|These viruses {{are thought}} to have codiverged with their hosts from a common ancestor. There are at least 3 {{distinct}} clades of tobamoviruses, which to some extent follow their host ranges: that is, there is one <b>infecting</b> solanaceous species; <b>a</b> second <b>infecting</b> cucurbits and legumes and <b>a</b> third <b>infecting</b> the crucifers.|$|R
5|$|When <b>a</b> virus <b>infects</b> <b>a</b> cell, {{the virus}} forces {{it to make}} {{thousands}} more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Hatcher plans {{secretly}} {{to isolate}} the central London area because of the infection. However, <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> man breaks {{into his office and}} tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Michael Canaris, Hatcher's right-hand man, quarantines him and takes his place as de facto Prime Minister. Hatcher later commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The viral load of <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> {{person is}} an {{important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load. If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.|$|E

We also used the mass spectrometry method in the clinical follow-up of <b>a</b> chronically <b>infected</b> patient over <b>a</b> 5 -year period...|$|R
5|$|When <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> person sneezes or coughs, {{more than}} half a million virus {{particles}} can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|A {{stand-alone}} expansion for Infamous 2, titled Infamous: Festival of Blood, {{was announced}} at Gamescom and released on October 25, 2011. A vampire-themed spinoff, Infamous: Festival of Blood features a non-canon story set in New Marais. The story follows <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> Cole that must kill the vampire which bit him {{in order to}} save his soul. The game featured new enemies and powers. A sequel to Infamous 2, titled Infamous Second Son was announced at PlayStation Meeting 2013 for PlayStation 4 and was released on March 31, 2014 worldwide. The game takes place seven years after Infamous 2 and follows a new protagonist in the city of Seattle.|$|E
5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by <b>an</b> <b>infected</b> rat.|$|E
