5|$|Lemur {{behavior}} is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, {{there are often}} exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{continued}} his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy {{and on the}} classification of legitimate authority into three types– rational-legal, traditional and charismatic– of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world. In these works Weber described {{what he saw as}} society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} documents are placed in separate volumes <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source {{for some of these}} materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E

He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.|$|E

A few, indeed, in the centre, whom the praetorian cohort had scattered, lay a little <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> but the wounds even of these were in front. But Catiline was found far in advance of his men amid a heap of slain foemen, still breathing slightly, and showing in his face the indomitable spirit which had animated him when alive.|$|E
25|$|During 1983, {{a related}} {{movement}} was brewing at a London gothic rock club called the Batcave. Initially envisioned as a venue specializing in glam rock and new wave musical acts, {{the two main}} bands which debuted and performed frequently at the Batcave, Specimen and Alien Sex Fiend, developed their own different sounds strongly influenced by horror in British pop culture, which set them <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the glam and post-punk scenes in Britain. Also in 1983, Gun Club toured in Europe as did Christian Death, leading to cross-pollination between the European gothic rock scene and the American deathrock scene.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the island were weakened by years of isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was an epidemic {{on the island and}} a significant proportion of the garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> capital, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> island's defences were manned by a militia formed from local inhabitants, among whom morale was low and desertion rates high. Military and food stores of all kinds were in short supply and the governor, General Jean Augustin Ernouf was unable to maintain garrisons around the island's extensive perimeter.|$|R

25|$|Historically, {{religious}} sects {{and orders}} who desired to live <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of society established themselves in Iowa, {{such as the}} Amish and Mennonite near Kalona and {{in other parts of}} eastern Iowa such as Davis County and Buchanan County. Other religious sects and orders living apart include Quakers around West Branch and Le Grand, German Pietists who founded the Amana Colonies, followers of Transcendental Meditation who founded Maharishi Vedic City, and Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance monks and nuns at the New Melleray and Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbies near Dubuque.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has {{a variety of}} architectural elements from various buildings around the globe that President Baker, CU's president {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, admired. The design of the auditorium is primarily Neo-Gothic, with the primary materials being sandstone and red tile, like the rest of campus. The result is a unique building, with two large towers and sprawling ivy, that sets itself <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the CU campus. Macky was refurbished in 1986, with improved seating, custom carpeting, modern plumbing and an elevator. Currently there is an electronic bell system in the towers of Macky which rings the hours during the day.|$|E
25|$|Ford's {{next two}} films stand {{somewhat}} <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> {{of his films}} in terms of production, and he notably took no salary for either job. The Rising of the Moon (Warner Bros, 1957) was a three-part 'omnibus' movie shot on location in Ireland and based on Irish short stories. It was made by Four Province Productions, a company established by Irish tycoon Lord Killanin, who had recently become Chair of the International Olympic Committee, and to whom Ford was distantly related. Killanin was also the actual (but uncredited) producer of The Quiet Man. The film failed to recoup its costs, earning less than half ($100,000) its negative cost of just over $256,000 and it stirred up some controversy in Ireland.|$|E

Nassar, Sumithra {{and the director}} himself, play supporting roles, while prominent heroine, Shriya Saran, was recruited {{to act as a}} ghost buster and dance in a single song. The film released on 1 February 2008 to largely negative reviews. It was dubbed in Hindi by Cinekorn Productions as Lok Parlok.|$|R
5000|$|Gillette treated {{both sides}} of the American Civil War equally, bestowing integrity, loyalty, and honor on both North and South, even as he made a spy each play's {{sympathetic}} hero. Yet, what set Gillette <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> all <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> was not simply his reliance on realism, his imperturbable naturalistic acting, or his superior sense of the dramatic. He [...] "was also a pioneer in making American drama ‘American’, rejecting what had been up until that time a pervasive European influence on American theater" [...] at a time when American art of all kinds was held in very low esteem by the British.|$|R

On occasion, the emperor is described as having his own table, set <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> The full ceremonial splendor of the hall was reserved for special occasions, such as the banquets for Arab envoys, described in the De Ceremoniis: additional lightning was provided by great chandeliers, imperial regalia, relics and other precious items were brought from various churches and displayed in the apses, while the meal was accompanied by music from two silver and two golden organs, placed in the porch, {{as well as by the}} choirs of the Hagia Sophia and the Holy Apostles.|$|E
25|$|Authority {{derives from}} the age-group and the age-set. Prior to {{circumcision}} a natural leader or Olaiguenani is selected; he leads his age-group {{through a series of}} rituals until old age, sharing responsibility with a select few, of whom the ritual expert (Oloiboni) is the ultimate authority. Masai youths are not circumcised until they are mature, and a new age-set is initiated together at regular intervals of twelve to fifteen years. The young warriors (Il-Murran) remain initiates for some time, using blunt arrows to hunt small birds which are stuffed and tied to a frame to form a head-dress. Traditionally, among the Luhya, boys of certain age-sets, typically between 8 and 18 years of age would, under the leadership of specific men engage in various rites leading up to the day of circumcision. After circumcision, they would live <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of society for a certain number of days. Not even their mothers nor sisters would be allowed to see them.|$|E
25|$|Super Speed Water Slides: These two water slides, {{also known}} as Geronimo Falls, were set {{slightly}} <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> {{of the park and}} took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers {{on the side of the}} slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water—which made a large splash—and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today, however the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides still use the same end splash pool that 2 of the other old speed slides used.|$|E
40|$|For the {{philosophy}} of medicine, {{there are two things}} of interest about the stoic account of moral norms, quite <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of stoic ethical theory is compelling. One is the stoic version of naturalism: its account of practical reasoning, its solution to the is/ought problem, and its contention that norms for creating, sustaining, or restoring human health are tantamount to moral norms. The other is the stoic account of human agency: its description of the intimate connections between human health, rational agency, and moral norms. There is practical guidance to be gained from exploring those connections, whether or not one is ready to follow stoic moral theory all the way to its austere end...|$|R

25|$|Though the {{northern}} provinces had an as yet subordinate {{position in the}} aggregate economy of the Habsburg Netherlands, let alone in the entire Habsburg empire, they possessed economic features that set them <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Europe, and presented them with opportunities {{that did not exist}} elsewhere. Unlike other parts of Europe these lands had not been ravaged severely by the plague pandemic of the 14th century, though like elsewhere that catastrophe contributed to scarcity of labor in the 15th century. The region also faced catastrophe of an ecological nature: the low-lying area was yet insufficiently protected against the sea and was repeatedly subjected to major flooding, of which the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421) was only an outstanding example. This resulted in a major permanent loss of arable land. In addition, the land in the maritime provinces consisted mostly of peat bogs, which form poor land for agriculture, and were at the time extensively exploited for the fuel peat. This resulted again in extensive permanent loss of arable land. Because of these losses many people were driven from the land and forced to seek employment in urban centers. This caused a degree of urbanization even larger than that in Flanders, but also a labor supply for non-agricultural purposes that was more elastic than elsewhere in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{studies of}} parenthetical {{expressions}} suffer from {{not making a}} clear distinction between prosodic, syntactic, semantic, and illocutionary properties. Focussing on French evaluative adverbs such as bizarrement ‘oddly’, we distinguish parentheticality, the illocutionary property of providing a comment on the main content of <b>the</b> utterance, <b>from</b> incidentality, <b>the</b> grammatical status of an expression which is set <b>apart</b> prosodically <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> sentence. While incidentality correlates with positional and scopal properties, parentheticality is an orthogonal property. We then provide a detailed analysis of evaluative adverbs. We show that Potts’s (2005) analysis, while addressing many of the crucial properties of evaluatives, fails to account for their special illocutionary force and their semantic embeddability. We propose an explicit analysis within an HPSG grammar, and propose a modification of MRS (Copestake et al., 2003) that addresses the peculiar status of evaluatives in semantic composition...|$|R
