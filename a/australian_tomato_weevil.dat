40|$|The Closer Economic Relationship with Australia {{agreement}} (CER) {{was brought}} Into effect on 1 January 1983. The CER {{provided for the}} liberalisation of trade between New Zealand and Australia. This liberalisation is to be effected through the gradual elimination of barriers to trade following an established formula. Some departures from the formula are provided for where specific products would be treated in an inappropriate manner if the formula were followed. The objective of the liberalisation procedure is complete removal of barriers to trade by 1995. The granting {{of access to the}} New Zealand market for <b>Australian</b> <b>tomatoes</b> is included in the agreement. The level of access provided caused New Zealand growers of hothouse tomatoes to express concern over the possible impact of imports on the New Zealand industry. This Discussion Paper provides a report on an investigation of the likely impact of <b>Australian</b> <b>tomato</b> supplies on the New Zealand market. It is established that the most probable source of exports to New Zealand is Queensland. A review of Queensland tomato production costs indicates that a price of $A 5. 00 / 10 kg carton would be required by Queensland growers to cover their variable production costs. Additional costs involved in exporting to New Zealand result in a New Zealand market price of $NZ 17. 00 / 10 kg carton ($NZ 1. 70 /kg) being required by Queensland growers. This price can be achieved on the New Zealand market between June and November. Exporting to New Zealand would therefore only be attractive to Queensland growers during that period. The New Zealand hothouse tomato growing industry supplies approximately two thirds of the tomatoes for the freshmarket. These supplies are predominantly during autumn, winter and spring when higher prices are available. During summer, prices are lower as outdoor grown- tomatoes become available. The hothouse tomato growing industry considers that the high winter prices are essential to their profitability. It is probable that some price reductions will occur as a result of imports from Australia being available during winter. However, the quality of the Australian product is likely to be inferior to that available in New Zealand and therefore the price impact will be less. In addition, up to 1988 the quantity of tomatoes able to be imported from Australia is limited to a level equivalent to between 0. 57 per cent and 1. 01 per cent of average New Zealand annual hothouse tomato production. The average variation in New Zealand hothouse tomato production from year to year (over 1975 to 1981) exceeded the total allowable Australian supply by between 14 and 25 times. Therefore the impact of New Zealand supply variations on the market price is likely to be greater than the impact of supplies from Australia. Over the longer term, increased supplies from Australia can be expected to have a greater impact on the New Zealand market. The establishment of appropriate premiums for higher quality New Zealand tomatoes through the use of an effective marketing system would reduce this price lowering effect of imports from Australia. Some reduction in New Zealand hothouse tomato production could be expected as less efficient growers fail to achieve adequate returns. There is likely to be increased total demand for tomatoes during the winter period when lower priced <b>Australian</b> <b>tomatoes</b> are available. Increased outdoor tomato production during the summer months could also be expected to offset reduced hothouse tomato supplies during summer. Overall, prices are likely to be reduced (with premiums available for high quality product) and tomato consumption could be expected to increase...|$|R
40|$|This report {{outlines}} {{a market}} {{analysis of the}} <b>Australian</b> bush <b>tomato</b> (Solanum centrale) and wattle seed (Acacia spp) products. The project was commissioned to explicitly characterise and map the <b>Australian</b> bush <b>tomato</b> and wattle seed value chains from production through to domestic distribution and final consumption, and to identify and evaluate high value market segments that {{might be used to}} focus the business developments associated with these two products. The following criteria were investigated in some detail: Industry stakeholders and activities, product creation and delivery, financial conditions, information conditions, incentives, motivators and drivers, and governance conditions. The analysis has shown that demand for bush food products in general has grown in the last two years, and that currently, bush tomato (BT) is in higher demand than wattle seed (WS). However, it was also found that while a viable and growing bush food industry exists that involves both products, there are considerable challenges to developing a sustainable industry around them, both from a production and from a market perspective...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeveral plant geminiviruses {{have been}} shown {{recently}} to utilize both rolling-circle replication (RCR) and recombination-dependent replication (RDR) strategies. A highly specific binding of the viral replication-associated protein (Rep) to its cognate DNA is essential for initiation of viral DNA replication and for the recognition of DNA components of the bipartite geminiviruses of the Begomovirus genus. We have extended the replication analysis to the monopartite <b>Australian</b> <b>Tomato</b> leaf curl virus (ToLCV), its Rep binding deficient mutants, and the satellite DNAs it supports. Analyses of viral DNA by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis after fractionation by single-stranded (ss) DNA-selective cellulose chromatography revealed that DNA intermediates of ToLCV and its mutant were identical. Both RCR and RDR intermediates were identified. New ToLCV DNA forms were observed and characterized as subgenomic topoisomers, heterogeneous open circular double-stranded (ds) DNA, and degradation products. A 1350 -nt DNA β satellite associated with the unrelated Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV) was supported by ToLCV and produced intermediates of both RCR and RDR, suggesting that replication strategies of satellites {{are determined by the}} helper virus. Replicative intermediates of the 682 nt ToLCV satellite DNA could not be resolved; however, concatemers of up to octamer were detected, together with a field of hybridizing material suggestive of complementary strand replication on heterogeneous circular ssDNA templates...|$|R

40|$|A {{panel of}} murine {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs), selected by indirect ELISA, {{was prepared to}} an isolate (ACMV-JI) of the type strain of African cassava mosaic virus. Of the ten MAbs purified from ascitic fluids, four out of the five tested gave stronger reactions with ACMV-JI in double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) than did rabbit polyclonal antibody. Six of the ten MAbs gave a precipitin reaction in immunodiffusion tests and nine trapped ACMV-JI particles in immunosorbent electron microscopy. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to ACMV reacted in DAS-ELISA not only with ACMV-JI and the Kenya coast strain of ACMV (ACMV-C) but also with five other geminiviruses known or suspected to have the whitefly Bemisia tabaci as a vector, though not with three geminiviruses that have l afhopper or unknown vectors. Of the ten MAbs studied in detail, four did not react with ACMV-C in indirect ELISA and only two reacted strongly. This supports other evidence that ACMV-C is a distinctive strain of ACMV and not merely a minor variant. The other whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (bean golden mosaic, euphorbia mosaic, mung bean yellow mosaic and tomato golden mosaic viruses) and <b>Australian</b> <b>tomato</b> leaf curl virus reacted with two to five MAbs but each virus had a different pattern of reactivity. In contrast, solanum apical leaf curling virus, and the leafhopper-transmitted b et curly top and maize streak viruses, did not react {{with any of the}} MAbs. The results of competitive binding tests, when combined with the patterns of reaction of individual MAbs with different viruses, indicated that the MAbs were specific for nine distinct epitopes. Two MAbs reacted with all five whitefly-transmitted viruses, suggesting that the epitopes detected by these MAbs may be important for transmission by B. tabaci. Individual MAbs seem suitable for detecting and identifying ACMV, for distinguishing between ACMV-JI and ACMV-C, and for quantitative assays of other whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of andromonoecious Solanum from the <b>Australian</b> "bush <b>tomato</b> clade" of Solanum {{subgenus}} Leptostemonum is described. Solanum watneyi Martine & Frawley, sp. nov. is closely allied with S. eburneum, and is sympatric with it in parts of its range in the Northern Territory. The new species has been recognized as a variant of S. eburneum for decades, at times being referred to by local botanists as Solanum sp. "Bullita" because of its relative abundance {{in the vicinity of}} the Bullita Station area of Judbarra/Gregory National Park. Morphometric analyses show that S. watneyi differs statistically from S. eburneum in several key reproductive and vegetative characters and field observations suggest that the two sister species may represent a case of edaphic speciation. We provide morphometric evidence for the novelty of S. watneyi, a complete description, and cite specimens for both species...|$|R

40|$|Helicoverpa spp. is {{the primary}} pest in the <b>Australian</b> fresh-market <b>tomato</b> industry. We {{describe}} the spatial distribution of Helicoverpa spp. eggs on fresh-market tomato crops in the Goulburn Valley region of Victoria, and present a sequential sampling plan for monitoring population densities. The distribution of Helicoverpa spp. eggs was highly contagious, as indicated by a Taylor 2 ̆ 7 s b-value of 1. 59. This high level of contagion meant that relatively large sample sizes {{would need to be}} collected to obtain an estimate of population density. High-precision sampling plans generally necessitated impractical sample sizes, and thus the plan we present is a relatively low-precision level plan (SE/mean = 0. 3). Nonetheless, this level of precision is considered adequate for most agronomic scenarios. The plan was validated using a statistical re-sampling approach. The level of precision achieved was generally close to the nominal level. Likewise, the number of samples collected generally showed little departure from the theoretically calculated minimum sample size. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of plants, including most crops, form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). These associations {{play an important}} role in the growth and nutrition of plants. Here we present results from our ongoing research on the role of AM in sustainable production systems. Firstly, we present results of a survey of the formation of AM by field grown tomato plants from across the south-eastern <b>Australian</b> processing <b>tomato</b> industry. This survey revealed low levels of colonisation, which could be explained by various farm management and edaphic factors. Secondly, to explore the role of AM in these farming systems, we grew a mycorrhiza defective tomato mutant and its mycorrhizal wild type progenitor in in-tact cores containing tomato farm soils. This novel genotypic approach to controlling for AM colonization allows us to study the formation and functioning of AM in field soils without the need to fumigate soils to establish non-mycorrhizal controls. Using this approach we found an important role for AM in the nutrition of tomato plants. Given the role of AM in plant nutrition, and the low levels of colonization in the survey, our ongoing research aims to identify better ways to manage AM in the field.

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades there has been much debate about the future of family farming. The basic {{question}} on which this debate has turned is whether current pressures on family farm systems should be understood as symptomatic of a terminal condition, in which farmers are replaced progressively by corporate ownership; or whether family farms will persist as a social formation, albeit increasingly subsumed by off-farm interests. Using evidence from the <b>Australian</b> processing <b>tomato</b> sector, this article documents the changing social and economic formation of 2 ̆ 7 family farming 2 ̆ 7. We argue that in this industry, the appropriate way to describe farmers is through the deployment of that a new category of farming; farm family entrepreneurs. This phrase is coined to describe the situation where family units remain at the social and economic heart of farm ownership and operation, but in the context where they relate to their land-based assets through legal and financial structures characteristic of the wider economy. As this article explores, this formation seems to represent an accommodating modus operandi for farm units within neo-liberal agricultural governance. Nevertheless, however, this duality of family-based structures and capitalist entrepreneurialism inevitably provokes a series of tensions, whose resolution requires a variety of organizational strategies to be put in place.

40|$|New {{crops are}} {{regularly}} being introduced into cultivation, typically {{accompanied by a}} very small agricultural knowledge base. Often, {{there is a lack}} of agronomic research information or production experience upon which to rely, nor plant varieties optimised for an agricultural system. The challenges of a new industry may be compounded by a lack of consumer awareness of the new product and value-chain models need to be developed to suit the product. Frequently the plant species being developed into a new crop is one traditionally used as a food source or for medicinal or other applications by Indigenous people. Thus a complex series of additional factors comes into play – consent of the original custodians, respect and acknowledgement of their traditional knowledge that may be exploited, and totemic, kinship and spiritual associations that may be impacted. Establishing benefit sharing for the hereditary stewards, and protection of traditional collective intellectual property is an important ethical consideration. In the 21 st century, the previous unjust exploitation of the traditional knowledge of the original custodians without acknowledgement or benefit sharing, is no longer accepted. However, prevailing strategies to safeguard intellectual property and traditional knowledge associated with native plants, for instance, to ensure that benefit is captured for Indigenous hereditary custodians may be lacking or may contravene Indigenous customary law. Where scientific, cultural, ethical, legal and commercial issues interact at the emergence of a new crop industry, stakeholders from various perspectives will bring critical, sometimes conflicting, impediments to resolve. The challenges that arise in the commercial exploitation of the <b>Australian</b> Bush <b>Tomato,</b> Solanum centrale, and its horticultural development, are reviewed and the approaches to their resolution are discussed...|$|R
