5|$|Debra, who {{is staying}} at Dexter's apartment, is exercising incessantly and barely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> as she struggles with {{memories}} of Brian, her ex-fiancé, {{trying to kill}} her. She returns {{to work at the}} police station; Sgt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez) expresses concern about her emotional stability, but Debra is determined to resume a normal lifestyle. When she takes Rita out to a bar, a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer. He touches her on the shoulder and she instinctively punches him in the nose, certain {{that he was trying to}} grab her.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{they meet}} a rabbit named Cowslip, who invites {{them to join}} his warren. At first Hazel's group are {{relieved}} to finally be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and feed well – all except for Fiver who senses only death there. When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and feeds the rabbits, but also harvests {{a number of them}} for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E

5000|$|Sweden - In Sweden, {{there is}} no {{counterpart}} to the Bogeyman. The common reference to Monstret under sängen, which essentially means [...] "the monster under the bed", refers to children's own excuses for not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Näcken and Brunnsgubben were previously used to scare children away from wells and dangerous water.|$|R
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> better than he had in weeks.|$|E

Since the mother must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{to provide adequate}} dose, this requires keeping the airway safely open, and close containment to mother’s bare chest using a garment, various of these are described in the WHO guidelines.|$|E
25|$|The poem is twelve {{books with}} the first six dealing with various episodes along with {{introducing}} Hindu theology. The story describes Kehama, a Brahmin priest, as he makes sacrifices to Shiva to gain power. His scheme is to conquer death and attain Amreeta to become a god himself. Arvalan, Kehama's son, attempts to take Kailyal, a peasant girl. He is stopped by Ladurlad, another peasant, and killed. Kehama decides to war against Yamen, the god of death while also seeking to torture Ladurlad in revenge. Ladurlad is cursed {{to be separated from}} nature and unable to live a human life, which included not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> His separation from nature gives him the ability to do what others cannot however.|$|E
25|$|Edward, {{like all}} vampires in the Twilight series, {{possesses}} superhuman stamina, senses, mentality, and agility, {{as well as}} a healing factor and night vision. His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable and tougher than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a pliant daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do so out of habit and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular person. Like other vampires, Edward is not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Fischer and Born, 2009, {{previous}} knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be significant predictors of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks {{that would have to}} be replicated at a later time. The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.|$|E
500|$|Horses are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> both {{standing}} up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a [...] "stay apparatus" [...] in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing. Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.|$|E
500|$|The high {{metabolic}} {{rates of}} birds during the active {{part of the}} day is supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening [...] "peeks", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats. Swifts are believed to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight. It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.|$|E

He listened. The door between the two state rooms was always put open a little way every night, and secured so by the chambermaid, so that either of the children might call to the other if any thing were wanted. It was thus that Rollo heard the sound that came from Jennie's room. After listening a moment, he heard Jennie's voice calling to him.|$|R
5000|$|Circadian rhythm sleep {{disorders}} (CRSD), {{a family of}} {{sleep disorders}}, affecting (among other bodily processes) the timing of sleep. People with circadian rhythm sleep disorders are unable <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and awaken at the times commonly required for work and school {{as well as social}} needs.

500|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{initially}} inspired {{to write this}} episode based on insomnia he was suffering at the time. Gordon, who wrote many episodes with Alex Gansa in season one made his solo writing debut with this episode. Originally Chris Carter had written a script for the first season, which shared the same theme as [...] "Sleepless." [...] The original conceit for Carter's episode was [...] "What makes the perfect soldier?" [...] He also liked the twist on sleep, noting that [...] "sleep is where demons are released in our dreams." [...] He explained that the characters in [...] "Sleepless" [...] were haunted by their memories in real life {{because they were not}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Carter sees this episode as one of his favorites.|$|E

He had read so much of the American girl, her unaffectedness, her genius for easy comradeship. Well, this must be what the writer fellows meant. He had happened upon one of those delightful friendships without any suspicion of sex in them of which the American girl had the monopoly. Yes, that must be it. It was a comforting explanation. It accounted for his feeling at a loose end whenever he was away from Elizabeth for as much as half an hour. It accounted for the fact that they understood each other so well. It accounted for everything so satisfactorily that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> that night after all.|$|R

50|$|The Bear Tribe {{is one of}} {{the tribes}} of Chima that are allied with the Lions. The Bear Tribe are very sleepy and can sleep under any circumstances. Because of this, they sleep through many battles and even fall asleep during Speedorz races. As such, the other tribes often {{consider}} them to be lazy. In fact, the Bears are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use <b>sleep</b> <b>to</b> enter a dream world that allows them {{to communicate with each other}} and the Bear Legend Beast.

When Philippe first saw her, {{he is said}} to have remarked [...] "how will I ever be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with her?" [...] Madame de Sévigné noted how popular the new Madame was with the court. She became renowned for her brusque candor, upright character, and lack of vanity. Her letters record how willingly she gave up sharing Philippe's bed at his request after their children's births and how unwillingly she quietly endured the presence of his male favourites in their household.|$|E
2500|$|Homeostatic sleep {{propensity}} (the {{need for}} sleep {{as a function}} of the amount of time elapsed since the last adequate sleep episode) must be balanced against the circadian element for satisfactory sleep. [...] Along with corresponding messages from the circadian clock, this tells the body it needs to sleep. [...] A person who regularly awakens at an early hour will generally not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> much later than his or her normal waking time, even if moderately sleep-deprived. The timing is correct when the following two circadian markers occur after the middle of the sleep episode and before awakening: maximum concentration of the hormone melatonin, and minimum core body temperature.|$|E
