5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E

He took the existing film, slowed it to half speed, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> dictate the moods, textures, and even running times of the songs he wrote to it. The resulting album is titled Graveyard Mountain Home, which included a DVD containing the movie set to Moore's music.|$|E

The Orontes is joined in Antakya by the Hacı Kürüş stream to the north-east of the city near the church of St Peter, and the Hamşen which runs down from Habib-i Neccar to the south-west, under Memekli Bridge near the army barracks. Flora includes the bay trees and myrtle. There is a Jewish community.|$|E
25|$|Korolev {{proposed}} communications {{satellites and}} a modified Vostok useful for photographic reconnaissance to quiet Soviet military objections {{about the cost}} of planetary and manned programs of no perceived value for national defense. Korolev planned to move forward with Soyuz craft able to dock with other craft in orbit and exchange crews. He was directed by Khrushchev to cheaply produce more 'firsts' for the piloted program, including a multi-manned flight. Korolev was reported to have resisted the idea as the Vostok was a one-man spacecraft and the three-man Soyuz was several years away from being able to fly. Khrushchev was not interested in technical excuses <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that if Korolev could not do it, he would give the work to his rival, Vladimir Chelomei.|$|E
25|$|The text of {{the first}} of the three books of the Principia was {{presented}} to the Royal Society at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go forward to publication. Samuel Pepys, as President, gave his imprimatur on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had just spent its book budget on a History of Fishes, and the cost of publication was borne by Edmund Halley (who was also then acting as publisher of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society): the book appeared in summer 1687.|$|E

25|$|As alchemy {{evolved into}} the science of chemistry, vessels called retorts became used for distillations. Both alembics and retorts are forms of {{glassware}} with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle which acted as air-cooled condensers to condense the distillate <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour. These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called pot stills. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols such as cognac, Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, tequila and some vodkas. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by bootleggers in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for the domestic production of flower water or essential oils.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, as many rock artists moved towards {{expansive}} {{and experimental}} psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival {{when he went}} to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde, using notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians. Other acts that followed the back to basics trend in different ways were the Canadian/American group The Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George. The back to basics tendency would also be evident in the Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet (1968) and Exile on Main Street (1972), the Beatles' The White Album (1968) <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> Be (1970)., The Doors' Morrison Hotel (1970) and L.A.
