5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
25|$|On 9 August 1999 Yeltsin {{fired his}} prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, {{and for the}} fourth time, fired his entire cabinet. In Stepashin's place he {{appointed}} Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor. In late 1999 Yeltsin <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> openly disagreed {{on the war in}} Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed his finger at Yeltsin and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. Yeltsin immediately left the conference.|$|E

25|$|The IOM {{called for}} a broad {{national}} effort to include establishment of a Center for Patient Safety, expanded reporting of adverse events, development of safety programs in health care organizations, and attention by regulators, health care purchasers, and professional societies. The majority of media attention, however, focused on the staggering statistics: from 44,000 to 98,000 preventable deaths annually due to medical error in hospitals, 7,000 preventable deaths related to medication errors alone. Within 2 weeks of the report's release, Congress began hearings <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> ordered a government-wide study of the feasibility of implementing the report's recommendations.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{the city}} council passed a {{resolution}} to petition the US Congress <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> to restrict US immigration. Aspen residents cited concerns about {{the environmental impacts of}} increased immigration on their community, including urban and suburban sprawl, pollution from the older automobiles typically driven by immigrants, and litter accumulating in the mountains attributable to the increasing population. The impetus for the resolution was the increasing number of trailer parks that housed the migrant workers employed locally in the service sector and ski industry. The parks were perceived to be degrading to the town's image, property values, and environment. The move was led by Terry Paulson, an Aspen City Council member, and supported and guided by national groups such as the Carrying Capacity Network, and the Center for Immigration Studies. The resolution was discussed on the American Patrol Report website, contributing to a controversy over whether or not the resolution was racially motivated. Councilman Terry Paulson and some Aspen citizens insisted that it was motivated entirely by environmental concerns.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{returned}} to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the Los Angeles Times {{asked a question}} about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said [...] "distorted the comment" [...] with headlines such as [...] "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" [...] in The New York Times. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a [...] "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts," [...] <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> agreed that Clark's remarks were misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim: [...] "Get your fucking face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That's it." ...|$|E

500|$|The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee {{issued its}} {{majority}} report on September 18, 1996, {{in which it}} accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal. [...] It portrayed Bill Clinton as being heavily involved in the travel office affair, {{more than any other}} investigation. [...] The report's chapter titles were lurid: [...] "The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House Travel Office Firings and Related Matters", [...] "The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of the Travel Office Firings <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle", [...] "Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration", and so forth. [...] Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it [...] "an embarrassment to you , this committee and this Congress" [...] and [...] "a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and this administration." [...] The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. [...] Democrats said this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996presidential election.|$|E

[...] She added: [...] "I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened." [...] However, {{she said it was}} now time to [...] "stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past." [...] The magazine later announced her as a Vanity Fair contributor, stating she would [...] "contribute to their website on an ongoing basis, on the lookout for relevant topics of interest".|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 the Congress enacted <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{signed into}} law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, {{also known as the}} Financial Services Modernization Act. This law {{repealed}} the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933. A similar bill was introduced in 1998 by Senator Phil Gramm but it was unable to complete the legislative process into law. Resistance to enacting the 1998 bill, as well as the subsequent 1999 bill, centered around the legislation's language which would expand the types of banking institutions of the time into other areas of service but would not be subject to CRA compliance in order to do so. The Senator also demanded full disclosure of any financial [...] "deals" [...] which community groups had with banks, accusing such groups of [...] "extortion".|$|E

Clinton and Gore spent the day at Ygnacio Valley High School, as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the Internet. In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his {{challenge}} the previous September to [...] "Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the Information Superhighway {{by the end of this}} school year" [...] was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of [...] "absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of Americans has ever seen." [...] In a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the Clinton administration, which was [...] "to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century." [...] Gore also stated that the administration planned [...] "to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000." [...] On April 28, 1998, Gore honored numerous volunteers who had been involved with NetDay and [...] "who helped connect students to the Internet in 700 of the poorest schools in the country" [...] via [...] "an interactive online session with children across the country." ...|$|E
