Samples were alternately weathered in a freeze -thaw cycle chamber, tested for water repellency and structural stability against water erosion, then subjected to more weathering, etc., until sample failure occurred. Soils treated with candelilla/paraffin wax mixtures were much more resistant to laboratory freeze -thaw cycle weathering than those soils treated with either of the waxes alone. Weatherability was further improved, and wax requirement reduced by (1) prior stabilization of the soil with cellulose xanthate made from chemically pulped waste paper; (2) incorporating 28 of a commercial <b>antistripping</b> <b>agent</b> into the wax; and (3) substituting a residual type petroleum wax for the paraffin in the wax mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{damage in}} asphalt {{pavement}} {{has always been}} a problem for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate moisture susceptibility of Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) and to investigate mitigation techniques using different antistripping agents. Three types of antistripping agents were used in this research investigation. Two of which are chemical based and the other is hydrated lime. The two types of liquid antistripping agents used in this study include Arr Maz CC LOF- 6500 and Arr Maz CC XL- 9000. These two liquid antistripping agents were tested at 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, and 0. 75 %. Hydrated Lime was tested at 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 %. The binder used in this study is Asphalt Performance Grade (PG) 64 - 16 provided by Oxnard Refinery. The crushed stone aggregate used in this study was provided by Cal Portland. This study follows the guidelines of standardized AASHTO, ASTM, and SuperPave mix design for all preparation and test procedures. A total of 120 4 -inch by 2. 83 -inch core specimens with void ratios between 6 to 8 percent were created to test for moisture susceptibility in accordance with the Modified Lottman Test, which tested for Indirect Tensile Strength and Immersion Compression Test, which tested for Compression Strength and Elasticity. During the test, half of these specimens were placed in a hot water bath for 24 hours to condition the sample to represent field performance and the other half were unconditioned. Based on the results, the best liquid <b>antistripping</b> <b>agent</b> is XL- 9000 at 0. 50 % and hydrated lime is most efficient at a dosage rate of 1. 5 %. The best performing antistripping additive for the value is hydrated lime at 1. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{damage is}} one of the major {{problems}} of asphalt pavements in United States. The moisture damage problem in asphalt has been studied for decades; still it remains an unsolved problem. Traditional macro-scale tests and methods failed to describe how and what factors affect moisture damage because moisture damage in asphalt is related to asphalt chemistry and adhesion characteristics, which are below micron scale phenomena. To this end, asphalt chemistry and adhesion values are studied at nano-scale to understand moisture damage in this study. Nano-scale measurements are conducted using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) in the laboratory. In an AFM test, adhesion forces of dry and wet asphalt samples are measured by probing the sample surface with AFM tips. Nano-scale pull-off force or adhesion between sample molecules and tip molecules are measured. To facilitate the study of asphalt chemistry, AFM tips are modified using chemical functional groups such as carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), ammin (-NH 3) and methyl (-CH 3), representing the chemistry of asphalt binder. Thus functionalized tips facilitate the measurement of adhesion within the asphalt binder. In addition, silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) tips are used. Silicon nitride resembles aggregate molecules (e. g. silica aggregate) that are used to produce asphalt concrete or pavements. Thus adhesion value measured using a silicon nitride tip can be considered as the adhesion value of asphalt-aggregate interface. It is shown in this study that the adhesion within the asphalt binder varies depending on the chemistry of asphalt. AFM testing on asphalt is non-trivial and very challenging as AFM tips stick to the asphalt surface due to the viscous and soft nature of asphalt binder. AFM testing also requires smooth surface of a test sample. This study has developed a methodology for asphalt sample preparation for AFM testing. Simply, pouring asphalt binder on a glass substrate and melting to free flow and then cooling it generates an AFM asphalt sample with a root mean square surface roughness below 10 nm. Such sample surface is smooth enough for AFM testing. Through trial and error, this study has calibrated a set of AFM testing parameters that are suitable for successful adhesion measurement in asphalt binder. In all cases, a set of AFM samples are tested under dry condition, and a set of identical samples are tested after wet conditioning. Polymer is almost an essential component of asphalt binders now-a-days. However it is not known whether polymer modification helps reduce moisture damage potential of asphalt. Therefore, both base binder and polymer modified asphalt binder are characterized herein using AFM. Two common polymers Styrene-Butadyne (SB) and Styrene-Butadyne-Styrene (SBS) are used to modify the base asphalt. The goal is to examine whether polymer modification helps reduce moisture damage at nano-scale. In addition to polymer, a chemical modifier known as Elvaloy is included in this study to examine whether Elvaloy is more effective than polymer in regards to moisture damage. It is shown that both base and modified asphalt binders are vulnerable to moisture damage to some degree. However, base binder is the most susceptible to moisture damage among all the binders. It is evident that the SB polymer modification of asphalt is good for interface adhesion, whereas the SBS polymer modification is good for achieving higher adhesion within the asphalt binder. Antistripping agents are commonly used to reduce moisture damage potential of an asphalt binder. A number of antistripping agents are available in the market. However, it is not know which antistripping works better than others. To examine, five common antistripping agents such as lime, klingbeta, wetfix, morlife and unichem are considered for AFM testing in this study. It is evident from this study that moisture damage occurs in asphalt binder having an <b>antistripping</b> <b>agent.</b> Hydrated lime provides higher moisture damage resistance to asphalt binders that the liquid antistripping agents such as morlife, unichem, klingbeta, and wetfix. Statistical analysis of the adhesion test results is performed. Based on Pearson’s p-value (significance test), it is concluded that the adhesion value measure by an AFM varies with the type and amount of <b>antistripping</b> <b>agent</b> present in an asphalt sample. Finally, an attempt is made to correlate nano-scale adhesion value of an asphalt binder to macro-scale strength value representing moisture damage. Only polymer modified binders are considered for examining such correlations. Macro-scale indirect tension tests are conducted on wet and dry asphalt concrete samples. A good correlation exists between the macro-scale indirect tensile strength ratio, and nano-scale adhesion ratio of wet and dry samples.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{evaluates the}} role of <b>antistripping</b> <b>agents</b> to resist moisture-induced damage in asphalt binders. A total of five {{different}} types of <b>antistripping</b> <b>agents</b> are used. Plastomer and elastomer modified asphalt binders are used to modify the original base binder. Functionalized and non-functionalized AFM tips are used to determine adhesion in asphalt. With-CH 3 tip, lime {{is found to be}} the most effective to protect moisture damage in asphalt binder as the adhesion loss is almost zero. The statistical tests show the Pearson values are very close to- 1 that indicates a good correlation among the variables. Also the p-values are well below the prescribed value of 0. 2 % that indicates the test results to be significant from the statistical point of view...|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} certain classes of organic {{compounds}} known variously {{in the specific}} literature of asphalt as adhesion promoters, <b>antistripping</b> <b>agents,</b> wetting <b>agents,</b> <b>antistrips,</b> or adhesion <b>agents.</b> These kinds of organic additives are currently formulated to enhance the bitumen coating of mineral aggregates and improve the workability of asphalt mixtures. In this review, the term “adhesion promoters” includes both synthetic organic compounds {{as well as those}} extracted from natural resources, mixed in trace amounts to bitumen. Their main role is to alter the interfacial energy, so that the presence of water, even in trace, does not weaken the bitumen-aggregate bond and tends to favor adhesion. The report also considers the chemical functionalities that play a predominant role in bonding, as well as the effects of surface modification of the aggregate due to the presence of adhesion promoters in pre-blended bituminous mixtures. Although bitumen is widely used in road pavement construction and the discussion is mainly addressed to the improvement of adhesion in road materials, adhesion and wetting properties can also represent a general issue in various bitumen-based industrial products...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Neural Network (NN) {{model is}} {{developed}} to quantify nano-level adhesion force of moisture damaged asphalt binder using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) test data. AFM data contains five point force-distance values determined for some specific asphalt chemical functional groups. Asphalt binder samples contain different types and percentages of polymer modifiers and antistripping agents (ASA). Due to complex and nonlinear {{interaction between the}} asphalt properties and adhesion force of asphalt, {{it is difficult to}} assess the effects of asphalt binder properties on the adhesion forces using laboratory AFM testing. NN has the ability to recognize and trace the complex relationship trend existing between inputs and outputs; therefore NN is chosen to be used {{for the development of the}} model in this study. Two neural network models are developed, one for lime treated and another for chemical <b>antistripping</b> <b>agent</b> treated asphalt samples. To train the network, AFM tip-sample distance data, percentage of lime, type and percentage of polymer and asphalt chemical functional groups are considered as inputs and AFM force as an output. On the basis of performance, 12 - 9 - 16 - 3 and 11 - 25 - 25 - 5 NN are selected as the final structure of models for lime and chemical antistripping agents treated asphalt samples respectively. The models show good agreement with the laboratory data for both models. To this end, the developed models are used to predict adhesion of both lime treated and chemical antistripping agents treated dry and wet asphalt for same inputs. This allows observing the effect of lime and chemical additives in resisting adhesion loss due to moisture conditioning thus moisture damage of bond forces of asphalt. NN induced results show that lime performs better in resisting moisture effect for samples containing 3 % SB polymer compared to other polymer modified samples. Also, lime fails to resist the degradation of adhesion force in wet sample determined by silicon nitride tip for all types of modified asphalt samples. Among all the chemical ASAs, Morlife shows best performance in presence of 3 % SB and 3 and 5 % SBS in reducing moisture effect on adhesion and cohesion bond forces of asphalt at nano-level. In all cases, increase in percentage of additives above 1 % does not aid in resistance to moisture damage. National Science FoundationCivil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|In this study, {{moisture}} {{damage in}} plastomeric polymer modified asphalt binder is investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) with chemically functionalized AFM tips. Four different percentages of plastomeric polymers and two <b>antistripping</b> <b>agents</b> such as Kling Beta and Lime {{are used to}} modify a base asphalt binder. Chemical functional groups such as -COOH, -CH 3, -NH 3, and –OH, that are commonly present in plastomeric polymer modified asphalt system, are used to functionalize the AFM tips. The force distance mode of AFM is {{used to measure the}} adhesion forces between a modified asphalt sample surface and the functionalized AFM tips. This enables the measurement of adhesion within an asphalt binder system. It is shown that the adhesion force values in dry sample changed substantially from that in wet conditioned samples. It is evident from this study that plastomeric modification does not help reduce moisture damage in asphalt. The percentage change in adhesion forces due to moisture is about 20 nN for the lime modified samples, and about 50 nN for the Kling Beta modified samples. This indicates that lime is more effective than Kling Beta for reducing moisture damage in plastomeric polymer modified asphalt...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{damage is}} the {{progressive}} deterioration of asphalt mixes by {{loss of adhesion}} between asphalt binder and aggregate surface and/or loss of cohesion within the binder due to water. It is a complex phenomenon affected {{by a variety of}} factors, and has not been fully understood in the pavement community with major knowledge gaps in three areas: major contributing factors to moisture damage in the field, appropriate laboratory test procedures, and the effectiveness of treatments. Both field investigation and laboratory investigation were performed in this study to fill up some of the major gaps. Statewide condition survey and field sampling were conducted to identify factors contributing to moisture damage. Statistical analysis revealed that air-void content, mix type, pavement structure, cumulative rainfall, and pavement age significantly affect the extent of moisture damage. Laboratory experiments revealed that high air-void contents not only allow more moisture to enter mixes, but also significantly reduce the fatigue resistance of mixes wet conditions. Reduction in the binder content from the optimum binder content may significantly reduce the moisture resistance of asphalt mixes under repeated loading. The effectiveness of Hamburg wheel tracking device (HWTD) test to determine moisture sensitivity of asphalt mixes was evaluated by both laboratory prepared specimens and field cores. Results revealed that the current test procedure does not clearly distinguish mixes with different moisture sensitivities. The test tends to overestimate the performance of mixes containing conventional binders and underestimate the performance of mixes containing polymer modified binders. Several ways to improve the prediction accuracy of the HWTD test were suggested. As a new approach of testing, a fatigue based test procedure for evaluating moisture sensitivity was explored in this study. A typical test procedure was determined for comparative evaluation of different mixes, which is a controlled-strain flexural beam fatigue test performed at 20 °C, 10 Hz and 200 με on specimens pre-saturated under 635 mm-Hg vacuum for 30 minutes and preconditioned at 60 °C for one day. An extension of the test procedure for use in the pavement design was also discussed. The long-term effectiveness of both hydrated lime and liquid <b>antistripping</b> <b>agents</b> in improving the moisture resistance of asphalt mixes was evaluated by both the tensile strength ratio (TSR) test and the fatigue beam test. Results showed that both treatments are effective even after one year’s moisture conditioning...|$|R
