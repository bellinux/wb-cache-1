40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (1) cal-culate age-specific and age-adjusted cause-specific mor-tality rates for Arab Americans; and (2) compare these rates with those for <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites. Mortality rates were estimated using Michigan death certificate data, an Arab surname and first name list, and 2000 U. S. Census data. Age-specific rates, age-adjusted all-cause and cause-spe-cific rates were calculated. Arab Americans (75 ?) had higher mortality rates than whites <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> Among men, all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for Arab Americans were in the range of whites <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> How-ever, Arab American men had lower mortality rates from cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease compared to both whites <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> Among women, Arab Americans had lower mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes than whites <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> Arab Americans are growing in number. Future study should focus on designing rigorous separate analyses for this population...|$|R
