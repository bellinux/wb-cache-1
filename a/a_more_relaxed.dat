It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at Avast studio in Seattle, Washington in July 1998. The Hot Rock marks a considerable change in the band's sound, veering into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>relaxed</b> and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. The lyrical themes of the album explore issues of failed relationships and personal uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not extensive, {{and knowledge of the}} daily lives of the population is lacking. It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>relaxed</b> political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} of any direct Norwegian rule in the area other than a few brief occupations although the written record is weak and no contemporary records of the Norse period from the Outer Hebrides exist.

5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer enjoyed his cricket, and in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>relaxed</b> setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at {{seven in the morning}} to avoid the worst of the heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win.|$|E

5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane got too close and his propeller sliced through Dutton's tailplane. Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this had caused the collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>relaxed</b> atmosphere, which he believed would help him get more out of the Australian pilots. He was now in command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{at the age}} of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was {{admitted}} to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>relaxed</b> regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.|$|E

25|$|A peak-sensing {{compressor}} {{responds to}} the instantaneous level of the input signal. While providing tighter peak control, peak sensing might yield very quick changes in gain reduction, more evident compression or sometimes even distortion. Some compressors apply an averaging function (commonly root mean square or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>relaxed</b> compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness.|$|E
25|$|Music therapy {{comes in}} two {{different}} forms: active and receptive.

This allows for the patient to be creative and expressive through the art of music. Receptive therapy takes place in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>relaxed</b> setting where the therapist plays or makes music to the patient who is free to draw, listen or meditate. Usually the therapist determines the method unless specifically requested by the patient.|$|E

25|$|Colonial artisanship emerged {{slowly as}} the market for {{advanced}} craftsmanship was small.

Despite the fact that mercantilist, export-heavy economy impaired {{the emergence of a}} robust self-sustaining economy, craftsman and merchants developed a growing interdependence on each other for their trades. In the mid-18th century, attempts by the British to subdue or control the colonies by means of taxation sowed increased discontent among these artisans, who increasingly joined the Patriot cause.|$|E
