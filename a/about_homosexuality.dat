5|$|The social {{repression}} of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality.</b> Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E
5|$|With a seed {{grant from}} Steven Spielberg, {{the creators of}} the film have set up the Trembling Before G-d Orthodox Education Project, to teach Orthodox {{educators}} and rabbis <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality,</b> as well as convening the first Orthodox Mental Health Conference on Homosexuality and training facilitators to show the film to community leaders. Over 2000 principals, educators and school counselors have attended screenings within Israel's religious school system. The film has now been seen by an estimated 8 million people worldwide. Following the success of Trembling before G-d, DuBowski produced a documentary about gay devout Muslims entitled A Jihad for Love.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the lack}} of {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality</b> in scholarly texts, another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing. A paperback book titled Women's Barracks describing a woman's experiences in the Free French Forces was published in 1950. It told of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Its publisher, Gold Medal Books, followed with the novel Spring Fire in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the subject matter, and followed with more books, creating the genre of lesbian pulp fiction.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 {{of a decision}} on plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} was interpreted as an attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality,</b> and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E

25|$|Lee next {{answered}} a question <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality</b> at a Young PAP meeting in 2007. The questioner was Loretta Chen, an openly lesbian young PAP member and a bilingual theatre director in Singapore. She {{asked if the}} current censorship rules in Singapore were too equivocal and where censorship was headed {{in the next two}} decades. Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress Annabel Chong, which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality was a product of nature or nurture. He replied that he had asked doctors <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality</b> and had been told that it was caused by a genetic random transmission of genes.|$|E

25|$|Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry is a 1988 book by {{the philosopher}} Michael Ruse, {{in which the}} author surveys {{different}} theories of homosexuality and evaluates the moral status of homosexual behavior. Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry received a mixture {{of positive and negative}} reviews. Some reviewers praised the book for Ruse's comprehensive treatment of his subject, careful discussion of theories <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality,</b> and use of philosophy to argue in favor of gay rights. However, Ruse's discussion of psychoanalytic and sociobiological theories, and his use of historical evidence to discuss homosexuality in past societies, were criticized, and commentators also suggested that some of Ruse's comments <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality</b> could be seen as insensitive. Some reviewers suggested that Ruse's arguments and conclusions were influenced by his personal reaction to the AIDS epidemic.|$|E

25|$|It remains unclear, what exact {{view the}} ancient Egyptians fostered <b>about</b> <b>homosexuality.</b> Any {{document}} and literature that actually contains sexual orientated stories, never name {{the nature of}} the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. No ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.|$|E
