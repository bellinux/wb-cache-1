500|$|I have {{demonstrated}} on myself in an injury occasioned by a fall, that it [...] {{did for me}} what surgeons could not do. Dr. Cushing of this city pronounced my injury incurable <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not survive three days because of it, when {{on the third day}} I rose from my bed and to the utter confusion of all I commenced my usual avocations and notwithstanding displacements, etc., I regained the natural position and functions of the body.|$|E
500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E
60|$|I forgot {{everything}} except that I loved Jack Willoughby, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never, never marry {{anybody in the}} world except him.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{what you}} mean when you tell me I am not wise. I tried it,--with all the power of thought <b>and</b> {{calculation}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give to it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not marry Mr. Gilmore." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> hesitated <b>and</b> wished <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get away; but Lady Silchester was {{standing}} immediately {{in front of}} me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{forget the}} mockers <b>and</b> insults! [...] <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forget the {{trickling}} tears and the blows of the [...] bludgeons <b>and</b> hammers! [...] <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> look {{with a separate}} look on my own crucifixion and [...] bloody crowning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{and tell}} her so. Make her {{understand}} that she should put herself into my hands at once, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> protect her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not tell}} them {{anything}} of the sort. I told them that I accepted their proposal, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> answer for your accepting it too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate gallantry; {{it is all}} bosh. I wish I were a man, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{call you}} Bertram, and that you would call me Cox." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{shook my}} head <b>and</b> said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not, <b>and</b> next moment was sorry, for she {{proceeded}} to explain.|$|R
6000|$|I swayed {{upon the}} gaudy stern [...] The butt {{end of a}} {{steering}} oar, [...] <b>And</b> everywhere <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> turn [...] Men ran upon the shore.|$|R
6000|$|The Altrurian {{looked so}} blank <b>and</b> baffled <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly help laughing. [...] "Then I should {{not know how}} to explain Altruria to you, I'm afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Curse you, I {{have wished}} {{a hundred million}} times that you were tangible, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get my hands on}} your throat once! Oh, but I will wreak a deadly vengeance on--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that was not my character, Mr. Cathro; but I hope I have changed since then, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pull a boy {{out of the water}} without wanting to be extolled for it." ...|$|E
60|$|FERROVIUS (picking up a sword) I'll die {{sword in}} hand {{to show people}} that I could fight if it were my Master's will, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> kill the man who kills me if I chose.|$|E
60|$|Here Kari {{looked at}} me, of whom I {{knew he was}} {{thinking}} all this time, <b>and</b> seeing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> overhear his talk, began to speak of something else.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be {{considerable}} hoist in it," [...] he said, directly. And then I {{put my arms around}} him, <b>and</b> found <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> raise him from the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very terrible. Ah, dear, I have hardly {{yet found}} out how sad it is. As yet I have only been {{thinking}} of myself, <b>and</b> wishing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said I, [...] "permit me {{to remark}} {{that the greater}} the danger the greater the glory, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only repent of {{volunteering}} if I {{found that there were}} no risks to be run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pshaw!' cries Berenger; 'have you {{not heard}} {{that it was}} a mere figment, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarce have wedded Lucy safely, even had this matter gone as you wish? This is the luckiest chance that could have befallen her.' ...|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS. I {{remember}} that deplorable impertinence with shame and confusion. You were {{kind enough to}} answer that Mr Collins was looking out for a clever young man to write advertisements, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take the job if I liked.|$|E
6000|$|Peter came {{to himself}} with a start. [...] "No," [...] said he. [...] "I was just {{listening}} <b>and</b> wishing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sing, too. Don't you ever wish you could sing, Jimmy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't I have Demi {{come up to}} tea alone {{just this}} one time? <b>And</b> after <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cook things for the others if they were good," [...] {{proposed}} Daisy, with a sudden inspiration.|$|R
6000|$|... “I am {{not asking}} you to, mademoiselle; I am only saying {{how it could be}} managed, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get back to England I might aid your lover.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the truth, sir," [...] said Barrymore. [...] "I {{said that}} it was not my secret <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not tell it to you. But now you have heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you." ...|$|E
60|$|Here, again, is {{a little}} bit to show Carpaccio's execution. It is his signature: only a little wall-lizard, holding the paper in its mouth, perfect; yet so small that you can {{scarcely}} see its feet, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not, with my finest-pointed brush, copy their stealthy action.|$|E
6000|$|O for one {{midnight and}} as paramour The Venus {{of the little}} Melian farm! O that some antique statue for one hour Might wake to passion, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> charm The Dawn at Florence from its dumb despair, Mix with those mighty limbs and make that giant breast my lair! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} be {{so in love with}} Italy, {{especially}} with Naples <b>and</b> Venice, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have been very well satisfied to have sent for Amy and have taken up my residence there for life.|$|R
60|$|She put her hand--its touch {{was like}} no other hand--upon my arm for a moment; and I felt so befriended <b>and</b> comforted, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help moving it to my lips, and gratefully kissing it.|$|R
6000|$|... '2 P.M. - Hurrah, he is hooked, the big fellow, {{almost at}} the first cast. He hangs under our bows looking so huge <b>and</b> {{imposing}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find it in my heart {{to be afraid of}} him.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought for}} a moment. It {{was not a very}} long absence, but the new sights would {{distract}} me, and I wanted to see Florence again. On the whole, I thought it would suffice, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> count on the cure of my ill before the time was up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Monsieur Kennedy," [...] he said, {{after the}} {{ceremony}} of presentation had been completed; [...] "I wish that I had all my faithful subjects, of the Irish Brigade, across the water with me; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> put on a uniform like yours, and fight at their head for my rights." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{tears were}} in my eyes before, they flowed too fast now to be restrained, and I gave him but too much {{satisfaction}} by my looks that I had yet no reflections upon my mind strong enough to go that length, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> no more think of parting than he could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly; I {{found him}} {{drawing on a}} barn-door with such zeal <b>and</b> spirit, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help {{offering}} him some lessons. Only see, does he not get on? <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get him to the school of design." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry bent towards Nyleptha <b>and</b> whispered {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not catch, <b>and</b> {{then the}} Queen spoke.|$|R
60|$|First I complimented Charley on the room, {{and indeed}} it was so fresh and airy, so spotless <b>and</b> neat, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarce believe <b>I</b> had been lying there so long. This delighted Charley, {{and her face was}} {{brighter}} than before.|$|R
