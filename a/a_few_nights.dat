5|$|After his {{accession}} to the throne, King Rama VI occasionally {{stayed at the}} palace. King Rama VII stayed at the palace for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights</b> before his coronation in 1925, while King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) made the palace his main place of residence upon his return to Thailand from Switzerland in December 1945. He lived in this palace with his younger brother Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej (later King Rama IX) and his mother Princess Sri Sangwan. On the morning of 9 June 1946 the palace bore witness to his mysterious and unexplained death by gunshot. King Rama IX later refurbished the palace and added an extra wing extending south.|$|E

5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, lasted only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights,</b> {{it was the}} start of his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{agreed to}} re-sign with the Lakers on July 2, 2012 {{and was named}} to the Lakers team for the July 1322 Las Vegas NBA Summer League. During the Summer League, Morris led the Lakers in scoring and assists. On November 9, 2012, Darius Morris {{recorded}} 10 points, a career-high 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 steal in a 10177 Lakers win over the Golden State, backing up Blake, while Steve Nash was injured. On November 13, with both Blake and Nash injured, Morris made his first career start against the San Antonio Spurs. As a starter, Morris posted career highs of 31 minutes and 6 assists on November 16 against the Phoenix Suns. On December 4, Chris Duhon overtook Morris as the replacement starter. On December 16, Morris posted a career-high 15 points against the Philadelphia 76ers. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights</b> later, Kobe Bryant praised him for his defensive effort. When Nash returned to the starting lineup on December 22, Morris started in place of Metta World Peace, who came off the bench. This was part of a common strategy employed by Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni to play players out of position. While a starter, Morris' responsibility was to defend against the opponents' most dangerous perimeter player. On January 4, World Peace returned to the starting lineup in Morris' place. Then in late January, Jodie Meeks replaced Morris in the rotation as Blake also returned to the rotation.|$|E

25|$|All {{but one of}} {{the marine}} turtles come to the Mazunte area to lay their eggs, as well as a few land and {{freshwater}} turtle species. The Pacific coast town of Mazunte is famous for its sea turtles. Thousands of Olive Ridley turtles arrive en masse to lay their eggs in nearby Escobilla Bay. The nesting season generally begins in May and lasts for several months. Although an endangered species, the turtles come to the beach in large numbers for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights</b> after a full moon. These events are called arribadas. Other turtles that lay eggs here are the Hawksbill turtle, the “prieta” (a subspecies of green turtle), and some leatherback turtles. In 1997, The Centro Mexicano de Tortuga counted the arrival of about 900,000 sea turtles to La Escobilla beach alone.|$|E
25|$|Gwaihir set Gandalf down in Rohan, where Gandalf {{appealed to}} King Théoden for a horse. Théoden, under the malign {{influence}} of Gríma Wormtongue, Saruman's spy, told Gandalf {{to take any}} horse he pleased, but to leave quickly. It was then that Gandalf met the great horse Shadowfax, one of the mearas, who would be his mount and companion {{for most of the}} rest of the war. Gandalf pursued the horse for two days before Shadowfax permitted Gandalf to ride him. Gandalf then rode hard for the Shire, but did not reach it until Frodo had already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions would be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf began to make his own way there. He learned at Bree that the Hobbits had fallen in with Aragorn. He faced the Nazgûl at Weathertop but escaped after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward. Frodo, Aragorn and company faced the remaining five on Weathertop <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights</b> later. Gandalf reached Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.|$|E

25|$|Where the {{presence}} of burrowing owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations need to start several {{months prior to the}} anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good burrowing owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to be interested in the location – if possible, this should be at the onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way trapdoor design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose. If everything has been correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site in the course of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights</b> at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.|$|E

At a private party, Max saves Rodrigo and his trophy wife Fabiana (Benedita Pereira) from an attempted kidnapping {{by members of the}} Comando Sombra, a favela street gang. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights</b> later, as Max escorts Fabiana and her friends to a nightclub, the gang attacks again, successfully kidnapping Fabiana and demanding a ransom of $3 million. Max and Passos deliver the ransom to a local football stadium to make the exchange, but the deal is disrupted by the Crachá Preto, an outlaw, right-wing paramilitary unit, who kill the Comando Sombra and steal the money. After escaping the stadium, Max and Passos raid a Comando Sombra base along the Tiete river to rescue Fabiana, but are unable to prevent the gang's leader, Serrano, from escaping with her. After they report their failure to the Brancos, Victor suggests they rely on Armando Becker (Ubirajara de Castro) and his special police unit Unidade de Forças Especiais (UFE) to oversee Fabiana's safe return. Victor, Passos, Marcelo and Becker leave via helicopter, moments before the Crachá Preto abruptly raid the Branco offices.|$|E
25|$|Non–Jewish Poles {{provided}} {{assistance to}} the Jews in an organised fashion {{as well as through}} varying degrees of individual efforts. Many Poles offered food to Polish Jews and left food in places Jews would pass on their way to forced labour. Others, directed Jews who managed to escape from the ghettosto Polish people who could help them. Some sheltered Jews for only one or <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>nights,</b> others assumed full responsibility for the Jews' survival, well aware that the Nazis punished those who helped Jews by summary killings. A special role fell to the Polish medical doctors who alone saved thousands of Jews through their subversive practise. For example, Dr. Eugeniusz Łazowski, known as Polish 'Schindler', saved 8,000 Polish Jews from deportation to death camps, by faking an epidemic of typhus in the town of Rozwadów. Free medicine was given out in the Kraków Ghetto by Tadeusz Pankiewicz saving unspecified number of Jews. Rudolf Weigl employed and protected Jews in his Institute in Lwów. His vaccines were smuggled into the local ghetto as well as the ghetto in Warsaw saving countless lives. Dr. Tadeusz Kosibowicz, director of the state hospital in Będzin was sentenced to death for rescuing Jewish fugitives. It is mostly those who took full responsibility who qualify for the title of the Righteous Among the Nations. To date, a total of 6,066 Poles have been officially recognized by Israel as the Polish Righteous among the Nations for their efforts in saving Polish Jews during the Holocaust, making Poland the country with the highest number of Righteous in the world.|$|E
