40|$|PURPOSE. Established {{techniques}} for culturing primary human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have facilitated the laboratory investigation of this multipurpose retinal cell layer. However, most culture methods involve {{the use of}} animal serum {{to establish and maintain}} RPE monolayers, which can complicate efforts to define and study factors involved in the maturation and function of these cells. Therefore, this study was conducted to develop a simple, serum-free system to propagate and sustain human RPE in vitro. METHODS. RPE was dissected from human prenatal donor eyes and cultured in serum-free defined medium containing the commercially formulated supplement B 27 or N 2.

40|$|The actin {{cytoskeleton}} of <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> cells often condenses into filament bundles contracted by myosin motors, so-called stress fibers, which play {{a crucial}} role in the mechanical interaction of cells with their environment. Stress fibers are usually attached to their environment at the endpoints, but possibly also along their whole length. We introduce a theoretical model for such contractile filament bundles which combines passive viscoelasticity with active contractility. The model equations are solved analytically for two different types of boundary conditions. A free boundary corresponds to stress fiber contraction dynamics after laser surgery and results in good agreement with experimental data. Imposing cyclic varying boundary forces allows us to calculate the complex modulus of a single stress fiber.

40|$|We have {{produced}} images of whole wet tissue culture cells with the Stony Brook/BNL scanning transmission x-ray microscope (STXM). For fixed cells {{we have taken}} images at theoretical resolutions of ~ 50 - 75 nm, and in practice have measured FWHM of features down to near 100 nm, without any exotic image processing. For un-fixed (i. e., initially live) cells we have imaged with 100 nm pixels and measured features down to 250 nm. In order to do this we have developed, tested, and used a wet cell for maintaining fixed or live cells on the STXM stage during imaging. Our design of the wet cell and the culture substrates that go with it make the STXM compatible with almost all standard systems for surface <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> culture. We show some new images of whole wet fixed and unfixed cells, with visible sub-micron features. We also report data that helps to characterize the tissue damage due to x-ray absorption during STXM imaging...|$|E

40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} (EGFR, erbB 1) activation and translocation of the Shc adaptor protein to activated receptors were analyzed at the subcellular level by dual-label immunofluorescence and confocal {{laser scanning microscopy}} {{in conjunction with a}} new microsphere-based protocol. In the Quantitative Microsphere Recruitment Assay (QMRA) introduced here, epidermal growth factor-coated 1 mm diameter microspheres were distributed over the surface of <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> culture cells expressing the receptor. High-resolution confocal microscopy of a fusion construct of the receptor and the green fluorescent protein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated that engulfment and internalization of the microspheres occurred rapidly within minutes, and in a receptor activation-dependent manner. In human epidermoid carcinoma A 431 cells, receptor activation and Shc translocation persisted over the 20 -minute time course of the experiments. However, at the subcellular level the positive correlation of receptor activation and Shc translocation observed at 5 - 8 minutes dissipated, indicating a time-dependent decoupling of thetwo events and variation in the kinetics of signal transduction for different subcellular locations...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of {{techniques such as}} microarrays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing is critically dependent on RNA quality. We have repeatedly observed extensive RNA degradation following trypsinization, a routine procedure used to dissociate <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> culture cells prior to RNA extraction. This study investigated {{the cause of this}} degradation and identifies an alternative procedure that enables extraction of intact high-quality RNA. Trypsinization and several alternative procedures were used to dissociate a range of different cell lines prior to RNA extraction. The contribution of exogenous ribonucleases or induction of endogenous ribonucleases by trypsin reagent proteases to RNA degradation was examined. Trypsinization resulted in a complete degradation of RNA regardless of cell line type, differentiation stage, or passage number. This occurred when intact RNA was incubated directly with trypsin and was not suppressed by inhibiting trypsin's protease activity. Prevention of degradation by sodium hypochlorite treatment of trypsin reagent identified the presence of ribonucleases in trypsin derived from animal pancreas. Consistent extraction of high-quality RNA requires the use of direct cell lysis with a phenol guanidine-based reagent or an animal origin-free protease-based dissociation agent if enzymatic detachment prior to RNA extraction cannot be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Parathyroid gland {{carcinoma}} is uncommon disease, accounting {{less than}} 1 % among {{the cases of}} primary hyperparathyroidism. There has been reported variations in prevalence between the nations, with higher occurence in Japan and Italy, according to their referral centers. Parathyroid cancer occurs mostly in patients above 30 years, but no sex differences have been noticed. Clinical signs correspond to symptoms of hypercalcaemia, which is usually severe, due to high production of parathyroid hormone in mostly functional tumors. Palpable mass in the neck and osteoporosis are present in about 50 % of the cases. We report a case of 24 -year old female victim of traffic accident, suffering severe traumatic injuries- intracerebral and brainstem bleeding and contusions, together with femoral fracture, in which intensive care management simptoms suspicious to parathyroid carcinoma have been observed. Further imaging, laboratory findings, and clinical signs confirmed diagnosis. Surgery, with „en bloc" excision of the node together with <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> has been performed. Definite histopathology finding approved parathyroid carcinoma. Clinical signs and laboratory findings normalized in the next period, and patient was discharged from our intensive care.

40|$|The {{production}} of cytokines by HIV-infected cells from <b>adherent</b> <b>tissues</b> {{as well as}} their effects on HIV replication in the same cells were investigated. CD 4 -transfected HeLa-T 4 - 6 c epithelial cells, CD 4 -positive normal lung fibroblasts and CD 4 -negative RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells were infected with HIV- 1. All cultures were permissive for virus replication, which was completed within 48 - 72 h by Hela-T 4 - 6 c and RD cells and 2 - 3 weeks in normal fibroblasts. During the course of HIV replication, a series of cytokines (particularly IL- 6 and TNF alpha) was produced and released in parallel to the peak of virus growth, in amounts varying with the cell system studied. Treatment of cultures with recombinant cytokines given at concentrations in the range of those induced by HIV- 1 indicated that IL- 6 and TNF alpha caused an increase of: i) CD 4 expression, ii) HIV absorption to uninfected cells, and iii) release of infectious virions by infected cells. The fact that HIV- 1 absorption and spread can be mediated by HIV-induced cytokines may be relevant in the pathogenesis of the in vivo disease, as it may constitute a possible self-enhancing model of HIV infection also in the solid tissues...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine whether}} Escherichia coli <b>adherent</b> to <b>tissue</b> cells gain advantages over nonadherent bacteria due to their proximity to the cells. We used tissue culture cells and isogenic derivatives of a proline auxotrophic strain of E. coli that were fimbriated (Fim+) or nonfimbriated (Fim-), and were heat-labile enterotoxin producing (Tox+) or toxin nonproducing (Tox-). We found that the Fim+ bacteria; which were capable of adhering to tissue culture cells, initiated growth much sooner than did nonadherent Fim- bacteria; the <b>adherent</b> bacteria used <b>tissue</b> cell-derived proline, which was available at high concentrations only in the zone of bacterial adherence. Likewise, cyclic AMP secreted by adherent (Fim+) bacteria was maintained at high concentration on the tissue cell surfaces. As few as 2 X 10 (5) adherent Fim+ Tox+ bacteria exert toxic activity upon Y 1 adrenal cells, whereas toxin secreted in the medium by 6 X 10 (6) Fim- Tox+ bacteria was undetectable. The {{results suggest that the}} growth advantage and enhanced toxicity of adherent E. coli is due to restricted diffusion of products secreted by the tissue culture and bacterial cells, respectively...|$|R

30|$|Immediately after extraction, {{the teeth}} were washed in running water, and all blood and <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> were removed. The teeth were then placed in {{distilled}} water and stored at 37 °C. The 90 teeth {{were divided into}} three groups of 30 specimens; the three groups represented three time points: T 1, T 2, and T 3. A standard reproducible flat surface was utilized on each tooth, where two brackets (precoated and conventionally bonded) were placed on each facial surface. The tooth surfaces were kept wet at all times. The enamel was cleaned with pumice. The enamel was etched with 35 % phosphoric acid gel (3  M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) for 20  s, rinsed under running water for 20  s, and then dried with oil- and moisture-free compressed air.

30|$|Various {{reports have}} {{described}} treatments for complications arising from mesh-induced injuries. About 82 % {{of patients with}} recurrences underwent a reoperation, {{according to the report}} by Stadlhuber et al. [1]. The most frequently performed surgical procedure was an esophagectomy, but other procedures included mesh removal by total gastrectomy, partial gastrectomy, or laparotomy. Non-operative procedures that were reported included endoscopic removal and stent placement. Our literature review showed that reoperation was necessary in 68 % of cases, and the mesh was removed endoscopically in 21 % of the cases. Stent placement and balloon dilation were performed in 2 of the 19 reported cases (10 %). Endoscopic balloon dilatation is not a radical treatment for esophageal stenosis caused by a mesh. Rather than endoscopic treatment, mesh excision should be performed to obtain a good outcome. In the present case, we attempted to remove the mesh during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy using balloon dilation. Our attempt failed, however, {{because of the presence of}} firmly <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> and fibrous tissue incorporation. Surgery should be considered when a cure cannot be achieved endoscopically. The methods used to treat complications, including surgery, should be decided in accordance with the disease condition, and reoperation has been undertaken in many cases; therefore, the selection of the mesh, including consideration of its material composition, at the time of the initial operation and the position and distance from the esophageal hiatus at which the mesh is fixed are of clinical importance.|$|E
40|$|The present article {{reports a}} fossilized {{pollination}} droplet at the micropylar orifice in a compressed seed Gopadisper-mum papillatus gen. et sp. nov. from the Middle Triassic beds of Nidpur, Madhya Pradesh, India. The shapeless droplet forming a convexity above the micropylar orifice {{is comprised of}} a resinous crystalline substance. Entrapped within the droplet are a few saccate pollen grains. The seeds are small, oblong to widely elliptical in shape, about 3 mm long and generally 2 mm broad. The micropylar end shows a short straight beak-like micropyle often extended beyond a persistently adhering wrinkled tissue lying outside the seed coat. The seed is composed of four membranes excluding the <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue.</b> They are the outer and inner cuticles of integument, the nucellar cuticle distally modified to form a dark collar-like pollen chamber and the innermost megaspore membrane. Cuticles of the tissue adhering to seed coat are different from seed coat cuticles. The pollen grains inside the pollen chamber are frequently clumped together forming a pollen mass. Individual pollen grains appear spheroidal to ellipsoidal in shape and are saccate. This is the first report of the preservation of a pollination droplet in a compressed seed specimen from the Nidpur Triassic beds. Preservation of the droplet {{can be attributed to}} its supposed resinous constitution and the entrapped organic contents (pollen grains).

30|$|There are two {{existing}} theories for {{the generation}} of the main forces measured in callus distraction: some authors suggest that bone segment transport forces cannot {{be attributed to the}} soft tissues, whereas others believe that the soft tissues play a decisive role in force generation. The present study indicates that soft tissues are of relevance in BST biomechanically. As this study was performed on human cadavers, no callus formation was possible, and therefore, no callus-related force was included in the measurements. In contrast to the studies mentioned above, frictional forces of the distraction system were measured prior to the experiment and were subtracted from the resulting data later in the experiment leaving the final force data representing that solely generated by all adherent structures of the bone segment and by the tissues blocking the bone gap. The three-part curve progression shown in the results is interpreted as follows: the initial increase in force can be related to soft-tissue tension from implantation of the CDS (0 – 10  mm); the subsequent almost linear increase with distance represents the distraction force generated by the soft tissues (10 – 50  mm); and the rapid increase in force {{at the end of the}} transport distance can be related to the soft tissues blocking the bone gap and the impact of the bone segment at the docking site. Forces for 60 -mm bone segments were higher throughout the whole period of BST, indicating that a higher amount of <b>adherent</b> <b>tissues</b> had been involved in the transport process (Fig.  6).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: Chronically {{implanted}} catheters {{often become}} {{covered with a}} thin, white adherent covering of tissue that {{has been referred to}} as a fibrin sheath. This tissue often in-terferes with catheter function. Methods: To chronicle the devel-opment of this sheath, rats were implanted with silicone rubber central venous catheters. Five rats were euthanized at 3, 7, and 60 days postimplantation so that gross necropsy and histology could be performed on the catheterized vessels. Results: The coat-ing that developed around the external portion of the catheter started as a dark red thrombus containing fibrin and progressed into vascularized, fibrous connective tissue. Conclusions: The translucent to white sheath that forms around chronically im-planted catheters is not composed of fibrin and is therefore not likely to be dissolved by fibrinolytic agents such as urokinase, streptokinase, or tissue plasminogen activator. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 20 : 156 - 158, 1996) Chronically implanted central venous catheters (CVCs) often develop a layer of thin, <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue.</b> When it cov-ers the tip, this material can cause withdrawal occlusion and sometimes interferes with infusion through the cath-eter. This covering has been widely referred to as a fibrin sheath. 1 - 7 However, during histologic examination of veins from rats with occluded CVCs, we noted that this cover-ing was not composed of fibrin. The present study was undertaken to investigate and describe the development of this tissue covering during the course of 8 weeks in rats with CVCs inserted through the right external jugular vein...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Secondary {{postpartum}} haemorrhage [PPH] or puerperal haemorrhage, though rare {{can sometimes}} cause severe morbidity needing prolonged hospitalisation. Majority {{of the cases}} can be managed medically, {{a few of them}} requiring surgical interventions. With retained placental tissue being a common cause, emptying the uterus in the puerperium can be difficult and dangerous too as the wall is soft and perforation chances are high. Hysteroscopic evaluation of the puerperal uterus gives us a better picture of the retained bits of placental tissue, and helps in complete evacuation of the tissue without causing much trauma to the fragile uterine wall. It is also more specific than ultrasonogram [USG] to rule out the presence of retained tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS 17 patients who had secondary PPH and did not respond to the initial medical management were included in the study. Hysteroscopy was done in these cases. Definitive pathology was found in 12 cases; 7 cases had polypoidal tissue [retained bits of placenta], 3 cases had placental tissue adherent to the caesarean scar [placenta accreta] and 2 cases had submucous fibroids. RESULTS In cases which had retained placental bits, the tissue could be visualised, its exact location noted and the entire tissue could be removed without inciting much trauma to the uterine wall. In cases with placenta accreta, gentle extraction of the <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> could be done without traumatising the scar. In one case which had multiple fibroids with irregular uterine cavity, hysteroscopy helped in localising the retained tissue. CONCLUSION Hysteroscopy is a useful modality in managing cases of secondary PPH, who have persistent bleeding in the postpartum period...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{umbilical}} cord-derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (hUC-MSCs) {{are in the}} foreground as a preferable application for treating diseases. However, the safety of hUC-MSCs after long-term culturing in vitro in serum-free medium remains unclear. METHODS: hUC-MSCs were separated by <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> culture. hUC-MSCs were cultured in serum-free MesenCult-XF medium and FBS-bases DMEM complete medium. At the 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th, 8 th, 10 th, and 15 th passage, the differentiation of MSCs into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic cells was detected, and MTT, surface antigens were measured. Tumorigenicity was analyzed at the 15 th passage. Conventional karyotyping was performed at passage 0, 8, and 15. The telomerase activity of hUC-MSCs at passage 1 - 15 was analyzed. RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis showed that very high expression was detected for CD 105, CD 73, and CD 90 and very low expression for CD 45, CD 34, CD 14, CD 79 a, and HLA-DR. MSCs could differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes in vitro. There was no obvious chromosome elimination, displacement, or chromosomal imbalance as determined from the guidelines of the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature. Telomerase activity was down-regulated significantly when the culture time was prolonged. Further, no tumors formed in rats injected with hUC-MSCs (P 15) cultured in serum-free and in serum-containing conditions. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that hUC-MSCs met the International Society for Cellular Therapy standards for conditions of long-term in vitro culturing at P 15. Since hUC-MSCs can be safely expanded in vitro and are not susceptible to malignant transformation in serum-free medium, these cells are suitable for cell therapy...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} whether decreasing the phospholipidic fraction in lipid-protein-sugar particles (LPSPs), designed to achieve prolonged duration local anesthesia, can reduce tissue reaction without compromising {{the duration of}} nerve block. Methods. Bupivacaine-loaded LPSPs were prepared by spray drying an ethanol:water mixture containing albumin, α-lactose, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC, 3 % or 60 % w/w) and bupivacaine. Drug loading was assessed. Duration of block was measured in rats following sciatic nerve injection. One, 4 and 14 days after the injection, nerves were harvested for histology, together with <b>adherent</b> <b>tissues.</b> Results. 60 % and 3 % DPPC particles had 7. 18 ± 0. 47 % and 7. 21 ± 0. 94 % bupivacaine loading, respectively. Sensory and motor block from 3 % DPPC lasted 301 ± 56 minutes and 412 ± 173 minutes. Corresponding data for 60 % DPPC particles were 321 ± 127 and 513 ± 216 minutes with {{no statistically significant difference}} between formulations. On gross dissection, pockets of particles were not detectable in any animal receiving 3 % DPPC particles. However, they were detected in all animals receiving 60 % DPPC particles 1 day after injection, 2 of 4 rats at 4 days, none at 14 days. All animals showed an acute inflammatory response with neutrophils at 1 day after injection; at 4 days, the rats receiving the 60 % DPPC particles still showed acute inflammation, while 3 % DPPC particles led to a milder tissue reaction with more mononuclear cells. At 14 days, both groups showed a mild mononuclear reaction. Conclusion. The two formulations containing the same loading of bupivacaine but different amounts of DPPC demonstrated equivalent durations of block.

40|$|Leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) {{stimulation}} of guinea-pig peritoneal eosinophils, induced a biphasic {{activation of the}} NADPH oxidase composed of a rapid (< 3 [*]min) phase mediated by non-adherent cells and a sustained (3 [*]–[*] 120 [*]min) phase mediated by CD 11 b/CD 18 adherent eosinophils. Studies were undertaken to compare the intracellular mechanism that mediate these responses. SB 203580 and PP 1, inhibitors of p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the src-family protein tyrosine kinases, respectively caused concentration-dependent attenuation of both the rapid (SB 203580 : pD 2 =− 6. 31; PP 1 : pD 2 =− 5. 50) and sustained (SB 203580 : pD 2 =− 6. 50; PP 1 : pD 2 =− 5. 73) phases. Similarly, the MAP kinase kinase- 1 inhibitor, PD 098059 produced partial inhibition of the both phases of superoxide generation. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors Ro- 31 8220, GF 109203 X and Gö 6976 attenuated the rapid NADPH oxidase response (pD 2 s=− 6. 10, − 6. 72, − 6. 15 respectively) and, to a lesser extent, (pD 2 s=− 5. 54, − 6. 02, − 6. 51 respectively) the sustained phase. An inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PtdIns 3 -kinase), wortmannin caused concentration dependent attenuation of the sustained (pD 2 =− 8. 68) but not rapid phase of superoxide generation. In contrast, the syk kinase inhibitor, piceatannol abolished the rapid (pD 2 =− 6. 43) but not sustained respiratory responses. This study demonstrates that LTB 4 -induced superoxide generation from adherent and non-adherent eosinophils is mediated via both common (p 38 MAP kinase, MEK- 1, PKC and the src kinases) and divergent intracellular pathways (syk kinases and PtdIns 3 -kinase).

40|$|Since {{the first}} reports of {{induction}} of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) into neuronal and glial cell phenotypes, expectations have increased regarding {{their use in}} tissue engineering applications for nerve repair. Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) is a basic feature of survival, differentiation, and migration of Schwann cells (SC) during nerve regeneration, and fibronectin and laminin are two key molecules of this process. Interaction between ECM and SC-like differentiated ASC (dASC) could potentially improve the neurotrophic potential of the stem cells. We have investigated the effect of ECM molecules on SC-like dASC in terms of proliferation, adhesion, and cell viability. Fibronectin and laminin {{did not affect the}} proliferation of dASC when compared with cell <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> culture plastic, but significantly improved viability and cell attachment when dASC were exposed to apoptotic conditions. To assess the influence of the ECM molecules on dASC neurotrophic activity, dASC were seeded onto ECM-coated culture inserts suspended above dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons was enhanced when dASC were seeded on fibronectin and laminin when compared with controls. When DRG neurons and dASC were in direct contact on the various surfaces there was significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth and coculture with laminin-conditioned dASC produced the longest neurites. Compared with primary SCs, dASC grown on laminin produced similar levels of neurite outgrowth in the culture insert experiments but neurite length was shorter in the direct contact groups. Anti β 1 integrin blocking antibody could inhibit baseline and dASC evoked neurite elongation but had no effect on outgrowth mediated by laminin-conditioned dASC. ECM molecules had no effect on the levels of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion from dASC. The results of the study suggest that ECM molecules can significantly improve the potential of dASC for nerve regeneration...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Established {{techniques}} for culturing primary human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have facilitated the laboratory investigation of this multipurpose retinal cell layer. However, most culture methods involve {{the use of}} animal serum {{to establish and maintain}} RPE monolayers, which can complicate efforts to define and study factors involved in the maturation and function of these cells. Therefore, this study was conducted to develop a simple, serum-free system to propagate and sustain human RPE in vitro. METHODS: RPE was dissected from human prenatal donor eyes and cultured in serum-free defined medium containing the commercially formulated supplement B 27 or N 2. Cultures were grown initially as <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> sections or suspended spherical aggregates and later expanded and maintained as monolayers. PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry were used to monitor gene and protein expression in established cultures, followed by examination of secretory products in RPE conditioned medium by ELISA and mass spectrometric analysis. RESULTS: In medium supplemented with B 27, but not N 2, RPE could be expanded up to 40, 000 -fold over six passages and maintained in culture for more than 1 year. In long-term cultures, typical cellular morphology and pigmentation were observed, along with expression of characteristic RPE markers. RPE monolayers also retained proper apical-basal orientation and secreted multiple factors implicated in the maintenance of photoreceptor health and the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Monolayer cultures of human prenatal RPE can be grown and maintained long term in the total absence of serum and still retain the phenotype, gene and protein expression profile, and secretory capacity exhibited by mature RPE cells.

40|$|Stem cell {{transplantation}} after myocardial infarction has been claimed to restore cardiac function, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. A minority of transplanted cells become <b>adherent</b> in heart <b>tissue</b> {{and contribute to}} neovascularization, whereas many donor cells die from apoptosis. We propose that apoptosis of transplanted cells modulates local tissue reactions. Apoptotic cells impact on immune reactivity by down-regulating innate and adaptive immunity, deactivating macrophages and dendritic cells, and stimulating regulatory T cells. This leads to reduced scar formation, repressed myocardial apoptosis, and improved cardiac outcome...|$|R
30|$|The {{main goal}} of surgery for {{patients}} with foot deformities from polio {{is to improve the}} function [16, 17] and not cosmesis. This must be made clear to the patient as some have unrealistically high expectations of what surgery can achieve. There are many options of treatment for foot deformities from poliomyelitis. Traditionally, management of neurological foot deformities required a combination of soft tissue and bony procedures for the correction of the many components of the deformity [4]. Multiplanar foot deformities in neurological disorders that are associated with severe joint stiffness and soft tissue contractures pose a significant challenge to the use of conventional corrective methods, such as osteotomies, triple arthrodesis or talectomy. Acute corrections from large wedge resections of bone lead to a greater risk of damaging the neurovascular bundle, which is usually surrounded by <b>adherent</b> scar <b>tissue.</b> Additionally, these closing wedge corrections and conventional arthrodeses produce additional shortening of the foot and lead to needing shoes of different sizes [9, 18].|$|R
40|$|We have {{produced}} images of whole wet tissue culture cells with the Stony Brook/BNL scanning transmission x-ray microscope (STXM). For fixed cells {{we have taken}} images at theoretical resolutions of 50 - 75 nm, and in practice have measured FWHM of features down to near lOOnm, without any exotic processing. For un-fixed (i. e., initially live) cells we have imaged with 100 nm pixels and measured features down to 250 nm. We have developed, tested and used a wet cell for maintaining fixed or live cells on the STXM stage during imaging. Our design of the wet cell and the culture substrates that go with it make the STXM compatible with almost all standard systems for surface <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> culture. We have made measurements of radiation damage to STXM images due {{to the process of}} imaging. The damage we see in the STXM is mass loss from the sample. Our measurements give two principal results. One, the damage caused by absorption of radiation in fixed cells is a linear loss of x-ray absorbing mass with cumulative energy absorbed. Two, the measured value for the slope of that linear relationship is found to be α =- 0. 78 ± 0. 35 in units of [C atom equivalent absorption] per [eV absorbed]. These observations allow us to model several different aspects of the imaging of fixed tissue. We have also produced a pair of carbon and oxygen mass distribution maps of a fixed chick fibroblast that shows some differences in composition among sub-micron features. This pair of maps is the result of taking x-ray transmission images at two different wavelengths, and decomposing that data into carbon and oxygen mass maps. Our results on radiation damage suggest that the STXM {{may not be able to}} do much better than 50 nm resolution on unprotected tissue culture cells. Both the ability of the STXM to measure the radiation hardness α and its ability to produce elemental decompositions suggest that the best feature of the STXM may be its ability to provide novel types of quantitative analysis of whole wet samples at high resolution. ...|$|E
40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} {{has become}} a promising treatment for type I diabetes mellitus due to recent success since {{the development of the}} Edmonton Protocol. Islet culture prior to transplantation is standard practice in most clinical islet programs. Conventional culture conducted on polystyrene vessels can impose oxygen limitations even at relatively low tissue surface densities. High density islet culture is desirable because it reduces space and handling requirements during culture, but it exacerbates oxygen (02) limitations, causing a reduction in islet viability. The overall objective of this thesis was to maintain islet quality during static culture. As a chemical engineer, I focused on addressing transport limitations present in conventional culture techniques. After demonstrating culture in the absence of 02 transport limitations resulted in nearly 100 % recovery of the original viable tissue placed into culture when the combined non-adherent and <b>adherent</b> <b>tissue</b> were considered, I examined the effect of tissue surface density on the recovery of islet tissue, its viability, and its purity for conventional normoxic culture on a polystyrene dish. With conventional culture, the fractional recovery of viable tissue decreased sharply as viable tissue density increased. (cont.) To improve islet quality in high density culture, I investigated use of elevated ambient 02, reduced culture temperature, and culture on an oxygen-permeable silicone rubber membrane. By applying a theoretical 02 transport model, I investigated how 02 transport changes for each culture condition and compared predictions to the experimental data to determine whether 02 is limiting during high density culture using these new techniques. At high tissue surface densities, the fractional recovery of viable tissue was higher with culture on polystyrene in elevated (56 %) 02 or culture at reduced temperature (24 'C), and even higher with normoxic culture on a silicone rubber membrane. Theoretical predictions based on 02 transport were qualitatively similar to experimental results but in general overpredicted the amount of viable tissue recovered. Additional theoretical calculations indicated simplifications made when modeling oxygen along with glucose and pH changes during culture could account for the slight overprediction. In conclusion, in high density culture, recovery of viable tissue (1) decreases as culture density increases on a polystyrene surface; (2) increases with increasing external 02; and (3) increases substantially with culture on silicone rubber by removing 02 limitations. (cont.) The techniques examined significantly improve tissue oxygenation compared to conventional culture, and allow tissue to be cultured at higher densities without a reduction in viability. These methods can be easily implemented, which would enable clinical centers to reduce space and handling requirements during culture prior to transplantation without the reduction in islet viability that can occur with conventional methods, and thereby maximize the use of limited islet resources. by Michael James Rappel.

40|$|Abstract Background Complete tumor {{removal and}} {{preservation}} {{of the facial nerve}} are essential in parotid gland surgery. A technical adjunct that potentially enhances the contrast between the facial nerve and the <b>adherent</b> tumor <b>tissue</b> and allows to identify residual tumor tissue could be Fluorescein Sodium. Methods Retrospective chart analysis on 7 patients with benign parotid gland lesions that were operated using Fluorescein Sodium intravenously and the application of the YELLOW 560  nm filter of the operating microscope. Safety and feasibility were evaluated. Results All tumors showed fluorescence and the rating ´contrast-enhancing´ was assigned in all cases. In 2 patients, satellite nodules were identified and resected meaning that the fluorescence staining of the tumor margins was significantly better than under white light. Conclusion The use of Fluorescein Sodium in parotidectomy is promising. In two cases residual tumor was detected that would have been left behind under white light. Further research in parotid gland surgery and other head and neck tumor procedures is warranted...|$|R

False aneurysm is discontinuity in the vascular wall {{leading to}} an extravascular hematoma that freely communicates with the intravascular space producing pulsatile hematoma. In false aneurysm wall is ruptured and there is collection of blood(hematoma) that is bounded externally by <b>adherent</b> extravascular <b>tissue.</b> However any vessel may be affected by {{a wide variety of}} disorders that weaken the wall, including trauma (traumatic aneurysm), infection,congenital defects such as potentiating berry aneurysm. Sporadic cases of false aneurysm following fractures of the facial bone have been reported but are few. aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm are complication of maxillo-facial trauma but sometimes occurs a result of isolated mandibular condylar fracture.

40|$|Abstract. To {{protect the}} body {{efficiently}} from infectious organisms, leukocytes circulate as nonadherent {{cells in the}} blood and lymph, and migrate as <b>adherent</b> cells into <b>tissues.</b> Circulating leukocytes in the blood have first to adhere to and then to cross the endothelial lining. CD 31 /PECAM- 1 is an adhesion molecule expressed by vascular endothelial cells, platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, and naive T lymphocytes. It is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily (IgSF), with six Ig-like homology units mediating leukocyte-endothelial interactions. The adhesive interactions mediated by CD 31 are complex and include homophilic (CD 31 -CD 31) or heterophilic (CD 31 -X) contacts. Soluble, recombinant forms of CD 31 allowed us to study the heterophilic interaction...|$|R
