Empirical observations of societal behavior patterns lead to a relationship for the quantitative value of societal risk impact which is consistent with general societal risk acceptance, is not inconsistent with ``de facto`` risk regulation, and is suitable and appropriate as a specification or guide for risk management and risk regulation. This societal risk impact expression is: Impact ($/year) = (8 {times} 10 {sup 7 }) NR{sub i}{sup 4 / 3 } where Ri = individual annual mortality risk; N = number of persons in the population sharing the risk and benefits.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to minimise capital costs and energy usage in a district heating network is presented. The method comprises a two-stage programming model, which synthesises design and the optimal operation of a district heating network. Two different optimisation approaches—(a) minimising the annual total energy usage, and (b) minimising the <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> of the heat network installation and operation—were examined and high and low temperatures district heating were investigated. For each optimisation approach, the minimum optimal annual total energy usage and minimum optimal <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> were calculated and suitable pipe and pump sizes, taking into account different supply and return temperature regimes, target pressure losses and operating strategies within a district heating network were found. Design cases with minimum annual total energy usage and minimum <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. This in turn reduced the annual total energy usage and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> and the suitable pipe and pump sizes were selected. In addition, {{it was observed that}} by reducing the water temperature, the annual total energy usage and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> could be reduced further. However, the obtained design cases based on a low temperature had relatively larger pipe sizes and smaller pressure drops compared with design cases obtained for the high temperature district heating...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIncreasing water {{scarcity}} challenges conventional approaches to managing water resources. More holistic tools and methods {{are required to}} support the integrated planning and management of fresh water resources at the river basin level. This paper compares an index-based cost-effectiveness analysis (IBCEA) with a least-cost river basin optimization model (LCRBOM). Both methods are applied to a real case study to design a cost-effective portfolio of water demand and supply management measures that ensures compliance with water supply and environmental targets. The IBCEA is a common approach to select programmes of measures {{in the implementation of}} the EU Water Framework Directive. We describe its limitations in finding a least-cost solution at the river basin level and highlight the benefits from implementing a LCRBOM. Both methods are compared in a real case study, the Orb river basin, in the south of France. The performances of the programmes of measures selected by the two methods are compared for the same <b>annual</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>cost.</b> By ignoring the spatial and temporal variability of water availability and water demands in the river basin and the interconnection among its elements, the aggregated approach used in the standard IBCEA can miss more cost-effective solutions at the river basin scale...|$|E

Thus the aim of this work was to evaluate economically the activities of felling and timber extraction held by skidders harvester and forwarder up to approximately 30, 000 hours of work. Seventeen forest machines were used: 5 harvesters John Deere model 1270 D, and 5 harvesters John Deere model 1470 D, with power of 215 hp (160 kW) and 241 hp (180 kW), respectively, and 7 forwarders John Deere model 1710 D, with power of 215 hp (160 kW).

40|$|Abstract Background Targeted outreach, counselling, and {{treatment}} of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{are among the most}} cost-effective interventions aimed at ameliorating the burden of HIV/STIs. Since many new HIV infections occur in people under the age of 25, youth, and especially most at risk adolescents (MARA), {{need to be able to}} access HIV/STI services. Starting in 2006, a programme targeting MARA including outreach, confidential and voluntary counselling and testing, and STI diagnosis {{and treatment}} was piloted in three cities in Tajikistan. This study uses data from these pilot sites to estimate the costs of a national programme. Methods Cost data were collected from the three pilot sites. Then, the target population and the number of patients receiving specific types of services are calculated for other areas. The unit costs from the pilot sites are multiplied by usage rates to determine the total costs of a national programme. Scenarios were developed to reflect data uncertainty. The government's ability to finance the programme was estimated using Ministry of Health budget data. Further analyses were done for one of the pilot cities where more detailed data were available. Results In total, costs were projected for eight programme sites, covering an estimated 8, 020 MARA. Operational and variable cost for the programme are projected to be US$ 119, 159 (range US$ 104, 953 to 151, 524) per year. Including <b>annual</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>cost</b> for capital and start-up items raises this to US$ 137, 082 (range: US$ 123, 022 to 169, 597) per year. The analyses of potential sources of financing for the programme remain inconclusive, but it may take multiple sources of financing to fund the programme. Conclusion While the cost-effectiveness of similar programmes have been previously assessed using modelled data, more work needs to be done to assess the costs of new programmes in relation to financial resources available. Full costing should consider cost-savings as well as expenditures. If feasible, the impact of the programme should be monitored over time. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ageing of {{components}} {{is a major}} threat to asset integrity in offshore process facilities. A robust maintenance strategy mitigates the effects of age-based structural degradations and reduces the threat of failure. Failure caused by structural degradations is a stochastic process. For maintenance strategies to be effective, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. Risk based integrity modeling (RBIM) is a newly-developed approach that aims at the protection of human life, financial investment, and the environment against the consequences of failure. RBIM quantifies the risk to which individual components are subjected and uses this as a basis for the design of a maintenance strategy. Risk is a combination of the probability and the consequence of failure. The major age-based structural degradations to be addressed include corrosion; such as uniform, pitting and erosion mechanisms; and cracking; such as stress corrosion, corrosion fatigue, and hydrogen induced cracking. In this study, component degradation processes are modeled stochastically to estimate the probability of failure using Bayesian analysis methods. Bayesian analysis improves the fidelity on the likelihood of future events by relating with the prior and posterior probabilities. Prior modeling is performed using judgmental studies and analyzing historic databases from similar installations. For the assessment of ageing assets and degradation mechanisms, field non-destructive test (NDT) data is used to establish the likelihood function. The posterior modeling is performed using a simulation-based Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Laplace approximation since the prior-likelihood combinations are non-conjugate pairs. In this study, the consequences of failure are modeled using economic analysis to estimate the costs of failure, inspection and maintenance. The cost of failure includes lost production, loss of shutdown, cost of spill cleanup, loss caused by environmental damage and liability. The inspection and maintenance costs are estimated using the inspection and maintenance tasks, access, surface preparation, gauging defects, coating and restoration costs. Maintenance may be either minimal repair or replacement {{of components}}. The <b>annual</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>cost</b> (AEC) of operation and maintaining a facility is the summation of the annual equivalent costs of failure, inspection, and maintenance. The cumulative posterior failure probability is combined with AEC to produce the operational life risk curve for a component. Since the risk curve is a convex function of the maintenance interval, then the optimum interval is the global minimum point. The operational risk is thus reduced to as low as reasonably practicable level by optimal maintenance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the problem}} of replacement by investigating the optimal moment of investment replacement in a given tax environment with a given depreciation policy. An operation and maintenance cost minimization model, based on the definition of <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost,</b> is applied to a real options paradigm. The developed methodology allows for an innovative evaluation of the flexibility of replacement process analysis. A new two-factor evaluation function is introduced to quantify decisions on asset replacement under a unique cycle environment. This study improves upon previous findings in the literature as it accounts for autonomous salvage value processes. Based on partial differential equations, this model achieves a general analytical solution and particular numerical solution. The results differ significantly from those observed in one-factor models by showing evidence of over-evaluation in optimal levels of replacement, and by confirming suspicions that different types of uncertainties produce non-monotonous effects on the optimal replacement level. The scientific contribution of this study lies in new and stronger approaches to <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> literature, supplying an algorithm for operation and maintenance cost minimization that is conditioned by autonomous salvage value.

This has, among others, resulted in the reclamation of swamps, flood plains, tidal areas and even lakes by impoldering.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rainfall in the Netherlands has {{moderate}} intensities {{and is more}} or less {{evenly distributed}} over the year while in Thailand rainfall occurs at high intensities and predominantly in the rainy season. The aim of the water management system in an urban area in a polder is to provide good drainage and discharge out of the polder. This paper presents a mathematical model for the optimisation of the main components of the water management system in urban areas in polders in the Netherlands and in Thailand. The main components of the water management system in an urban area in a polder are cross-sections of the sewers, distances between the canals, percentages of open water, canal water levels below the surface and discharge capacity of the outfall structures or the pumping stations. In order to find optional values for these main components the software package OPOL has been further developed. This package takes into account the relevant hydrological processes, construction and operation and maintenance costs for the water management system and damages due to high groundwater tables, water on the street, or even inundation under influence of rainfall and water level fluctuations in the urban canals. Optimising such a system aims at determining the main components {{in such a way that}} the <b>annual</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>costs</b> will be minimal.

A number of different design cases were simulated using the PSS SINCAL, taking into account different supply and return temperatures and target pressure losses.

Optimisation was conducted to obtain the optimal flow rate and supply temperature for the variable flow and variable supply temperature operating strategy. The optimisation model was formulated using the FICO™ Xpress optimisation suite. The objective of optimisation was to minimise the annual total energy consumption and costs.

40|$|The Hollandsche IJssel is a river between Rotterdam and Gouda and is {{protected}} from the main river system in the Netherlands by a storm surge barrier. The Hollandsche IJssel experiences several problems: the storm surge barrier dates from 1958 and has a relatively low closure reliability; {{three quarters of the}} dikes have been rejected according to the safety standards due to macrostabilty; subsidence of the dikes is approximately 90 cm per century; there is limited space available to reinforce the dikes because of the dense housing next to the dikes. To determine the current flood probability and risk, the use of fragility curves is applied. They represent the state of the dikes and can be combined with a probability density function of water levels, which represents the state of the storm surge barrier. This will return the flood probability. By combining them with damage curves, the flood risk can be assessed. To determine cost-optimal flood risk reduction strategies, the use of <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> is applied. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> is defined as the net present value of a project devided by the present value of annuity. It can be seen as an interest weighted average annual cash flow. By keeping the <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost</b> as continuously as low as possible, flood risk reduction strategies can be determined which after manual post-processing proved to be cost-optimal. This proved to result in three strategies for the Hollandsche IJssel: the dike reinforcement strategy, the double barrier strategy and the canalization strategy. The dike reinforcement strategy gradually reinforces the dikes and keeps the current storm surge barrier until no longer possible after which it is replaced by a similar one (likely around 2060). The double barrier strategy suggests the construction of a second storm surge barrier to increase closure reliability. This leads to a postponement of dike reinforcements, which are still required due to subsidence. Eventually, because of the limited amount of space that is available due to the dense housing: both lead to inevitability of canalization somewhere after 2100 (with the used schematization around 2120). Because of this inevitability, the recommended strategy is the third strategy: implement canalization immediately.

Minimization of costs and maximization of profit are {{the most frequently used}} economic criteria in technical papers.

This paper describes the characteristics ofthe optimal solutions obtained with various optimization criteria like the total annual cost, the profit, the payback time, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cost,</b> the net present worth, and the internal rate of return.
