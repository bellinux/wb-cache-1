Relation {{reversals}} in ontological systems {{refer to}} such patterns as a path from concept <b>A</b> to concept <b>B</b> in one version becoming {{a path with}} the position of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> <b>switched</b> in another version. We present a scalable approach, using cloud computing, to systematically extract all hierarchical relation reversals among 8 SNOMED CT versions from 2009 to 2014. Taking advantage of our MapReduce algorithms for computing transitive closure and large-scale set operations, 48 reversals were found through 28 pairwise comparison of the 8 versions in 18 minutes using a 30 -node local cloud, to completely cover all possible scenarios. Except for one, all such reversals occurred in three sub-hierarchies: Body Structure, Clinical Finding, and Procedure. Two (2) reversal pairs involved an uncoupling of the pair before the is-a coupling is reversed. Twelve (12) reversal pairs involved paths of length-two, and none (0) involved paths beyond length-two. Such reversals not only represent areas of potential need for additional modeling work, but also are important for identifying and handling cycles for comparative visualization of ontological evolution...|$|R

40|$|Self-assembly of b -sheet domains {{resulting}} {{in the formation of}} pathogenic, fibrillar protein aggregates (amyloids) is a characteristic feature of various medical disorders, including Alzheimer`s disease and prion-related diseases. The first part of the present work describes the association behaviour of b -sheet peptides. The water-soluble de novo peptides are composed of <b>a</b> central <b>b</b> -sheet-forming domain (valine-threonine-sequence), and N- and C-terminal non-structured octapeptide sequences which promote water solubility. It was shown, that the stability of the intermolecular b -sheet structures was influenced by variation of peptide length and D-amino acid substitutions. The association behaviour was found to correlate strongly with the stability of <b>a</b> <b>b</b> -sheet conformation. Model peptides with a (valine-threonine) n -domain, n ? 6 form stable, water-soluble b -sheet complexes with molecular masses of more than 2000 kDa, which are organized in fibrillar structures. The fibrils show similarities with naturally occurring amyloid fibrils. The second part of the work occupies with the conformation and association of the Alzheimer?s disease peptide <b>A</b> <b>b</b> (1 - 42). A critical event in Alzheimer?s disease is the transition of <b>A</b> <b>b</b> peptides from their soluble, monomeric forms into disease-associated b -sheet-rich conformers. In order {{to assess the impact of}} conformational alterations on the initiation of amyloid formation the influence of position-specific D-amino acid substitutions on the secondary structure and association behaviour of <b>A</b> <b>b</b> (1 - 42) was studied. Therefore a complete D-amino acid replacement set of <b>A</b> <b>b</b> (1 - 42) was synthesized. It was shown that the conformational <b>switch</b> of monomeric <b>A</b> <b>b</b> (1 - 42) into <b>a</b> <b>b</b> -structure is initiated by destabilization of the central a -helical domain comprising residues 11 to 24. This conformational <b>a</b> -to- <b>b</b> <b>switch</b> was directly accompanied by an aggregation process leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils. The present results have demonstrated for the first time, using the full-length 42 -mer Alzheimer-peptide, that the conformational stability of the central region (residues 11 - 24) directly controls the molecular switch of the peptide into <b>an</b> associating <b>b</b> -sheet structure. </P...|$|R

However serological analysis of IgG(1), IgG(2 <b>a),</b> and IgG(2 <b>b)</b> <b>switch</b> variants of murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3 E 5 IgG(3) with identical V domains revealed apparent specificity differences for Cryptococcus neoformans glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). Kinetic and thermodynamic binding properties of mAbs 3 E 5 to a 12 -mer peptide mimetic of GXM revealed differences in the affinity of these mAbs for a monovalent ligand, a result that implied that the constant (C) region affects the secondary structure of the antigen binding site, thus accounting for variations in specificity. Structural models of mAbs 3 E 5 suggested that isotype-related differences in binding resulted from amino acid sequence polymorphisms in the C region. This study implies that isotype switching is another mechanism for generating diversity in antigen binding and that isotype restriction of certain antibody responses may reflect structural constraints imposed by C region on V region binding. Furthermore, isotype affected the polyreactivity of V region identical antibodies, implying a role for C region in determining self-reactivity. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Immunoglobulin E (IgE) {{reactivity}} to self antigens is {{well established}} in vitro by ELISA, inhibition ELISA, Western blot analyses and T cell proliferation experiments. In vivo, IgE-binding self antigens are able to elicit strong type I reactions in sensitized individuals and, {{in the case of}} human manganese superoxide dismutase, to elicit eczematous reactions on healthy skin areas of patients suffering from atopic eczema. The reactions against self antigens sharing structural homology with environmental allergens can be plausibly explained by molecular mimicry between common B cell epitopes. For the second class of IgE-binding self antigens without sequence homology to known allergens, it is still unclear if the structures are able to induce <b>a</b> <b>B</b> cell <b>switch</b> to IgE production, or if the reactivity is due to sequence similarity shared with not yet detected environmental allergens. However, in all cases, cross-reactivity is never complete, indicating either a lower affinity of IgE antibodies to self allergens than to the homologous environmental allergens or the presence of additional B cell epitopes {{on the surface of the}} environmental allergens, or both. Increasing evidence shows that self allergens could play a decisive role in the exacerbation of long-lasting atopic diseases. However, the only observation supporting a clinical role of IgE-mediated autoreactivity is confined to the fact that IgE levels against self antigens correlate with disease severity. 2007 S.

The cross-section survey was conducted among patients attending the FIOCRUZ in Rio de Janeiro. In order to discriminate the genetic assemblages/sub-assemblages, G. lamblia isolates were characterized by PCR-RFLP and qPCR using four loci genes (bg, gdh, tpi and orfC 4). Of the 65 positive samples, 41 (63. 1 %) were successfully amplified by nested-PCR of bg and gdh genes. Among them, 16 were typed as sub-assemblage AII, 7 as BIII, 4 as BIV and 8 as a mixture of BIII and BIV. After the analysis by qPCR assay, a total of 55 (84. 6 %) samples were amplified using at least one locus: bg gene was amplified in 38 (58. 5 %) samples, gdh in 41 (63. 1 %), tpi in 39 (60 %), and orfC 4 in 39 (60 %).
