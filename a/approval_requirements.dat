5|$|Main Roads' 2006 {{plan for}} {{environmental}} {{management of the}} project included numerous aspects, described as best management practices, which for the northern segment of the project were beyond the environmental <b>approval</b> <b>requirements.</b> Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, vegetation, dieback and weeds, and revegetation and rehabilitation. Other areas with specific plans included topsoil management, drainage, construction (covering dust, noise, and vibrations), foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental <b>approval</b> <b>requirements.</b> Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} the second principle set out above, was {{the enactment of the}} Administrative Permission Law of the PRC (APL) on 27 August 2003, effective from July 2004.

25|$|In 1996, red tape, {{bureaucracy}} and the Licence Raj were suggested {{as a cause}} for the institutionalised corruption and inefficiency.

25|$|The APL also {{provides}} that only those laws {{adopted by the}} National People’s Congress or its Standing Committee, administrative regulations promulgated by the State Council, and local regulations adopted by the local people’s congresses may impose administrative <b>approval</b> <b>requirements.</b> Individual ministries or agencies (central or local) do not have such powers except in specified circumstances.

2500|$|The California Cannabis Coalition {{decision}} has raised issues concerning whether the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for local tax increases under Proposition 218 {{also apply to}} local tax initiatives placed on the ballot by the electorate exercising the local initiative power. [...] However, the California Cannabis Coalition case did not involve the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> under Proposition 218, but rather involved a narrow election timing issue (the election consolidation requirement) applicable only to general taxes which under Proposition 218 may only be levied by cities or counties in California.|$|E

2500|$|Proposition 218 {{expressly}} {{applies to}} regional governments in California under its broad “local government” constitutional definition.

2500|$|The {{practical}} {{effect of}} the federal law invalidity provision {{is that if the}} assessment ballot process were invalidated under federal law, the <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for assessments under Proposition 218 would become even more restrictive than if either no legal challenge under federal law had occurred or if any such legal challenge were unsuccessful. [...] This provides a strong disincentive to legally challenge the assessment ballot process under Proposition 218.|$|E
2500|$|Proposition 218 {{amended the}} California Constitution by adding Article XIII C and Article XIII D. [...] Article XIII C relates to voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for local {{government}} taxes.

[...] Article XIII D relates to assessment and property-related fee reforms applicable to local governments. [...] This includes numerous requirements for special assessments on real property as well as numerous requirements for property-related fees and charges such as utility fees and charges imposed by local governments.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, a California {{appellate court}} held that an in-lieu {{franchise}} fee for water, sewer, and refuse collection services was a “property-related” fee subject to Article XIII D.

2500|$|Section 1 {{definitions}} {{include the}} term “local government” setting forth the public entities {{subject to the}} article. [...] The term “local government” for purposes of Proposition 218 is very broadly defined to counter a previous narrow interpretation given by the California Supreme Court under Proposition 13 which created loopholes allowing local agencies to circumvent constitutional voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for taxes. [...] Government entities subject to Proposition 218 are local and regional governments, including counties, cities, a city and county, school districts, community college districts, public authorities, joint powers agencies, and special districts such as water districts or agencies. [...] The “local government” definition also expressly states that it includes charter cities having a local charter (similar to a local constitution) as their primary source of power.|$|E
2500|$|Section 2 of Article XIII C {{contains}} the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for local government taxes. [...] Under Proposition 218, every local government tax {{is either a}} general tax or a special tax. [...] Proposition 218 does not allow a local tax to be a hybrid tax. [...] The type of tax a local government imposes (general or special) is legally significant because it determines the applicable voter approval requirement. [...] Special purpose districts or agencies, including school districts, have no power to levy general taxes and can only impose special taxes. [...] This restriction is based on prior judicial interpretations of Proposition 13. [...] As a practical matter, only a city or a county {{has the power to}} levy a general tax under Proposition 218. [...] The voter approval requirement under Proposition 218 was upheld by a California appellate court.|$|E
2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In Commission v Germany the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E
