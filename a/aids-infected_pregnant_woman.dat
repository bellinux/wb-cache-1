40|$|Introduction: In pregnancy, women {{undergo a}} {{tremendous}} number of systemic and ocular changes. Physiological changes {{occur in the}} cardiovascular, hormonal, metabolic, hematologic and immunologic systems. Hormonal changes are among the most prominent systemic changes in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with the placenta, maternal endocrine glands and the fetal adrenal glands combining their productivity to make a high-powered hormone factory. Aims: To evaluate the various ocular changes taking place in pregnancy in women with no other co-morbid ocular or systemic diseases and to compare ocular changes in three trimesters of pregnancy with controls of non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Materials and Methods: The ocular changes occuring in varying stages of pregnancy in 225 <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were studied and compared with 75 healthy non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Results: Age was similar in the pregnant and non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> studied. Headache was significantly more common among <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> when compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Diplopia was not significantly different between pregnant and non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Intraocular pressure was significantly less among the <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> as compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Occurrence of conjunctival pigmentation was significantly more in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> when compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> There was no difference in corneal thickness when pregnant and non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were compared. Krukenberg's spindles were seen more commonly among <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> when compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Conclusion: Various ocular changes occur during a normal pregnancy. Knowledge of these changes can help to differentiate the physiological changes occurring in a normal pregnancy from ocular manifestation of systemic diseases.

40|$|Pregnancy is {{a period}} {{characterized}} by a supraphysiological hormonal status, and greater anxiety proneness, {{which can lead to}} peripartum affective symptoms with dramatic consequences not only for the woman but also for the child. Clinical psychiatry is heavily hampered by the paucity of objective and biology-based intermediate phenotypes. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, a neurophysiological measure of sensorimotor gating, has been poorly investigated in relation to anxiety and in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> In the present study, the PPI of healthy non-pregnant women (n = 82) and late <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> (n = 217) was investigated. Age, BMI, depression and anxiety symptoms, tobacco use, and antidepressant medication were considered. We investigated and provided evidence of lower PPI: (i) in healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> compared to healthy non-pregnant controls, (ii) in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with anxiety disorders compared to healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> (iii) in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with anxiety disorders using SSRI compared to un-medicated <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with anxiety disorders, and (iv) in healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> carrying the COMT Val 158 Met Val/Val genotype compared to Met carriers. Altogether, a reduced sensorimotor gating as an effect of supraphysiological hormonal status, anxiety disorders, SSRIs, and catecholaminergic genotype, implicate the putative relevance of lower PPI as an objective biological correlate of anxiety proneness in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> These findings call for prospective studies to dissect the multifactorial influences on PPI in relation to mental health of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: There {{has always}} been a {{reluctance}} to include <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical research, due to a fear of harm to the foetus. At the same time, {{there is a need for}} evidence-based information on medications and treatments for <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> who are or become ill during their pregnancy, which can only be gathered through research in the population of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> For this reason, inclusion of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> has been promoted in the last decades by bioethicists, pharmacologists, regulators and researchers. Yet despite efforts to include <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical research, they are still underrepresented. There are a number of open issues and it is likely that there are ethical reasons underlying the continuous underrepresentation of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Addressing these ethical reasons may change the status quo. The four main issues that are addressed in this thesis are: i) acceptable level of risk, ii) vulnerability, iii) fair inclusion, and iv) research design. The main objective of this thesis is to challenge the underrepresentation of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> by developing a normative framework specifying the conditions under which <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> could be included in clinical research. Methods: In this thesis we used an empirical-ethical approach, combining empirical data with normative reflection. Empirical study of established ethical issues may clarify the extent of real and perceived problems and the way people think about them in relation to inclusion of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical research. Normative evaluation of these problems may contribute to fair inclusion of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in research. The mixed-methods approach is supported by the sound methodology of the Normative-Empirical Reflective Equilibrium. Results: Through reflection on the four ethical issues and the main findings of this thesis we developed a normative framework in which we specify four normative considerations under which <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> may be included in clinical research: i) acceptable levels of risk for <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> should be formulated through a deliberative process balancing risks and benefits and the outcome should henceforth be respected, ii) <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> should only be deemed vulnerable when they encounter a higher exposure to risk due to a lack of scientific knowledge, iii) fair inclusion of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> implies that separate trials in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> should be promoted and that prioritising their research interests is a shared responsibility of all actors involved in the research process, and iv) <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> may be early included in the drug development process, provided that prerequisites and safety and efficacy data are adequately addressed and safeguarded throughout the process. Conclusions: With regard to the inclusion of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical research, this thesis has answered ethical questions relating to acceptable levels of risk, vulnerability, fair inclusion and research design. At the same time, we have indicated issues that may need further ethical exploration. As underrepresentation of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in itself remains an ethical issue, the way forward also requires a focus on the practical application of fair inclusion...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{factors and}} psychosocial profiles (e. g., stress, social support, and self esteem) of intimate partner violence (IPV) among <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Design: Descriptive comparative design Methods: The sample {{was comprised of}} 420 <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> who received their antenatal care visits at a university hospital in Bangkok. Data was collected {{through a set of}} structured questionnaires which were then analyzed by descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and independent t-test. Main Findings: Compared to non-abused <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> abused <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> rated significantly higher in areas of divorce, separation and remarriage, alcohol abuse, smoking, unplanned and unwanted pregnancy (p <. 05). They also had significantly shorter length of marriage, lower levels of education, and the greater number of gravidarum and abortion (p <. 05). Moreover, abused <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> had significantly higher stress, but lower social support and self-esteem than non-abused <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> (p <. 05). Conclusion and recommendations: Based on these findings, nurses should pay attention and increase awareness of IPV among <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> as well as perform universal screening of IPV aimed at reducing such violence experienced and negative health outcomes during pregnancy...|$|R

This study sets out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the SP given to the <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in some selected health facilities in the Central Region of Ghana to prevent maternal malaria in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> A total of 543 <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> recruited from 7 selected health centres in Central Region of Ghana participated in the study. Parasite density of Plasmodium falciparum was determined from peripheral blood of the <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> using microscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and dissolution tester were used to determine the quality of the SP. Malaria infection was recorded in 11. 2 % of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> who had a history of SP consumption. SP failed the dissolution test. <b>Pregnant</b> <b>women</b> who did not receive IPT-SP were 44 %.

40|$|Background: There is {{ambiguity}} {{with regard}} to what counts as an acceptable level of risk in clinical research in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> {{and there is no}} input from stakeholders relative to such research risks. The aim of our paper was to explore what stakeholders who are actively involved in the conduct of clinical research in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> deem an acceptable level of risk for <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical research. Accordingly, we used the APOSTEL VI study, a low-risk obstetrical randomised controlled trial, as a case-study. Methods: We conducted a prospective qualitative study using 35 in-depth semi-structured interviews and one focus group. We interviewed healthcare professionals, Research Ethics Committee members (RECs) and regulators who are actively involved in the conduct of clinical research in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> in addition to <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> recruited for the APOSTEL VI case-study in the Netherlands. Results: Three themes characterise the way stakeholders view risks in clinical research in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in general. Additionally, one theme characterises the way healthcare professionals and <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> view risks with respect to the case-study specifically. First, ideas on what constitutes an acceptable level of risk in general ranged from a preference for zero risk for the foetus up to minimal risk. Second, the desirability of clinical research in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in general was questioned altogether. Third, stakeholders proposed to establish an upper limit of risk in potentially beneficial clinical research in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> {{in order to protect the}} foetus and the <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> from harm. Fourth and finally, the case-study illustrates that healthcare professionals' individual perception of risk may influence recruitment. Conclusions: Healthcare professionals, RECs, regulators and <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> are all risk adverse in practice, possibly explaining the continuing underrepresentation of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical research. Determining the acceptable levels of risk on a universal level alone is insufficient, because the individual perception of risk also influences behaviour towards <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical research. Therefore, bioethicists and researchers might be interested in changing the perception of risk, which could be achieved by education and awareness about the actual benefits and harms of inclusion and exclusion of pregnant wome...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{number of}} people {{infected}} with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in China has increased in recent years. HIV screening for <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> was performed in a remote area in Xinjiang, {{as an effort to}} promote universal HIV screening in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> and to help prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Methods: <b>Pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in Burqin and Jeminay Counties in Xinjiang were offered free voluntary HIV screening. Local mid-level medical workers were trained to use Determine® HIV- 1 / 2 kit for HIV screening. All the tested <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> signed a consent form, received HIV education material, and participated in an HIV knowledge survey. Results: All the 890 <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> receiving HIV test had negative result. Among these women, 67. 6 % were Kazakh and 40. 9 % were farmers. Survey of HIV knowledge showed that these women's awareness about mother-to-child transmission was limited. The levels of HIV knowledge were related with ethnic background, age, education and profession of the <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Conclusion: The results suggested that HIV infection had not become a significant problem among the <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in this remote area of Xinjiang, but continued efforts to improve the awareness of HIV, especially the knowledge about mother-to-child transmission of HIV, in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were needed...|$|R
