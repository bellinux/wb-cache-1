Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

The theorist Satō Tetsutarō developed the doctrine that Japan should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US.

Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its evocation of the natural landscape and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was eager for the documentary detail Letters provided about America. The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E

Dragonetti's friendship with the composer Beethoven helped the latter to learn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> true <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> instrument.

The integration of a women 2 ̆ 7 s and gender studies course in the Ontario secondary school curriculum is a primary goal of this organization. All participants self-identified as feminist, and this identity interacted with and was affected by their activism. As well, it was expressed that their friendships and {{sense of belonging to}} a feminist community helped to sustain the project. The group used a collective approach to organizing, which developed organically, through their friendships with each other. Online communication was a key element of their organizing. The study also revealed that a two-pronged approach was used, as the group strived for legal change, while also working at a grassroots level to strengthen the support in schools for the course. At the curricular level, they saw that the interdisciplinary curriculum and the locally developed course option were spaces where women 2 ̆ 7 s and gender studies was being developed and thus supported these efforts.
