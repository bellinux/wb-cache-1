5|$|For {{his work}} on Itchy & Scratchy, Grampa is {{nominated}} for an award for Outstanding Writing in a Cartoon Series. When Grampa sees Itchy & Scratchy {{for the first time}} in a clip show introducing the award, he is <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> violent humor, and turns his acceptance speech into an assault on both the cartoon and the audience amused by it. He storms off the stage amidst boos and thrown vegetables. Grampa gives the award to Bart and Lisa, and Bart swears never to watch an award show again, unless Billy Crystal is featured.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} lenses {{required by}} the Fat Man had to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, {{as it was a}} former sawmill. Groves was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before it blew up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings about this, because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety.|$|E
5|$|In 64 emperor Nero {{appointed}} Gessius Florus as procurator of the Judaea Province. During his administration, the Jews were systematically {{discriminated against}} {{in favour of}} the Greek population of the region. Tensions quickly rose to civil unrest when Florus plundered the treasury of the Temple of Jerusalem {{under the guise of}} imperial taxes. Following riots, the instigators were arrested and crucified by the Romans. <b>Appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> treatment of her countrymen, Berenice travelled to Jerusalem in 66 to personally petition Florus to spare the Jews, but not only did he refuse to comply with her requests, Berenice herself was nearly killed during skirmishes in the city. Likewise a plea for assistance to the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, met with no response.|$|E

5|$|In November 1882, he {{left the}} Inconstant, spent Christmas in Darmstadt, and in March the {{following}} year visited his younger brother, Prince Alexander, in Bulgaria. Alexander had been made Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1879 {{with the approval of}} Europe's Great Powers. Louis accompanied his brother on a state visit to Turkey, and then on a tour of Cyprus and the Holy Land with the Turkish navy, during which Louis was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lack of seamanship—the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast so as not to get lost; when they did leave the coast they became so disoriented that they were unable to steer for Jaffa. On its return journey the ship on which they had travelled ran aground.|$|E
5|$|On {{the advice}} of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the Italian Peninsula could not be held without the {{assistance}} of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway. Kesselring was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as he was certain that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as Salerno. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez was a monarchist {{at heart}} and he despaired when King Louis XVI {{went to the}} {{guillotine}} on 21 January 1793. He found the political situation in Paris to be chaotic. He was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tendency of radicals to interfere with army commanders. Having already negotiated with the enemy, Dumouriez offered to treat and the Austrians sent Mack on 25 March. The French commander proposed to take the army and march on Paris. He would overthrow the National Convention, crush the Jacobins and restore the Constitution of 1791. For their part, the Austrians pledged to halt their advance while he carried out his coup. But Dumouriez moved too slowly. On 1 April, four commissioners and the War Minister Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville arrived at his headquarters to demand that the commander explain himself in Paris. They were seized and {{handed over to the}} Austrians.|$|E

50|$|The FilmBar {{theater in}} Downtown Phoenix {{reported}} a gross of just $9, meaning {{only one person}} bought a ticket to see the film. The film was pulled down by its distributors following its one weekend <b>appalling</b> performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> box office. In North America, it ended up becoming the lowest-grossing film of all time, surpassing the previous record held by I Kissed a Vampire ($1,380) in 2012.|$|R
5|$|Batista {{responded with}} an all-out-attack on Castro's guerrillas, Operation Verano (28 June to 8 August 1958). The army aerially bombarded forested areas and villages {{suspected}} of aiding the militants, while 10,000 soldiers {{under the command}} of General Eulogio Cantillo surrounded the Sierra Maestra, driving north to the rebel encampments. Despite their numerical and technological superiority, the army had no experience with guerrilla warfare or with the mountainous region. Now with 300 men at his command, Castro avoided open confrontation, using land mines and ambushes to halt the enemy offensive. The army suffered heavy losses and a number of embarrassments; in June 1958 a battalion surrendered, their weapons were confiscated and they were handed over to the Red Cross. Many of Batista's soldiers, <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> human rights abuses that they were ordered to carry out, defected to Castro's rebels, who also benefited from popular support in the areas they controlled. In the summer, the MR-26-7 went on the offensive, pushing the army back, out of the mountain range and into the lowlands, with Castro using his columns in a pincer movement to surround the main army concentration in Santiago. By November, Castro's forces controlled most of Oriente and Las Villas, and tightened their grip around the capitals of Santiago and Santa Clara. Through control of Las Villas, the rebels divided Cuba in two by closing major roads and rail lines, severely disadvantaging Batista's forces.|$|E
25|$|Mutual {{distrust}} between English and French Freemasons {{was apparent}} in the 1850s, when French Masonic refugees were <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> relationship between UGLE and the Monarchy, aristocracy, and the Anglican church. The English distrusted the mysticism of French Masonry, and its ideals of Fraternity and Universality.|$|E
25|$|Susan, like Cinderella, is {{undergoing}} a transition from one phase of her life to another. Lewis didn't approve of that. He didn't like women in general, or sexuality at all, {{at least at the}} stage in his life when he wrote the Narnia books. He was frightened and <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> notion of wanting to grow up.|$|E
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, {{located in}} The Hague, has found several {{individuals}} guilty {{of crimes against}} humanity perpetrated at Omarska. Murder, torture, rape, and abuse of prisoners was common. Around 6,000 Bosniaks and Croats were held in <b>appalling</b> conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camp for about five months {{in the spring and}} summer of 1992, including 37 women.

6000|$|I amused {{myself for}} a moment {{with the thought of}} Miss Penny's conversion--Miss Penny confronting a vast {{assembly}} of Fathers of the Church, rattling her earrings at their discourses on the Trinity, laughing her <b>appalling</b> laugh <b>at</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, meeting the stern look of the Grand Inquisitor with a flash of her bright, emotionless hare's eyes. What was the secret of the woman's formidableness? ...|$|R
60|$|The fact is, {{that soon}} after my arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cottage there had {{occurred}} to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it {{so much of the}} portentous character, that I might well have been excused for regarding it as an omen. It <b>appalled,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time so confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.|$|R
25|$|On a {{visit of}} {{inspection}} to {{the settlement of}} Hobart Town on the Derwent River in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in November 1811, Macquarie was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ramshackle arrangement {{of the town and}} ordered the government surveyor James Meehan to survey a regular street layout. This survey determined the form of the current centre of the city of Hobart.|$|E
25|$|For all her censures of Communism, however, West {{was hardly}} an {{uncritical}} {{supporter of the}} Western democracies. Thus in 1919–1920, she excoriated the U.S. government for deporting Goldman and for the infamous Palmer raids. She was also <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> failure of Western democracies {{to come to the}} aid of Republican Spain, and she gave money to the Republican cause.|$|E
25|$|Kitri, an inn-keeper's daughter, steals out of {{her house}} to meet her beloved, the barber Basilio. Her father, Lorenzo, sees the lovers and sends Basilio away, {{bringing}} Kitri to tears. Now comes the rich nobleman Gamache, who, likewise in love with Kitri, goes to Lorenzo and asks for his daughter's hand. The innkeeper accepts with delight but Kitri, <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thought of wedding the foppish nobleman, runs away.|$|E
5000|$|The {{defining}} {{condition for}} the women’s dirty protest, however, had not to do with bathing or using the restroom, but with a thing which comes naturally: the menstrual cycle. While Ireland and <b>the</b> world was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> how <b>the</b> men <b>at</b> Long-Kesh were living {{day in and day}} out, the presence of such an intimate and inherently sexual bodily fluid direct contrasted with the pure, model Irish women which Irish Republican activists were intended to illustrate. Indeed, even the mention of menstruation caused outrage in the guards and other men who came into contact with the issue, whether in person or in passing: ...|$|R
5000|$|Justice Douglas {{responded to}} the Miller majority's {{argument}} that the First Amendment necessarily incorporated the common-law strictures on obscenity that existed at that time. James Madison, in drafting the Bill of Rights, intended for them to apply strictly to the federal government. [...] "Tying censorship to the movement of literature or films in interstate commerce or into foreign commerce {{would have been an}} easy way for a government of delegated powers to impair the liberty of expression. It was to bar such suppression that we have the First Amendment. I daresay Jefferson and Madison would be <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> what <b>the</b> Court espouses today." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{timing was}} serendipitous. Just {{a few weeks}} earlier, Miller had taken his young daughters to a {{performance}} of Babes In Toyland <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Alex Theatre [...] in Glendale, California and he was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> how pandering <b>the</b> show was to its young audience. The thought crossed his mind, “if I ever ran a children’s theatre group, we would do smart shows.” So when the children’s theatre opportunity presented itself a few weeks later, he felt the call.|$|R
25|$|Both {{during and}} after the war, Benedict was {{primarily}} concerned about the fate of the children, about which he even issued an encyclical. In 1916 he appealed to the people and clergy of the United States to help him feed the starving children in German-occupied Belgium. His aid to children was not limited to Belgium but extended to children in Lithuania, Poland, Lebanon, Montenegro, Syria and Russia. Benedict was particularly <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new military invention of aerial warfare and protested several times against it to no avail.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} that raged for years was over allowable instrumentation, especially {{the use of}} drums and electrically amplified instruments. Some purists were <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prospect; traditionally a string bass provided the rhythm component in country music and percussion instruments were seldom used. Electric amplification, then new, was regarded as the province of popular music and jazz in 1940s. Though the Opry allowed electric guitars and steel guitars by World War II, the restrictions against drums and horns continued. They caused a conflict when Bob Wills and Pee Wee King defied the show's ban on drums.|$|E

Graves expressed his concerns about Site S to Captain William S. (Deak) Parsons, a Navy officer who was in charge of O (for ordnance) Division at Los Alamos. Parsons recommended establishing another explosives plant. While Site S had the capacity to produce enough explosive lenses for one or two bombs per month, more might be required.|$|E
25|$|These {{events were}} preceded by an exposé in the Daily Dispatch {{newspaper}} over <b>the</b> allegedly <b>appalling</b> conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hospital. Madlala-Routledge first {{paid a visit}} to the hospital, which had not been scheduled nor communicated to the hospital, and after her report, Msimang subsequently paid a scheduled and announced visit to the hospital.

25|$|After Stanley secured {{employment}} at the European Commission, {{he moved his}} family to Brussels in April 1973, where they settled in Uccle and Johnson became fluent in French. Charlotte had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised with clinical depression, with Johnson and his siblings being sent to Ashdown House preparatory boarding school in East Sussex in 1975. There he developed a love of rugby and excelled at Ancient Greek and Latin; he was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> teachers' use of corporal punishment. Meanwhile, Stanley and Charlotte's relationship broke down in December 1978 and they divorced in 1980. Charlotte moved into a flat in Notting Hill, where her children spent {{much of their time}} with her.|$|E
25|$|Despite his obvious {{moments of}} {{whimsical}} charm and offbeat humour, {{accompanied by his}} manic grin, the Fourth Doctor is more aloof and somber than his previous incarnations. He can become intensely brooding, serious and even callous. He also displays a darker edge to his personality, and in The Invasion of Time he seems to cruelly taunt and play with the Time Lords after his emergency inauguration as President. He also has a strong moral code, as when he faces the dilemma of whether to destroy the Daleks in (Genesis of the Daleks), stating that if he did, he would be no better himself than the Daleks. He is truly <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> actions of the Pirate Captain in The Pirate Planet and refuses to listen to Professor Tryst's attempts to justify drug-running to fund his scientific work (Nightmare of Eden), simply telling him to go away.|$|E
25|$|In September 1921 Dhalla, {{accompanied}} by {{his wife and son}} (Nariman, who would eventually also study at Columbia), again proceeded to New York, this time to have his book Zoroastrian Civilization published. On the way, the family also spent four months in Iran and Iraq, where Dhalla again gave a series of lectures. Although Dhalla was <b>appalled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> living conditions (not just of Zoroastrians), he found that the still-medieval infrastructure afforded him with opportunities for closer contacts with the people that he would have had with more modern forms of transportation. In New York, Dhalla delivered lectures whenever the opportunity arose. Following the publication of his book, Dhalla and family returned to Karachi via London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Rome, and Naples, and felt the effects of the war that had ended only three years previously. Following a five-week layover in Bombay, they returned to Karachi in July 1922.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the plan}} quickly goes awry: the ship Napoleon is serving on {{abruptly}} changes its itinerary and docks in Belgium instead of France. Having {{to make his}} way to France by land (and gaining an <b>appalling</b> look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tourist trap the Battlefield of Waterloo has become), he is finally met <b>at</b> <b>the</b> French border by a loyal agent, Sgt. Bommell (Clive Russell), formerly of the French Imperial Guard. Bommell gives him the name of another agent in Paris he can trust, Lt. Truchaut.|$|R
50|$|Shankar {{admired the}} artistry and musicianship {{of some of}} his fellow {{performers}} on the three-day program, particularly Simon & Garfunkel, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Otis Redding. He was <b>appalled,</b> however, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight of Hendrix setting fire to his electric guitar, and by the Who's destruction of their instruments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of their set. As a result, Shankar initially refused to take the stage. He was placated once the organisers rescheduled his set for the final day, a Sunday, when no other acts would be playing.|$|R
2500|$|Allied {{attempts}} {{to stem the}} advance {{in the wake of}} the Battle of Dunkirk (see also Evacuation of Dunkirk) by bombing the advancing German forces [...] failed with heavy losses. On 14 May 1940, a day the Luftwaffe called [...] "the day of the fighters", Allied bombers attempted to halt the Wehrmacht crossing the Meuse river, but inadequately protected they suffered <b>appalling</b> losses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hands of Luftwaffe fighters. Over 120 Bf 109s destroyed as many French and British aircraft (90 of which were bombers) in the day's fighting.|$|R
