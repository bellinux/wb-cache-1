The role of one {{argument in}} <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> another and the propagation <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> backings [...] 4. Context sensitive defeasible rules [...] 5. Conclusion. Abstract argumentation frameworks {{are used to}} study various aspects of interaction between arguments. One most fundamental such interaction is that some arguments may attack some other arguments. In a sense, only those arguments finally matter that are successfully defended against the attackers. Such arguments are called admissible. This thesis incorporates three papers {{in this area of}} research, two of which are devoted to the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> arguments. The first paper introduces the notion <b>of</b> the <b>admissibility</b> backing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> argument – <b>a</b> minimal set <b>of</b> admissible arguments that can successfully defend (respectively attack) a given argument against its attackers (defenders). This paper shows how admissible backings can help us localize the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> argument. It does so by separating those arguments that are relevant to the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given argument from those that are not. Independent corroboration for this approach is provided by showing how major results in Dung’s approach to argumentation can be obtained using admissibility backings. The second paper explores the propagation <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> backings in the following sense: under what condition, and in what way, <b>an</b> <b>admissibility</b> backing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given argument will contribute to the backing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different argument? It is shown that under certain conditions, the propagation is transitive. It is further shown how the propagation <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> backings can be used to partition an argumentation framework to independent sub-frameworks. This is indicative <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interesting approach to the splitting and merging of different argumentation frameworks, <b>a</b> theoretical investigation <b>of</b> which is left for future research. The last paper explores a novel approach to marrying the argumentation frameworks to defeasible reasoning. The desired goal behind this approach is that an argument that is deemed justied in an argumentation framework should indeed satisfy our expectations as per defeasible reasoning. The efficacy of this approach is shown by providing a mapping from it to Dung’s argumentation framework. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xx, 235 pages...|$|R

40|$|In Colorado v. Connelly the Supreme Court {{held that}} police {{misconduct}} {{is necessary for}} an inadmissible confession. Since the Connelly decision, courts and scholars have framed the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> confession {{in terms of whether}} it successfully deters future police misconduct. As <b>a</b> result, the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> confession turns largely on whether U. S. police acted poorly, and only after overcoming this threshold have courts considered factors pointing to the reliability and voluntariness of the confession. In the international context, this translates into the routine and almost mechanic admission of confessions— even when there is clear indication that the confession is coerced or unreliable. Confessions obtained by foreign officers seldom meet the Connelly threshold because the United States has neither the ability, nor the goal, of controlling foreign police conduct. In light of the international context, courts should reexamine the Connelly test, which is not in line with the fundamental ideals of justice and fairness that the U. S. Constitution protects. Courts should tailor a test focused on the reliability of the confession {{in order to protect the}} defendant’s fundamental rights...|$|R
40|$|The {{most recent}} {{amendments}} {{to most of}} the provisions of the Polish matrimonial property law (2005) and the new contents of article 47 § 1 of Polish family and guardianship code support the claim {{that there is a need}} for <b>a</b> new construction <b>of</b> this legislation.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of {{sequentially}} testing {{the hypothesis that the}} mean <b>of</b> <b>a</b> normal distribution <b>of</b> known variance is {{less than or equal to}} a given value versus the alternative that it is greater than the given value. Impose the linear combination loss function under which the risk becomes a constant c, times the expected sample size, plus the probability of error.
