However, {{in the city}} of Glendale, California, where Armenians compose 27% of city's total population, only 17% of the crime in the city were committed by Armenians in 2006. A gang named Armenian Power, composed of some 200 Armenian Americans, has operated in Los Angeles County since the late 1980s.|$|E

5|$|During the Principate, {{recruitment}} {{into the}} legions {{was restricted to}} Roman citizens only. This rule, which derived from the pre-Social War Republican army, was strictly enforced.

5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such <b>as</b> <b>during</b> the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the Air Board again assumed {{full control}} of all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, having been re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries <b>as</b> <b>during</b> the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

5|$|However, {{conscription}} was not {{in practice}} universal. Firstly, a land-based levy meant recruits were exclusively the sons of peasants, as opposed to townspeople. Thus some 20% of the empire's population was excluded. In addition, <b>as</b> <b>during</b> the Principate, slaves were not admissible. Nor were freedmen and persons in certain occupations such as bakers and innkeepers. In addition, provincial officials and curiales (city council members) could not enlist. These rules were relaxed only in emergencies, <b>as</b> <b>during</b> the military crisis of 405–6 (Radagaisus' invasion of Italy and the great barbarian invasion of Gaul). Most importantly, the conscription requirement was often commuted into a cash levy, at a fixed rate per recruit due. This was done for certain provinces, in certain years, although the specific details are largely unknown. It appears from the very slim available evidence that conscription was not applied evenly across provinces but concentrated heavily in the army's traditional recruiting areas of Gaul (including the two Germaniae provinces along the Rhine) and the Danubian provinces, with other regions presumably often commuted. An analysis of the known origins of comitatenses in the period 350–476 shows that in the Western army, the Illyricum and Gaul dioceses together provided 52% of total recruits. Overall, the Danubian regions provided {{nearly half of the}} whole army's recruits, despite containing only three of the 12 dioceses. This picture is much in line with the 2nd-century position.|$|E

During Mawlid—the holiday honoring the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad—Zalabieh which consists of small, crunchy deep fried dough balls in dipped in syrup, is served.

5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; <b>as</b> <b>during</b> her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E
5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such <b>as</b> <b>during</b> a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} large pressure differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|Scottish white terriers were {{recorded}} as early <b>as</b> <b>during</b> {{the reign of}} James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625.

Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak. At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.|$|E

5|$|The K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally {{that has}} been {{calculated}} <b>as</b> <b>during</b> the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts.

The city was dominated by the K'iche' until the Spanish Conquest of the early 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very {{controversial}} in the West and was {{singled out for}} criticism by the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such <b>as</b> <b>during</b> a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E

5|$|The area is {{also home}} to many desserts, ranging from those made {{regularly}} and those that are commonly reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such <b>as</b> <b>during</b> Ramadan, where carob, tamarind and apricot juices are consumed at sunset. Coffee is consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians and less conservative Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Palestine have varied throughout history. The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River Jordan) has at times formed {{a political and}} administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories. At other times, such <b>as</b> <b>during</b> certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states for example, as well <b>as</b> <b>during</b> the biblical period, territories {{on both sides of}} the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin.|$|E
