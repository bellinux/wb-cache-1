She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E

Lie remained active in Norwegian public life, even after his 100th birthday, and in 2008 he celebrated his 103rd birthday with the release of a new biography, [...] "Slik jeg ser det nå" [...] (<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it now).|$|E

He differed from Yeats and Lady Gregory on what he believed the Irish theatre should be, as he wrote to Stephen MacKenna:I do not believe in the possibility of [...] "a purely fantastic, unmodern, ideal, breezy, spring-dayish, Cuchulainoid National Theatre" ... no drama can grow out of anything other than the fundamental realities of life, which are never fantastic, are neither modern nor unmodern and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> them, rarely spring-dayish, or breezy or Cuchulanoid.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, McCay {{attended}} a dinner {{in his honor}} in New York. [...] After {{a considerable amount of}} drinking, McCay was introduced by animator Max Fleischer. [...] McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated his audience, saying, [...] "Animation is an art. [...] That is how I conceived it. [...] But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see,</b> what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. [...] Not an art, but a trade. [...] Bad Luck!" [...] That September he appeared on the radio at WNAC, and on November 2 he was interviewed by Frank Craven for The Evening Journals Woman's Hour. [...] During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation.|$|E
500|$|On {{their way}} back to Salzburg Leopold and Wolfgang stayed for a while at Venice, pausing on their way at Brescia to see an opera buffa. While in Venice, Leopold used his letters of {{introduction}} to meet the nobility and to negotiate a contract for Wolfgang to write an opera for the San Benedetto theatre. Wolfgang gave several concerts and perhaps played at Venice's famed ospidali—former orphanages [...] which became respected music academies. The Mozarts were received generously, but Leopold appeared dissatisfied. [...] "The father seems a shade piqued", wrote a correspondent to the Viennese composer Johann Adolph Hasse, adding: [...] "...they probably expected others to seek after them, rather than they after others". Hasse replied: [...] "The father, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> the man, is equally discontent everywhere".|$|E

500|$|The same {{search for}} direct intuition and {{understanding}} {{can be seen}} with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to [...] "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God." [...] He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come [...] "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) {{and asked if he}} had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said [...] "My boy, you have the Yogis eyes." [...] According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying [...] "Yes, I see Him <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> you, only in an infinitely intenser sense." [...] Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna. It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen studied Renaissance {{polyphony}} closely, {{which accounts}} {{for some of the}} melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his Tre Motetter (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a neo-classical sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer Robert Simpson called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of acciacaturas or appoggiaturas, or his frequent use of a flattened seventh and minor third in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote [...] "The intervals, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music... t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note." ...|$|E

500|$|Malone {{stated that}} Todd {{believes}} {{that he does not}} deserve forgiveness, which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities, something Malone felt worked better due to Howarth's acting choices, which prevented Todd from acquiring redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact he initiated her rape. As well as having Todd risk his freedom from prison and save Marty from a car crash, Todd donates his own blood to Marty to ensure she survives. A year later, he risks his life to save Patrick, Marty's lover, from death; this act leads to Todd's presumed death. Despite having the character yearn to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt his good deeds should never make him feel any less horrible for having raped Marty. [...] Initially, Howarth disagreed, and did not consider the storylines to be redemptive. [...] " [...] not being redeemed at all," [...] he said. [...] "Todd, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it, is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again. From now on, his menace will be on the surface, not exploding. It's more interesting if his violence is on the surface and that he play against it. That's where the subtlety is." ...|$|E
