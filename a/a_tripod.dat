5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail to act as <b>a</b> <b>tripod.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burial 69 {{was found}} {{in front of the}} base of Group 18 Structure 2. The remains were {{extremely}} poorly preserved but the deceased may have been laid out on their back with the head towards the north. Associated funerary offerings included <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> plate, a polychrome vase and a flint projectile point. The burial was securely dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{typically}} had <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> foremast with a pole mainmast. To {{improve the}} anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they {{were similar to}} the larger s that immediately preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.|$|E

5|$|The guns {{on top of}} Cochranes {{centreline}} 9.2-inch turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder guns on the superstructure were removed during 1917 {{as well as the}} guns on top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Cochranes foremast was converted to <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> mast to support the weight of a fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{on top of}} 'A' and 'Y' turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder guns on the {{superstructure}} were removed during 1917 {{as well as the}} guns on top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Some of these guns were landed at Murmansk while she was based there. Seventeen 3-pounders were on board when she was lost in 1919, but it is unclear if that total includes the AA guns. Cochranes foremast was converted to <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> mast to support the weight of a fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|E
5|$|The pole {{foremast}} {{was modified}} to <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> after 1916. This {{was due to}} the increased weight of masthead fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 Lion and Princess Royal received searchlight towers on the aft funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from the aft battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on 'Q' and 'X' turrets for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft, and Lion was fitted with a torpedo control station at the aft end of her aft superstructure.|$|E

5|$|The {{work was}} carried out in an empty room of Okada's house where their {{business}} was also operated. While other people were present, the work was shared and Anno, Akai and Yamaga worked full-time on the production, the direction was not professional, but Takeada attributed Okada as the producer, with Yamaga directing, Akai doing character animation and Anno as the mecha animator. Takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed, but still credits Yamaga, Akai and Anno with the production itself. Filming was done by a camera on <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> and frames were called out by Anno because the production lacked timing sheets.|$|E

And it weighs 9 marcs 3 ounces of gold. and the said hanap rests on a stand of gold {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>tripod,</b> {{and in the middle of}} the tripod is represented Our Lady in a sun on a ground of clear red, and the three feet of the tripod are formed by three winged dragons. The said hanap and cover were given to the king by monseigneur the duc de Berry on his journey into Touraine in the year 91.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E

5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of <b>a</b> <b>tripod.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pottery steamer: Archaeological {{excavations}} {{show that}} using steam to cook {{began with the}} pottery cooking vessels known as yan steamers; a yan composed of two vessel, a zeng with perforated floor surmounted on a pot or caldron with <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> base and a top cover. The earliest yan steamer dating from about 5000 BC was unearthed in the Banpo site. In the lower Yangzi River, zeng pots {{first appeared in the}} Hemudu culture (5000–4500 BC) and Liangzhu culture (3200–2000 BC) and used to steam rice; there are also yan steamers unearthed in several Liangzhu sites, including 3 found at the Chuodun and Luodun sites in southern Jiangsu. In the Longshan culture (3000–2000 BC) site at Tianwang in western Shandong, 3 large yan steamers were discovered.|$|E
5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to <b>a</b> <b>tripod,</b> with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap and easy to manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E

5|$|Bretagne {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Brest on 1 July 1912, {{launched}} on 21 April 1913, and completed in September 1915. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 February 1916. After entering service in 1916, Bretagne and her sisters {{were assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, their unit {{for the remainder of the}} war, Bretagne becoming flagship of the squadron. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Bretagne saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917, due to a severe shortage of coal at Corfu. Around July 1918, the ship's foremast was replaced by <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> foremast that mounted an experimental fire-control director and her mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive kite balloon. Bretagne returned to Toulon in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not <b>a</b> <b>tripod.</b> The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus was {{converted}} to the prototype fighter catapult ship in November 1940, carrying three Fairey Fulmar fighters from 807 Squadron between 1 December and 10 February 1941, which {{were replaced by}} aircraft from 804 Squadron between 10 February and 23 July. These fighters were supposed to defend convoys against attacks from Focke-Wulf Fw 200 maritime patrol bombers and {{to prevent them from}} radioing location reports to U-boats. If out of range of land, the fighters would have to ditch at sea and hope to be recovered by a ship from their convoy. The ship escorted nine convoys between December 1940 and July 1941. At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was supplemented with a pair of Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns mounted in the bow, the ship's bridge was enlarged and the mast was replaced with <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> mast bearing a Type 291 air warning radar. The ship then became a seaplane training ship again, hosting 763 Squadron aboard from 20 April 1942 to 13 February 1944. Pegasus then became a barracks ship until May 1946 and was then listed for disposal in June.|$|E

5|$|Structure 4 is {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although {{the roof of the}} temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.|$|E
5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing <b>a</b> <b>Tripod</b> harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel {{and a number of other}} prisoners. As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Duke of Edinburgh was {{attached}} to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and remained at sea until 2 June, searching for disabled ships. She arrived in Scapa Flow on the afternoon of 3 June. On the evening of 18 August 1916, the Grand Fleet, including Duke of Edinburgh, put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. After Jutland the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, now including Duke of Edinburgh, was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders. The ship's foremast was converted to <b>a</b> <b>tripod</b> to support the weight of a fire-control director in May 1917, but when the director was actually fitted is not known. Two more 6-inch guns were added in embrasures on the forecastle deck during that same refit. She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties, where she remained {{for the duration of the}} war. Upon her return, Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the Humber, before she was sold for scrap on 12 April 1920 and broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.|$|E
