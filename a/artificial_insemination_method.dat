40|$|A novel {{method of}} sperm {{preparation}} by direct collection from the cauda epididymis and vas deferens of male rabbits is suggested and validated for improved artificial insemination efficiency in rabbits. Although, conventional methods in which sperm for artificial insemination are prepared using an artificial vagina {{have been well}} established in many laboratories due to its benefits over natural mating, this new method eliminates the existing disadvantages of the conventional semen preparation. To compare the quality of sperm collected using an artificial vagina with that retrieved directly from the cauda epididymis, motion parameters of sperm were analyzed with a computer-assisted sperm analyzer. Additionally, after 20 adult females were inseminated artificially with sperm derived from the cauda epididymis, all live dams were subjected to caesarean section on day 28 of gestation and their fetuses were examined for external, visceral and skeletal abnormalities. All data were compared to those of dams impregnated by the traditional <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>method</b> in which the semen was prepared with an artificial vagina. No significant difference was observed in any criteria examined between the new and traditional preparation methods.

50|$|Human {{reproduction}} is {{any form of}} sexual reproduction resulting in human fertilization, typically involving sexual intercourse {{between a man and}} a woman. During sexual intercourse, the interaction between the male and female reproductive systems results in fertilization of the woman's ovum by the man's sperm. These are specialized reproductive cells called gametes, created in a process called meiosis. While normal cells contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, gamete cells only contain 23 chromosomes, and it is when these two cells merge into one zygote cell that genetic recombination occurs and the new zygote contains 23 chromosomes from each parent, giving them 23 pairs. After a gestation period, typically for nine months, is followed by childbirth.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a spectrophotometric method for the measurement of spermatozoa concentration corrected by the seminal particle/spermatozoa ratio. For this purpose 360 ejaculates were collected from 36 rabbit bucks. The semen samples were divided into three groups based on their particle/spermatozoa ratio subjectively determined by microscopic viewing. The spermatozoa concentration of each semen sample was evaluated by spectrophotometer and these results were compared with those obtained by using a haemotocytometer. The results of the standard spectrophotometric method were correlated with the results of the haemotocytometer count of spermatozoa (r= 0. 76; P< 0. 01). When the optical density was corrected by considering the P/S ratio, the correlation values greatly improved (r= 0. 94; P< 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) using frozen-thawed semen is well {{established}} and routinely used for breeding in various mammalian species. However, there is no report {{of the birth of}} elephant calves following AI with frozen-thawed semen. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the fertilizing ability of chilled and frozen-thawed semen in the Asian elephant following <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI). <b>Methods</b> Semen samples were collected by from 8 bulls (age range, 12 -to 42 -years) by manual stimulation. Semen with high quality were either cooled to 4 °C or frozen in liquid nitrogen (- 196 °C) before being used for AI. Blood samples collected from ten elephant females (age range, 12 -to 52 -years) were assessed for estrus cycle and elephants with normal cycling were used for AI. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> series were conducted during 2003 to 2008; 55 and 2 AI trials were conducted using frozen-thawed and chilled semen, respectively. Pregnancy was detected using transrectal ultrasonography and serum progestagen measurement. Results One female (Khod) inseminated with chilled semen became pregnant and gave birth in 2007. The gestation length was 663 days and the sex of the elephant calf was male. One female (Sao) inseminated with frozen-thawed semen showed signs of pregnancy by increasing progestagen levels and a fetus was observed for 5 months by transrectal ultrasonography.

40|$|Reproductive {{failure is}} {{a major source of}} {{economic}} loss in the beef industry. The majority of this loss occurs because cows do not become pregnant during a defined breeding season. Therefore, the goal of any breeding program is to maximize the number of females that become pregnant. This means that fertility {{plays a major role in}} the success of any breeding program. There are several methods by which fertility can be measured: 1) conception rates (number of animals pregnant/number of animals inseminated), 2) pregnancy rates (number of animals pregnant/number of animals available for breeding), and 3) calving rates (number of animals calved/number of animals available for breeding). This review will focus on the factors that affect pregnancy rates during the breeding season in both natural service and artificial breeding programs. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> provides a <b>method</b> to inseminate a large number of females to a single sire that has been selected/proven to be an industry leader for economically relevant traits. Thus, genetic change in a herd can occur quickly through the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination.</b> With natural service, herd bulls are also selected for economically relevant traits but are limited on the number of cows/heifers they can service during the breeding season. During the breeding season, a herd bull’s job is to detect cows/heifers in standing estrus and breed them at the appropriate time. For successful <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> of cattle to occur, the producer (herd manager) must take the place of the herd bull in detecting the cows/heifers that are ready to be inseminated. Since pregnancy rates are a product of both estrous detection rates and conception rates, comparisons must be made between synchronized and non-synchronized cows bred by natural service or by <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{biological}} events must occur before pregnancy can be established. Female cattle are anoestrus after parturition and cannot become pregnant. Once animals begin to cycle, then the oestrous cycle can be effectively controlled through hormonal treatments. Multiple drugs {{can be delivered}} into the vagina by plastic devices that contain physical pumps. These new devices will decrease animal handling before insemination. New chemical formulations may make synchronisation products easier to use as well. Classical technologies for oestrous detection depend on mounting activity of cows. Newer methods of electronic oestrous detection measure the number of mounts that each cow receives. More modern approaches to oestrous detection capitalise on animal biology instead of the behavioural patterns of the cow. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> is widely practiced in animal agriculture.

The beneficiaries of <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> {{are women who}} desire {{to give birth to}} their own child who may be in a lesbian relationship, single women or women who are in a heterosexual relationship but with a male partner who suffers from male infertility. Intracervical insemination (ICI) is the easiest and most common insemination technique and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance. Compared with natural insemination (i.e., insemination by sexual intercourse), <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> can be more expensive and more invasive, and may require professional assistance.|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies {{highlight}} the nontransitive properties of ejaculates {{when they are in}} competition to fertilize a female's eggs. Increasingly, these studies suggest that postcopulatory processes act as a filter against sperm from closely related males or those with similar genotypes, limiting the deleterious effects of inbreeding on offspring fitness. We investigated the potential for such postcopulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a promiscuous livebearing fish. We used <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> as a <b>method</b> of delivering to a female the combined ejaculates from a first cousin (relatedness coefficient r = 0. 125) and an unrelated male. This method of sperm delivery controls behavioral processes of pre- and postcopulatory female choice, which can bias paternity toward unrelated males. Our genetic analysis revealed no effect of parental relatedness on paternity outcomes. The observed mean paternity share for related males (0. 47) and associated variance did not differ significantly from an expected binomial distribution that assumes no biased use of sperm with respect to relatedness (0. 5). Although our data provide no evidence for postcopulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance, the ability of female guppies to influence ejaculate transfer and retention offers an alternative and easily testable mechanism of inbreeding avoidance in this species. 7 page(s...|$|R
