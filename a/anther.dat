5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and <b>anther.</b> The <b>anther</b> is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|Durio {{sensu lato}} has 30 {{recognised}} species. Durio sensu stricto comprises 24 of these species. The 6 species included in Durio s.l. are now {{considered by some}} to comprise their own genus, Boschia. Durio s.s. and Boschia have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial {{difference between the two}} is that <b>anther</b> locules open by apical pores in Boschia and by longitudinal slits in Durio s.s. These two genera form a clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae, Cullenia. These three genera together form a clade that is characterized by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.|$|E
5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the <b>anther,</b> transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
40|$|Decreased larval {{feeding and}} weight of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus L., have been {{detected}} after 4 d of exposure in the laboratory to a high density of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) -expressing <b>anthers.</b> One hypothesis is that larvae exposed to Bt <b>anthers</b> exhibit increased wandering, resulting in less feeding and lower weight gain. To test this hypothesis, 2 -d-old monarch butterfly larvae exposed to milkweed leaf disks with no <b>anthers,</b> <b>anthers</b> that express Bt (Cry 1 Ab, event MON 810), or other non-Bt <b>anthers</b> were observed using a video-tracking system. As had been shown in previous studies, larvae exposed to Btanthers fed less and gained less weight than larvae exposed to non-Bt or no <b>anthers,</b> yet {{there was no evidence}} of feeding on <b>anthers.</b> Total distance moved, maximum displacement from release point, percentage of time spent moving or near <b>anthers,</b> or mean turn angle did not differ across treatments. However, larvae exposed to Bt <b>anthers</b> spent more time off milkweed leaf disks than those exposed to no <b>anthers</b> and were more likely to move off the leaf than larvae exposed to non-Bt <b>anthers.</b> Results suggest that larvae exposed to Bt <b>anthers</b> behave differently and that ingestion may not be the only way Bt can affect nontarget insects like the monarch butterfly...|$|R

5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the <b>anther</b> lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the <b>anther,</b> which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
25|$|Self Pollination is {{the type}} of Pollination in which pollen grains are {{transferred}} from <b>anther</b> to the stigma of the same flower (Autogamy) or pollen grains are transferred from <b>anther</b> to the stigma of different flower of the same plant (Geitonogamy).|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{relation}} between pollen sterility and free amino acids of <b>anthers</b> in the asynaptic wild senna was studied by paper chromatography. In 1958, no proline was detected in <b>anthers</b> of asynaptic plant, while a very distinct yellow spot of proline was showed in those of normal one (Table 1). In 1959, the studies on four stages (pollen tetrad stage, young micro-spore stage, old micro-spore stage and pollen stage) of <b>anthers</b> and pistils of the normal plant and the asynaptic one were carried out in order to ascertain the result of last year (Table 2). No chromatographic differences, either qualitative or quantitative, could be detected visually between normal and sterile <b>anthers</b> (or pistils) at the pollen tetrad stage. In both of <b>anthers</b> and pistils, no proline was especially detected in this stage. At young micro-spore stage of <b>anthers,</b> a very yellow spot of proline was detected in both of the asynaptic and the normal materials. Nevertheless, no yellow spot of proline was detected in <b>anthers</b> (one day prior to bloom) of the asynaptic plant. In pistils both of the normal and the asynaptic plants, faint yellow spot of proline was showed at young micro-spore stage, but no yellow spot of proline was detected at one day prior to bloom. The quantity of glutamic acid was remarkably more in pistils than in <b>anthers.</b> In general, through the four stages, the quantity of asparagine and glutamine were larger in <b>anthers</b> than in pistils, while that of glutamic acid was remarkably more in pistils than in <b>anthers.</b> But {{it seems likely that}} there are no relation between these free amino acids and amide and the sterility. From the result of chromatogram, the author assumed that there would be some relation between proline and sterile <b>anthers</b> of the asynaptic wild senna. 最近細胞質による雄性不稔のコムギおよびトウモロコシの葯(以下花粉を含む) におけるプロリンの含量は,ごく微量かまたはほとんど認められない程度であることが明らかにされた(Fukazawa, 1954; KhooandStinson, 1957). また生理的原因による不稔イネの葯にもプロリンは存在しないとされている(尾崎・田井, 1957). 不稔個体の葯とプロリンとのこのような関係をさらに確かめるため,筆者は遺伝的染色体不対合現象による不稔エビスグサを用いて, 1958, 2 ̆ 759 の両年にわたりぺーパークロマトグラフィによつて,病中の遊離アミノ酸とくにプロリンについて検索を行なつた. 本研究遂行に当り,種々の助言と指導を賜わり,かつ校閲の労をとられた永松,船津両に対して深甚な謝意を表する...|$|R

The large corona allows the bees to crawl into the {{perianth}} {{but then the}} narrow tube prevents further progres, causing them to probe deeply for nectar. The pendant flowers prevent pollination by lepidoptera. In N. albimarginatus there may be either a long stigma with short and mid length <b>anthers</b> or a short stigma and long <b>anthers</b> (dimorphism).

25|$|In angiosperms, during flower {{development}} the <b>anther</b> {{is composed}} of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the <b>anther.</b> The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into {{the wall of the}} pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells.|$|E
40|$|In a fig–fig wasp symbiosis, we have {{discovered}} that male fig pollinators (Alfonsiella fimbriata Waterston) bite into the dehiscent <b>anthers</b> of Ficus natalensis leprieuri Miq., thus scattering the pollen grains throughout the syconium. Female pollinators {{are the only ones}} to transfer pollen to conspecific trees, and collect pollen actively from the <b>anthers</b> only. Thus, this male behaviour appears to be antagonistic to the pollination process. We compare different wasp pollinating behaviours between fig species exhibiting dehiscent and non-dehiscent <b>anthers</b> and conclude that this male behaviour is new and not required with spontaneously dehiscent <b>anthers.</b> These findings could suggest a host shift of Alfonsiella fimbriat...|$|R

50|$|The apostasioid orchids are {{the most}} {{primitive}} orchids, with only two genera. Neuwiedia has three fertile, abaxial (= facing away from the stem) <b>anthers,</b> while Apostasia has two fertile abaxial <b>anthers</b> and a filamentous staminode (= a sterile stamen). Plants with mealy or paste-like pollen, which ordinarily are not aggregated into pellets, called pollinia, {{with two or three}} fertile long <b>anthers,</b> leaves with sheathing bases, elongated staminode and labellum similar to the petals.|$|R
25|$|Cross Pollination or Xenogamy is {{the type}} of {{pollination}} in which pollen grains are transferred from <b>anther</b> to the stigma of a different plant.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the SI phenotype of {{the pollen}} {{is determined by}} the diploid genotype of the <b>anther.</b> In Brassica, the pollen coat, derived from the anther's tapetum tissue, carries the translation products of the two S alleles. These are small, cysteine-rich proteins. The male determinant is termed SCR or SP11, and is expressed in the <b>anther</b> tapetum {{as well as in the}} microspore and pollen (i.e. sporophytically). There are possibly up to 100 polymorphs of the S-haplotype in Brassica, and within these there is a dominance hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{typically}} red, orange, or yellow or {{any combination of}} those colours, and are aggregated in inflorescences that are spikes or panicles (thyrses). Although gardeners enjoy these odd flowers, nature really intended them to attract pollinators collecting nectar and pollen, such as bees, hummingbirds, sunbirds, and bats. The pollination mechanism is conspicuously specialized. Pollen is shed on the style while still in the bud, and in the species and early hybrids some is also found on the stigma {{because of the high}} position of the <b>anther,</b> which means that they are self-pollinating. Later cultivars have a lower <b>anther,</b> and rely on pollinators alighting on the labellum and touching first the terminal stigma, and then the pollen.|$|E

50|$|Herkogamy is {{a common}} {{strategy}} employed by hermaphroditic angiosperms to reduce sexual interference between male (<b>anthers)</b> and female (stigma) function. Herkogamy differs from other such strategies (e.g. dichogamy) by supplying a spatial separation of the <b>anthers</b> and stigma.|$|R

25|$|The {{flower of}} {{flowering}} plants is {{sometimes referred to}} as a bisexual strobilus. Stamens include microsporangia within the <b>anther,</b> and ovules (contained in carpels) contain megasporangia. Magnolia has a particularly strobiloid flower with all parts arranged in a spiral, rather than as clear whorls.|$|E
25|$|More commonly, {{the process}} of {{pollination}} requires pollinators: organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the <b>anther</b> of one flower to the receptive part of the carpel or pistil (stigma) of another. This is biotic pollination. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes.|$|E
25|$|In haploids {{produced}} from <b>anther</b> culture, {{it is observed}} that some plants are aneuploids and some are mixed haploid-diploid types. Another disadvantage associated with the double haploidy is the cost involved in establishing tissue culture and growth facilities. The over-usage of doubled haploidy may reduce genetic variation in breeding germplasm. Hence one has to take several factors into consideration before deploying doubled haploidy in breeding programmes.|$|E
5000|$|Stamens: Sixteen, {{inserted}} on the corolla, in staminate flowers in two rows.

25|$|In sporophytic {{self-incompatibility}} (SSI), the SI phenotype of {{the pollen}} {{is determined by}} the diploid genotype of the <b>anther</b> (the sporophyte) in which it was created. This form of SI was identified in the families: Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Convolvulaceae, Betulaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Sterculiaceae and Polemoniaceae. Up to this day, only one mechanism of SSI has been described in detail at the molecular level, in Brassica (Brassicaceae).|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of the haploid plant was {{published}} by Blakeslee et al. (1922) in Datura stramonium. Subsequently, haploids were reported in many other species. Guha and Maheshwari (1964) developed an <b>anther</b> culture technique {{for the production of}} haploids in the laboratory. Haploid production by wide crossing was reported in barley (Kasha and Kao, 1970) and tobacco (Burk et al., 1979). Tobacco, rapeseed, and barley are the most responsive species for doubled haploid production. Doubled haploid methodologies have now been applied to over 250 species.|$|E
25|$|Doubled haploids can be {{produced}} in vivo or in vitro. Haploid embryos are produced in vivo by parthenogenesis, pseudogamy, or chromosome elimination after wide crossing. The haploid embryo is rescued, cultured, and chromosome-doubling produces doubled haploids. The in vitro methods include gynogenesis (ovary and flower culture) and androgenesis (<b>anther</b> and microspore culture). Androgenesis is the preferred method. Another method of producing the haploids is wide crossing. In barley, haploids can {{be produced}} by wide crossing with the related species Hordeum bulbosum; fertilization is affected, but {{during the early stages}} of seed development the H. bulbosum chromosomes are eliminated leaving a haploid embryo. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), wide crossing with Nicotiana africana is widely used. When N. africana is used to pollinate N. tabacum, 0.25 to 1.42 percent of the progeny survive and can readily be identified as either F1 hybrids or maternal haploids. Although these percentages appear small, the vast yield of tiny seeds and the early death of most seedlings provide significant numbers of viable hybrids and haploids in relatively small soil containers. This method of interspecific pollination serves as a practical way of producing seed-derived haploids of N. tabacum, either as an alternative method or complementary method to <b>anther</b> culture.|$|E
