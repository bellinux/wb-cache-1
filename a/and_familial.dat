For instance, the European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis <b>and</b> <b>Familial</b> Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) trial is aiming {{to determine whether}} regular screening is appropriate for people with {{a family history of}} the disease, or who have hereditary pancreatitis. The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience <b>and</b> <b>familial</b> love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the health needs, <b>familial</b> <b>and</b> social problems of Thai migrants {{in a local}} community in Brisbane, Australia. Five focus groups with Thai migrants were conducted. The qualitative data were examined using thematic content analysis that is specifically designed for focus group analysis. Four themes were identified: (1) positive experiences in Australia, (2) physical health problems, (3) mental health problems, <b>and</b> (4) <b>familial</b> <b>and</b> social health problems. This study revealed key health needs related to chronic disease and mental health, major barriers to health service use, such as language skills, and facilitating factors, such as the Thai Temple. We concluded that because the health needs, <b>familial</b> <b>and</b> social problems of Thai migrants were complex and culture bound, the development of health and community services for Thai migrants needs {{to take account of}} the ways in which Thai culture both negatively impacts health and offer positive solutions to problems. ...|$|R

The Norman invasion of Ireland, subsequent to the Norman conquest of England, added political ties between Ireland and England, including a common English language.|$|E
25|$|During {{early stages}} of production, Naomi was largely {{described}} as a privileged and popular teenager.

In the second season, Sinclair, the new show-runner, maintained the previous developments but presented a more comedic take on the character. McCord has expressed fondness for the multi-faceted nature of the role, citing it as a factor in her decision to accept the part.|$|E

These four factors will help distinguish Black women from Black males into an accurate branch of learning in the criminal justice system.|$|E

Gummow J took the narrowest interpretation, holding that there was not a right to freedom of movement <b>and</b> <b>familial</b> association, and even if such rights existed, the 1918 Ordinance did not infringe them.|$|E
25|$|The Mediterranean diet {{forms the}} basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and {{vegetables}} and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly {{on the quality of the}} ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local <b>and</b> <b>familial</b> tradition rather than created by chefs, so many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this being one of the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America to Asia.

25|$|Predictor {{models have}} {{consistently}} found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, <b>and</b> <b>familial</b> stressors increase risk for PTSD {{as well as}} risk for biological markers of risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. Experiencing bullying as a child or an adult has been correlated {{with the development of}} PTSD. Peritraumatic dissociation in children is a predictive indicator of the development of PTSD later in life. This effect of childhood trauma, which is not well understood, may be a marker for both traumatic experiences and attachment problems. Proximity to, duration of, and severity of the trauma make an impact, and interpersonal traumas cause more problems than impersonal ones.|$|E
25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past.

25|$|The fall of Baghdad saw the {{outbreak}} of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of Al-Kut and Nasiriyah launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain {{the capital of the}} new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, <b>and</b> <b>familial</b> groups continued.|$|E
25|$|The reigns of John II Casimir Vasa, Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki and John III Sobieski brought further {{downgrading}} {{and loss}} of effectiveness of governmental authority, both {{in the domain of}} royal control and in the areas of legislative (central and local) ability to function and power. With the diminished fortunes of regular szlachta, the struggle for power and the rather feeble, bit still present attempts to reform the system took place within the changing alliances of powerful magnates and royal courts. From the time of John Casimir and his wife Marie Louise, who cared about the well-being of the Commonwealth, but were obsessively preoccupied with the issue of royal succession, the Polish–Lithuanian state was informally divided into a number of territorial domains, practically controlled by regional top feudal lords, inclined to pursue their private <b>and</b> <b>familial</b> interests in the first place.|$|E
