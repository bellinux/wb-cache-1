25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} market rates were fixed, but were allowed adjustments when necessary and currencies {{were required to}} be convertible. For this purpose, <b>all</b> <b>currencies</b> had to be backed by either physical gold reserves, or a currency convertible into gold. The United States dollar was recognized as the world's reserve currency, as the anchor currency of the system. The price of one troy ounce of gold was pegged to US$35.|$|E
500|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity (CIRP) {{is found to}} hold when there is open capital mobility and limited capital controls, and this finding is confirmed for <b>all</b> <b>currencies</b> freely traded in the present day. One such example is when the United Kingdom and Germany abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981. Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by {{the expression of a}} potential inequality in the CIRP equation (meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets) during the 1960s and 1970s, which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls. However, given financial liberalization and resulting capital mobility, arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored. Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany, potential arbitrage profits have been near zero. Factoring in transaction costs arising from fees and other regulations, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity. While CIRP generally holds, it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs, political risks, tax implications for interest earnings versus gains from foreign exchange, and differences in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets.|$|E

The U.S. currency was now effectively the world currency, the standard to which every other currency was pegged.
