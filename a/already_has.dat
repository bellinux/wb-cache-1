5|$|Because SI prefixes {{may not be}} {{concatenated}} (serially linked) {{within the}} name or symbol for a unit of measure, SI prefixes are used with the gram, not the kilogram, which <b>already</b> <b>has</b> a prefix {{as part of its}} name. For instance, one-millionth of a kilogram is 1mg (one milligram), not 1µkg (one microkilogram).|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270mg per day {{estimated}} an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH <b>already</b> <b>has</b> occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within {{three months after the}} ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).|$|E

25|$|As {{this formula}} only applies when {{the gap between}} the ratings of the two teams {{at the start of the}} series was less than 40 points, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they <b>already</b> <b>had,</b> and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating they <b>already</b> <b>had.</b> Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more rating points than the rating they <b>already</b> <b>had,</b> and the {{stronger}} team fewer.|$|R
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of components for chemical weapons {{were removed from}} Syria by a Norwegian/Danish flotilla on 7 January 2014. The 31 December deadline for complete removal of priority chemicals had been missed; on 7 January, the New York Times assessed the delay {{was due to the}} difficulty of overland transport of chemical weapons {{in the middle of a}} civil war. A second shipment was removed around 27 January; that same day, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed that Syria <b>already</b> <b>has</b> the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{dated to}} {{the first half of}} the 4th century and is likely slightly older than Codex Sinaiticus, which was also transcribed in the 4th century. One argument to support this, is that Sinaiticus <b>already</b> <b>has</b> the, at that time, very new Eusebian Canon tables, but Vaticanus does not. Another is the slightly more archaic style of Vaticanus, and the complete absence of ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} of doing his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he <b>already</b> <b>has</b> someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.|$|E

5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} essential element of Pokémon gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon (other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured), the player may use a Poké Ball on the wild Pokémon. If successful, the Pokémon {{will be added to}} the player's active party (or stored if the player <b>already</b> <b>has</b> the maximum six Pokémon in his/her party). Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP (and/or status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep,) of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.|$|E
5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player <b>already</b> <b>has</b> the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E
5|$|As {{the pair}} leave separately, Mařenka's parents, Ludmila and Krušina, enter with the {{marriage}} broker Kecal. After some discussion, Kecal announces {{that he has}} found a groom for Mařenka – Vašek, younger son of Tobiáš Mícha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing. Kecal extols the virtues of Vašek ("He's a nice boy, well brought up"), as Mařenka re-enters. In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that she <b>already</b> <b>has</b> a chosen lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four argue, but little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jeník to give up Mařenka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.|$|E

Another attendee named Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt) converses with Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), who is still somewhat depressed over his breakup with his fiancée Stacy and walks away when he admits it was she who broke it off. Kevin returns later to apologize to Lynne and admits he gets nervous talking to pretty girls; Lynne is flattered and gives Kevin her e-mail address. Afterwards, Michael is disappointed the woman who lost her glove does not show up and tells the employees they can go home early, but the empathetic staff decide to stay and later encourage Michael to leave with them.|$|E
5|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-,...) are often required to indicate the relative compositions, and cations then anions are listed in alphabetical order. For example, KMgCl3 is named magnesium potassium trichloride to distinguish it from K2MgCl4, magnesium dipotassium tetrachlorideMgCl4 and Cs2MgCl4|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=January 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=114–118|doi=10.1139/v75-015}} (note that in both the empirical formula and the written name, the cations appear in alphabetical order, but the order varies between them because the symbol for potassium is K). When one of the ions <b>already</b> <b>has</b> a multiplicative prefix within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (bis-, tris-, tetrakis-,...) are used. For example, Ba(BrF4)2 is named barium bis(tetrafluoridobromate).|$|E

Willow tries to restore Raziel, but turns her into a rook instead. Madmartigan is dosed with love dust by the brownies and declares his undying love for Sorsha. The prisoners escape and reach a village {{at the foot of a}} mountain, where they again encounter Airk and the remains of his army, recently defeated by Bavmorda's forces.

5|$|Six {{months after}} Sam sold {{the bar to}} a corporation, the place caters to a more {{up-market}} clientele. Eddie Lebec turns up and is surprised when Carla Tortelli tells him she is pregnant (incorporated by actress Rhea Perlman's real-life pregnancy). Sam Malone then returns to the bar after his attempt to sail around the world failed at the first hurdle when his sailboat ran ashore in the Caribbean. Though Cheers has new management, Woody Boyd and Carla are still employed at the bar, but they're now required to wear uniforms, much to their chagrin. Sam then also needs a job, but the bar <b>already</b> <b>has</b> two bartenders, Woody and a new employee, Wayne. Diane Chambers' attempts at writing her novel {{are said to have}} failed, which led to her leaving Boston to write in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 <b>already</b> <b>has</b> over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.|$|E
