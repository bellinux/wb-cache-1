5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter {{to check on}} the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater.

5|$|Major {{repair work}} was done in 2003 and 2006, when the Victorian {{drainage}} culvert was replaced and the track lowered to allow access for larger passenger and freight stock {{at a cost of}} £10million.

5|$|Most ships {{had their}} director-control tower and {{rangefinder}} above the bridge removed {{in exchange for}} a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aimed by turning the entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast.|$|E
