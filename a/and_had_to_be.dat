B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater.

A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aimed by turning the entire ship.
