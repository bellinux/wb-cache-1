5|$|The {{recovery}} of European wolf populations began after the 1950s, when traditional pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed {{the need to}} heavily persecute wolves.

5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting <b>areas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the six-lane {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1977, initially as the Zagreb bypass, then {{continued in the}} 1980s as {{an expansion of the}} existing two-lane road between Zagreb and Belgrade. The construction was suspended {{in the first part of}} the 1990s, due to the Croatian War of Independence, and resumed in 1996. Construction of the entire route was completed in 2006; further development entails new exits, new rest <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction of the existing motorway. The construction cost of the A3 motorway is estimated at 7 billionCroatian kuna (approximately 958.9 millioneuro).|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to ignite, large quantities were required to cover even modest <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to ignite oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the IUCN {{listed the}} Asian {{elephant}} as endangered {{due to a}} 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years while CITES lists the species under Appendix I. Asian elephants once ranged from Syria and Iraq (the subspecies Elephas maximus asurus), to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. It is now extinct in these <b>areas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian elephants {{is estimated to be}} around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. It is likely that around half of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats appears to be increasing.|$|E

5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation <b>areas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E

5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal <b>areas</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third {{of the price of}} their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the life history of hawksbills. Their life history can be divided into three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from {{hatching}} to about 20cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging <b>areas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reproductive phase, when they reach sexual maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20cm in length in 1–3 years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40cm (2–4 years).|$|E
5|$|On 8 October, Croatia {{declared}} {{independence from}} Yugoslavia, {{and a month}} later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV). The fiercest fighting of the war occurred around this time, when the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In November, Croatia, Serbia and the JNA agreed upon the Vance plan entailing a ceasefire, protection of civilians in specific areas designated as United Nations Protected <b>Areas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presence of UN peacekeepers in Croatia.

5|$|Recent {{governments have}} {{encouraged}} {{the formation of}} town and parish councils in unparished <b>areas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Local Government and Rating Act 1997 gave local residents the right to demand {{the creation of a}} new civil parish. A parish council can become a town council unilaterally, simply by resolution; and a civil parish can also gain city status, but only if that is granted by the Crown. The chairman of a town or city council is called a mayor. There are currently 28 civil parishes in the county with the status of a town, and one (Wells) with city status. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 introduced alternative names: a parish council can now chose to be called a community; village; or neighbourhood council.|$|E
