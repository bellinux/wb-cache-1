25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to August 1918, US customs {{officials}} at Nogales killed at least two individuals who were attempting to enter the US along the vaguely defined border. On the afternoon of 31 December 1917 Francisco Mercado, an off-duty Mexican customs agent, attempted to cross into Nogales, Arizona, despite calls from a US Army sentry who asked him, in English, to stop. Before various eyewitnesses, the soldier shot and killed Mercado. The killing of Gerardo Pesqueira, the deaf-mute son of former Sonoran governor Ignacio Pesqueira , further angered the people of Nogales, Sonora. US sentries ordered the unarmed man to halt as he approached the border. Unable to hear the order, Pesqueira continued walking, whereupon the guards opened fire, killing him. Pesqueira “was known for his caring and cheerful nature. Historian Parra, citing US General DeRosey Cabell's August 1918 military investigation on the incident, highlights that this--along with the crude attitude shown by US customs agents towards ordinary Mexican border crossers during day-to-day transiting of the border--created <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> resentment of US guards by Mexican border agents. The seeming impunity of US border guards was becoming increasingly intolerable to nogalenses, a point made by General Cabell and U.S. Consul in Nogales, Sonora, E.M. Lawton and Vice-consul W.A. Maguire. However, in a brief passage from his 1921 book History of the Tenth Cavalry, 1866-1921 Edward Glass indicates that changes in Mexican officials and soldier attitudes helped contribute to the tense situation.|$|E

The team found both total and bioavailable lead to be markedly higher in areas close to major highways, almost 20 years after leaded gasoline had been completely phased out. Multi-regression and cluster analyses reveal the association of elevated levels of total and bioavailable lead with proximity to major highways that cut through Pacoima. Moreover, bioavailability ratios are higher next to highways than elsewhere. What this reveals is an unexpected persistence of lead deposited by vehicular emissions {{over a long period of}} time, a potentially intractable policy issue. The long residence time of soil lead represents an enduring public health problem, especially considering the numbers of those potentially exposed over time. It is unclear how expedient or realistic the conversion of land use around major highways might be, or how this new information might be integrated into ongoing movements for change. However, some policy actions can, even now, be considered—e. g. a closer policy focus on the bioavailable, not just total, fraction of soil lead.

2500|$|Papen {{stayed in}} the Zentrum mostly because he hoped to move his party towards the right, and he often {{advocated}} that the Zentrum leave the Weimar Coalition to join a coalition with the German National People's Party. In {{the words of the}} British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett who lived in Berlin between 1927–34 and knew the [...] "gentleman rider" [...] well, Papen was a [...] "fervent Catholic" [...] who always carried his rosary with him, and was a man of [...] "considerable wealth" [...] as his father-in-law was the richest industrialist in the Saarland. Papen exercised a certain degree of power in the Zentrum by the virtue of being the largest shareholder in the Catholic newspaper Germania, which was the most prestigious of the Catholic papers in Germany. Papen's beliefs were based on a type of Catholic conservatism that believed that sovereignty rested only with God and those He had appointed as His earthly representatives such as the Catholic Church and the aristocracy, which led Papen to a complete rejection of democracy as he felt that sovereignty could not rest with the people. Papen viewed the November Revolution of 1918 as a disaster that had brought [...] "western subjectivism" [...] to Germany, tearing apart the natural order of things and Germany could not recover from this disaster until the democratic system was destroyed.

For Papen, like many Catholic noblemen, the authors of these disastrous developments were the Freemasons and the Jews. For Papen, the present was culmination of all he hated as he saw various developments like Marxism, women's rights, individualism, [...] "economic egoism", democracy and the [...] "de-Christianization" [...] of German culture as part and parcel of the same conspiracy that had allegedly begun in 18th century France.|$|E

While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary".

Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E

"May {{it not be}} possible," [...] asked Septimius, [...] "to {{have too}} <b>profound</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the marvellous {{contrivance}} and adaptation of this material world to require or believe in anything spiritual? How wonderful it is {{to see it all}} alive on this spring day, all growing, budding! Do we exhaust it in our little life? Not so; not in a hundred or a thousand lives. The whole race of man, living from the beginning of time, have not, in all their number and multiplicity and in all their duration, come in the least to know the world they live in! And how is this rich world thrown away upon us, because we live in it such a moment! What mortal work has ever been done since the world began! Because we have no time. No lesson is taught. We are snatched away from our study before we have learned the alphabet. As the world now exists, I confess it to you frankly, my dear pastor and instructor, it seems to me all a failure, because we do not live long enough." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There are a {{small group}} of mature adults in their 50 s and 60 s, members of the {{so-called}} third age that arrive at the door for psychotherapy. As clients, they want to explore an overwhelming <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> being dis-located in space and time, and at odds with where they find themselves living. They have <b>a</b> deep and <b>profound</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> not belonging and of being rootless. These older, white, adults are the baby-boomers of post World War II, and I refer to them as the adult children of the colonies because they are of European descent but born in the colonies of Africa. This paper describes the experiences of two clients, Robert and Caitlin, who find themselves feeling progressively psychically dis-located in South Africa and confronting not only their limited future in terms of impending death, but confronting existential givens of life that prevent them at this late stage of life from returning home to their ancestral lands. They present a unique group of older adult clients, and like fish out of water, they have no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging to Africa, and as a result, they experience a range of emotions such as despair and depression with a concomitant <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fragmented identities. Discussion of the cases ensues and includes the concept of intergenerational transmission of trauma, fragmented identities, and belonging as linked to ancestral lands...|$|R
60|$|Although {{the stern}} {{discipline}} which separates {{the cabin and}} steerage passengers into castes as distinct {{as those of the}} Hindoos had not yet been established, Captain Truck had too <b>profound</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> his duty to permit the quarterdeck to be unceremoniously invaded. This part of the ship, then, had partially escaped the confusion of the moment; though trunks, boxes, hampers, and other similar appliances of travelling, were scattered about in tolerable affluence. Profiting by the space, of which there was still sufficient for the purpose, most of the party left the hurricane-house to enjoy the short walk that a ship affords. At that instant, another boat from the land reached the vessel's side, and a grave-looking personage, who was not disposed to lessen his dignity by levity or an omission of forms, appeared on deck, where he demanded to be shown the master. An introduction was unnecessary in this instance; for Captain Truck no sooner saw his visitor than he recognized the well-known features and solemn pomposity of a civil officer of Portsmouth, who was often employed to search the American packets, in pursuit of delinquents of all degrees of crime and folly.|$|R
