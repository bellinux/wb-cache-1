5|$|M-theory is {{a theory}} in physics that unifies all {{consistent}} versions of superstring theory. The existence of such a theory was first conjectured by Edward Witten at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California {{in the spring of}} 1995. Witten's announcement initiated <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of research activity known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{second round}} {{began with the}} two fighters exchanging <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of strikes. Silva then {{attempted}} a takedown {{with a combination of}} a body lock and a trip, but Jackson reversed it into a takedown of his own. The action stayed in Silva's guard very briefly, until the two scrambled back to their feet.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E

5|$|In 1777, Henry Hamilton, a British Lieutenant Governor of Canada, {{began to}} recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. On April 24, Shawnee Indians led by Chief Blackfish {{attacked}} Boonesborough. Boone {{was shot in}} the ankle while outside the fort, but he was carried back inside amid <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of bullets by Simon Kenton, a recent arrival at Boonesborough. Kenton became Boone's close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right.|$|E
5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), {{was written by}} Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E

6000|$|... "Was it you {{who called}} and asked all them questions? My! We couldn't make out who it was. The man said it was <b>a</b> <b>flurried</b> young gentleman who wouldn't leave a card,--but who wanted to see Mr. Boncassen most especial." ...|$|R
60|$|To rid myself, {{as far as}} possible, of {{one piece}} of duplicity, I at once took the bull by the horns, and in the {{presence}} of Mrs Bowater boldly invited him to stay to tea. With <b>a</b> <b>flurried</b> glance of the eye in her direction he accepted my invitation.|$|R
5|$|Popular {{demand for}} Greek New Testaments led to <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of further {{authorized}} and unauthorized editions {{in the early}} sixteenth century; almost {{all of which were}} based on Erasmus's work and incorporated his particular readings, although typically also making a number of minor changes of their own. Tregelles gives Acts 13:33 {{as an example of the}} places in which commonly received text did not follow Erasmian text (εν τω ψαλμω τω πρωτω → εν τω ψαλμω τω δευτερω).|$|E
5|$|The Petition caused <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of {{broadside}} satires, {{poems and}} ballads {{on the subject}} through the following year. The historian James Turner identifies this event {{as an example of}} a new carnivalisation of sexuality in Restoration England, where genuine political attack, satire, street commentary and bawdy theatre came together. Two years after the riots, a mob gathered once more and again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though protection from the local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Gaius in AD4 {{initiated}} <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> {{of activity in}} the household of Augustus. Tiberius was adopted as full son and heir and in turn, he was required to adopt his nephew, Germanicus, the son of his brother Drusus and Augustus' niece Antonia Minor. Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power {{as well as a}} share of Augustus's maius imperium, something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had.|$|E
5000|$|Brujon - A robber and criminal. He {{participates in}} crimes with M. Thénardier and the Patron-Minette gang (such as the Gorbeau Robbery and the {{attempted}} robbery at the Rue Plumet). The author describes Brujon as being [...] "a sprightly young fellow, very cunning and very adroit, with <b>a</b> <b>flurried</b> and plaintive appearance." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes, at eleven,' exclaims Goldmore, perturbedly, {{and walks}} with <b>a</b> <b>flurried</b> {{step into the}} house, {{as if he were}} going to {{execution}} (as indeed he was, with that wicked Gray as a Jack Ketch over him). The carriage drove away, followed by numberless eyes from doorsteps and balconies; its appearance is still a wonder in Bittlestone Street.|$|R
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. <b>A</b> <b>flurry</b> of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of diplomatic activity to form a new coalition against France. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|One {{response}} to this popularity was in commissioning the construction of replica castles. These were particularly popular at beginning of the 19th century, and again later in the Victorian period. Design manuals were published offering details of how to recreate the appearance of an original Gothic castles in a new build, leading to <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of work, such as Eastnor in 1815, the fake Norman castle of Penrhyn between 1827 and 1837 and the imitation Edwardian castle of Goodrich Court in 1828. The later Victorians built the Welsh Castell Coch in the 1880s as a fantasy Gothic construction and the last such replica, Castle Drogo, was built as late as 1911.|$|E
60|$|They were {{interrupted}} by a sudden knock at the door--not the discreet tap of a well-bred domestic, but <b>a</b> <b>flurried,</b> almost <b>an</b> imperative summons. Before either of them could reply, the door was opened and Brookes, the elderly butler, presented himself upon the threshold. Even before he spoke, {{it was clear that}} he brought alarming news.|$|R

5|$|The final trigger, however, was the {{discovery}} of gold elsewhere in Canada and Alaska, prompting a new stampede, this {{time away from the}} Klondike. In August 1898, gold had been found at Atlin Lake {{at the head of the}} Yukon River, generating <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of interest, but during the winter of 1898–99 much larger quantities were found at Nome at the mouth of the Yukon. In 1899, a flood of prospectors from across the region left for Nome, 8,000 from Dawson alone during a single week in August. The Klondike gold rush was over.|$|E
5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|The second fight {{began with}} Jackson moving forward {{and getting into}} a clinch early. The two {{exchanged}} strikes in this position before breaking up. Jackson followed by throwing a brief flurry of punches and landing a knee. About halfway into the first round, Silva threw <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of punches and landed several knees from the Muay Thai Clinch before pushing Jackson against the turnbuckle. Jackson scrambled out of the clinch and scored a takedown {{with a combination of}} a leg trip and a headlock. Jackson attacked with ground and pound, but to limited damage, while Silva attempted submissions unsuccessfully. The referee then stood the fighters up due to inactivity.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} pushing and {{scraping}} of chairs. Arthur rose, tense, terrified. <b>A</b> little <b>flurry</b> of voices followed.|$|R

25|$|On March 28, 2015, Donaire {{returned}} to Super Bantamweight division and defeated William Prado in two rounds {{to secure the}} vacant NABF super bantamweight title at the Araneta Coliseum in the Philippines. <b>A</b> <b>flurried</b> attack had Prado dazed {{at the end of}} the first round. Donaire continued his attack at the beginning of the second round and the fight was stopped. On July 18, 2015, Donaire also defeated Anthony Settoul in two rounds again via stoppage at The Venetian Macao in Macau, China.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip engaged in <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, {{son of the}} Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts {{in exchange for their}} withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E
5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} bayou, and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to dismantle the grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make {{their way out of}} the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to <b>a</b> <b>flurry</b> of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
