Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Belt drive mechanisms are alternatives to robotic actuators to obtain complex repetitive motions by simple actuation. By simply changing the dimensions of the mechanism, we can obtain different kinds of trajectories for the exit link of the mechanism. Of course the trajectory of the exit link is not smooth due to the flexibility of the belt. Hence when designing such mechanisms it is imperative to find the corrections to the base trajectory of the exit link due to the elasticity of the belt. This is the aim of the present work. In order to do this, we adopt an approximate analysis technique. First, the forces that are applied to the belt are found by neglecting the elasticity of the belt. Then we use those forces to obtain the deformation of the belt. Rather than treating the belt as infinite degrees of freedom system, we simplify the analysis further by a nonlinear extension of the method of assumed modes. Then, we assume that the deflected shape of the belt is triangular, so that the belt has only two degrees of freedom. Two coupled equations of motion for the deflections of the belt are obtained by employing the method of Lagrangian mechanics. The deflection variations with time are obtained by using the standard numerical solution procedure in Maple for the different values of the belt stiffness, mass density for different <b>actuation</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R

While the current state-of-the-art pumps {{are capable of}} high efficiency at maximum displacement, reducing the displacement results in significant reductions in efficiency. Work done previously with digital displacement strategies using electrically-controlled valves demonstrated an option to improve these characteristics of traditional pumping methods. However, the complex and costly valve controls needed to implement the system prove impractical in some situations. ^ Additionally, the electrical valves used in this system have limited speed, consistency, and flow area. It was determined that a mechanically-actuated valve (MAV) system could be implemented to reduce the control complexity and cost while maintaining most {{of the benefits of}} digital displacement. The mechanical system consists of variable geometry cams to actuate the valves, allowing for greater consistency in <b>actuation,</b> proportional <b>speed</b> of <b>actuation</b> to pump <b>speed,</b> and larger valve flow areas. This system can achieve variable displacement digital hydraulic pumping with no electrical input or required sensors. ^ The MAV concept was theoretically investigated, validated in simulation, and proven in the building and testing of a simple prototype unit. The MAV pump performed comparably to the previous prototype at full displacement and achieved a 10 % higher efficiency at 50 % displacement. Though this prototype was limited to flow-diverting pumping, this technology could be expanded to achieve four-quadrant operation. Considering the successful prototype testing and theoretical potential of this concept, further investigation is necessary to fully determine the capabilities of the MAV system. ...|$|R

40|$|Most valves {{available}} in the fluid power industry today are capable of achieving either a large flow rate or a quick response time; however, often {{they are unable to}} deliver both simultaneously. Commercially available valves that can produce {{both at the same time}} require complex geometries with multiple actuation stages and piloting pressures, making them expensive components. To establish their active usage in applications across the fluid power industry, a reduction in price for these components is paramount. The Energy Coupling Actuated Valve (ECAV) is capable of solving the large flow rates with fast <b>actuation</b> <b>speeds</b> trade-off by utilizing a new, high performance actuation system. The Energy Coupling Actuator (ECA) is an innovative actuation system that separates the kinetic energy source mass from the actuation mass. Intermittently coupling the actuator to a constantly rotating disk creates an energy transfer from the rotating disk’s kinetic energy to the normally stationary actuator. This intermittent coupling process is controlled by changing the magnetic field inside the actuator’s two coils. Magnetorheological (MR) fluid resides in a 0. 5 mm fluid gap between the spinning disk and the actuator, and when the magnetic flux builds across this gap, it causes the actuator to move rapidly in a translational movement. The MR fluid changes to a solid between the gap and frictionally binds the actuator to the disk, causing the actuator to move up or down, depending on which coil is actuated on the spinning disk. The liquid-solid conversion from the MR fluid occurs in less than one millisecond and is completely reversible. The shear strength of the fluid is proportional to the magnetic field strength inside the system. The actuator is connected to either a poppet or spool assembly for valve actuation, and the position is controlled through intermittently binding the actuator to the disk. ^ Two valve prototypes, one poppet and one spool type, were machined, and concept validation has been done in both simulation and experimentally. Experimental results show that the poppet reaches a 4 mm displacement in 19. 8 ms opening and 17 ms in closing under 33 L/min flow. The spool valve experimentally transitioned in 4. 8 ms at the same flow rate. ...|$|R

The rapid expansion of the set of materials available to MEMS designers motivates the need for a systematic and rational approach toward the selection of materials for electrostatic actuators.

Conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole, exhibit muscle-like properties and the potential to provide the above capabilities while delivering significant forces over useful displacements. Current conducting polymer linear actuators, however, are generally limited to displacements of less than 0. 5 mm, forces of less than 1 N, and cycle frequencies of less than 0. 1 Hz. These materials are rarely tested on a length scale of more than a few millimeters, and their incorporation into real applications has to date been limited. This work focuses on improving and scaling conducting polymer linear actuators for application in macroscale systems. A new fabrication method is described that delivers polypyrrole ribbons with uniform thicknesses of 10 to 30 [mu]m, widths of 20 [mu]m to 20 mm, and lengths exceeding 5 m. A second method is described where a conductive gold layer is incorporated into the ribbons and is shown to enhance performance and mitigate limiting effects common to longer conducting polymer actuators. Additionally, parallel actuation is explored as a method to achieve greater forces without compromising <b>actuation</b> <b>speed.</b> The integration of these actuators into stand alone systems that include joints and flexures has yielded novel techniques in amplifying motion while minimizing friction, improving electrical connection, and increasing actuator lifetime. The challenges of incorporating these actuators into an example biomimetic system are discussed and an approach is introduced.

50|$|In {{traditional}} sprung-valve <b>actuation,</b> as engine <b>speed</b> increases, {{the momentum}} of the valve will eventually overcome the spring's ability to close it completely before the piston reaches TDC (top dead centre). This can lead to several problems. First, and most damaging, the piston collides with the valve and both are destroyed. Second, the valve does not completely return to its seat before combustion begins. This allows combustion gases to escape prematurely, leading to a reduction in cylinder pressure which causes a major decrease in engine performance. This can also overheat the valve, possibly warping it and leading to catastrophic failure. In sprung-valve engines the traditional remedy for valve float is to stiffen the springs. This increases the seat pressure of the valve (the static pressure that holds the valve closed). This is beneficial at higher engine speeds because of a reduction in the aforementioned valve float. The drawback is that the engine has to work harder to open the valve at all engine speeds. The higher spring pressure causes greater friction (hence temperature and wear) in the valvetrain.|$|R

Several types of microvalves that can be integrated into a microfluidic chip have been reported. Among them, gel microvalves have certain advantages over other valves because of their soft structure, which will contribute to prevent mechanical damage the cells passing though the valve.

Since Bioresist is photopatternable, we can create any arbitrary 2 D shape from the thermoresponsive gel using photolithography. Moreover, Bioresist has the unique feature of a phase transition around 30 °C, and swells and shrinks repeatedly with temperature change.

This has several advantages, the most relevant being {{that it does not}} depend on an hydrodynamic instability to onset the flow motion. Laser heating creates large localized thermal gradients that make the flow velocity fast and localized. Simulations show that flow velocities up to 8. 5 mm/s can be obtained using as little power as 38 mW with a temperature increase as little as 4 °C. As a proof of concept, steel spherical particles of 500 μ m diameter are successfully displaced using this principle, which attain a mean maximal speed up to 4 mm/s.
