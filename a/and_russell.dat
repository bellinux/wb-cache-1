5|$|The {{original}} Q11 route served both Old Howard Beach and Hamilton Beach as {{a single}} branch.

5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E

5|$|Thompson <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> {{found another}} {{evolutionary}} lineage that originates in a glacially restricted {{area of the}} Salmon River Mountains, Idaho. With {{the arrival of the}} Holocene interglacial, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Pleistocene glaciers receded and opened a migratory path linking these southern populations to northern areas where they currently overlap with A. m. krausei and co-migrated north into the Peace River (Canada) Valley. Ferguson also noted an intergradation in the same geographic area, but between the morphological subspecies A. m. columbianum and A. m. kraisei that run parallel to the Bitterroot and Selkirk ranges. Thompson <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> suggest that this contact zone is between two different subspecies lineages because the A. m. columbianum lineage is geographically isolated and restricted to the central Oregon Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Averaging a triple-double in {{a single}} season: Oscar Robertson (Cincinnati Royals) <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) are the only players in NBA history to achieve this feat. During the 1961–62 season, Robertson {{averaged}} 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 11.4 assists per game. Although Robertson only achieved the feat for a full season once, his cumulative stats over his first 5 seasons gave him an average of 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists per game. Westbrook finished the 2016–17 season averaging 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 10.4 assists.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{uncertainty}} at quarterback, Michigan {{entered the}} 1997 {{season with a}} solid group of receivers, including Tai Streets <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> Shaw, as well as returning All-Big Ten tight end Jerame Tuman.

5|$|During the 1892 presidential campaign, {{there was}} talk of Russell being the Vice Presidential nominee if Senator John M. Palmer were to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination.

Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. Russell received one vote for President on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|In Brest, {{command of}} Marseillois passed to Captain Henri-César de Castellane Majastre, {{and she became}} part of a {{squadron}} under Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse. A young Pierre-Charles Villeneuve served aboard as an ensign. On 22 March 1781, the fleet sailed for America to reinforce D'Estaing's forces there, arriving off Martinique on 29 April. There, the fleet met the British forces under Admiral Hood, and the Battle of Fort Royal broke out, an inconclusive long-ranged artillery duel that lasted until the British retreated the next day due to the damage sustained by HMS Intrepid, Centaur <b>and</b> <b>Russell.</b>|$|E

5|$|Late in 1910, the BX {{fulfilled}} {{a heroic}} role. The Chilco {{had been on}} its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to make one last run with the BX with the necessary supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without {{as much as a}} scratch on her paint.|$|E
5|$|Russell was a {{prominent}} businessman, well respected among his peers and the community. Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855 they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell. They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.|$|E
5|$|South of Mill Point Road to Roe Highway {{the freeway}} has three lanes in each direction, without any bus lanes except for bus-only ramps at the Canning Bridge interchange.

Works are currently underway to add an extra lane southbound between Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive, <b>and</b> <b>Russell</b> Road in Hammond Park. The median strip of the freeway north of The Spectacles also houses the Mandurah railway line. A shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside the freeway.|$|E
