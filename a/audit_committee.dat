5|$|Enron's <b>audit</b> <b>committee</b> {{was later}} criticized for its brief {{meetings}} that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's <b>audit</b> <b>committee</b> did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E

In 2002, the Kenya Capital Markets Authority required all listed companies to establish <b>audit</b> <b>committees.</b> This study examined: 1) the practices of <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> in Kenyan listed companies; 2) how <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> relate to other stakeholders; 3) the major achievements and challenges facing <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> in Kenya. A questionnaire survey completed by 29 companies (60 %) showed that <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> in Kenya are more independent than <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> of other developing countries of Africa. All the <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> reported cordial relationships with the management, internal audit and the external auditors, and were perceived to have improved the quality of financial reporting.

40|$|In Australia, {{while only}} the Top 500 firms {{listed on the}} Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) are {{required}} to form <b>audit</b> <b>committees,</b> many Non-Top 500 firms still voluntarily establish <b>audit</b> <b>committees.</b> Why these firms do so {{is the subject of}} this paper. Specifically, this study examines the association between firm specific characteristics and the voluntary formation of <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> by Non-Top 500 firms listed on the ASX. Several specific firm characteristics are expected to be associated with the voluntary formation of <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> by Non-Top 500 firms listed on the ASX. Based on a sample of 224 Non-Top 500 firms listed on the ASX, the results of this study find that firm size and board size are positively associated with the voluntary formation of <b>audit</b> <b>committees.</b> In addition, higher levels of leverage, an independent Chairman of the Board and a higher proportion of independent directors on the Board provide incentives for Non-Top 500 firms listed on the ASX to voluntarily form <b>audit</b> <b>committees.</b> 32 page(s...|$|R

In addition, we do not find evidence that incremental independence of <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> enhances financial reporting quality because <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> already consist of a majority of independent directors.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between firm characteristics and incentives for the voluntary formation of <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> by non-top 500 firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Design/methodology/approach – Data are obtained from a random sample of 224 non-top 500 firms listed on the ASX for the year 2005. Logistic regression analysis is used to examine the characteristics of non-top 500 firms who have voluntarily established <b>audit</b> <b>committees.</b> Findings – The results are consistent with the hypothesis that incentives to voluntarily form <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> increase with agency costs of debt. The results show a significant and positive association between cost of debt, firm size, number of directors on the board, the proportion of independent directors, independent board chair and the voluntary formation of <b>audit</b> <b>committees.</b> Research limitations/implications – Results indicate that firm size is not necessarily the primary influence in voluntary formation of <b>audit</b> <b>committees.</b> Board size and the proportion of independent directors and having an independent board chair also have a significant influence on the decision. These results suggest that <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> will be established in high agency cost of debt situations, where there are economies of scale and are reflective of a desire to reduce information asymmetries and the liability exposure of outside directors. Originality/value – This study provides useful insights and direction in examining voluntary formation in an Australian context using non-top 500 firms. The results have implications for regulators in considering making <b>audit</b> <b>committees</b> mandatory for all listed companies. 19 page(s...|$|R
