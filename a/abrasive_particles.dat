50|$|Abrasive {{machining}} {{works by}} forcing the <b>abrasive</b> <b>particles,</b> or grains, into {{the surface of}} the workpiece so that each particle cuts away a small bit of material. Abrasive machining is similar to conventional machining, such as milling or turning, because each of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>particles</b> acts like a miniature cutting tool. However, unlike conventional machining the grains are much smaller than a cutting tool, and the geometry and orientation of individual grains are not well defined. As a result, abrasive machining is less power efficient and generates more heat.The grain size may be different based on the machining. For rough grinding, coarse abrasives are used. For fine grinding, fine grains (abrasives) are used.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Purpose of this {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of surface modifications on the tensile bond strength between zirconia ceramic and resin. Methods: Zirconia ceramic surfaces were treated with 150 -Î¼m <b>abrasive</b> alumina <b>particles,</b> 150 -Î¼m <b>abrasive</b> zirconia <b>particles,</b> argon-ion bombardment, gas plasma, and piranha solution (H 2 SO 4 :H 2 O 2 = 3 : 1). In addition, slip casting surfaces were examined. Untreated surfaces were used as the control group. Tensile bond strengths (TBS) were measured after water storage for 3 days or 150 days with additional 37, 500 thermal cycling for artificial aging. Statistical analyses were performed with 1 -way and 3 -way ANOVA, followed by comparison of means with the Tukey HSD test. Results: After storage in distilled water for three days at 37 Â°C, the highest mean tensile bond strengths (TBS) were observed for zirconia ceramic surfaces abraded with 150 -Î¼m <b>abrasive</b> alumina <b>particles</b> (TBSAAP = 37. 3 MPa, TBSCAAP = 40. 4 MPa), and 150 -Î¼m <b>abrasive</b> zirconia <b>particles</b> (TBSAZP = 34. 8 MPa, TBSCAZP = 35. 8 MPa). Also a high TBS was observed for specimens treated with argon-ion bombardment (TBSBAI = 37. 8 MPa). After 150 days of storage, specimens abraded with 150 -Î¼m <b>abrasive</b> alumina <b>particles</b> and 150 -Î¼m <b>abrasive</b> zirconia <b>particles</b> revealed high TBS (TBSAAP = 37. 6 MPa, TBSCAAP = 33. 0 MPa, TBSAZP = 22. 1 MPa and TBSCAZP = 22. 8 MPa). A high TBS was observed also for specimens prepared with slip casting (TBSSC = 30. 0 MPa). A decrease of TBS was observed for control specimens (TBSUNT = 12. 5 MPa, TBSCUNT = 9. 0 MPa), specimens treated with argon-ion bombardment (TBSBAI = 10. 3 MPa) and gas plasma (TBSGP = 11. 0 MPa). A decrease of TBS was observed also for specimens treated with piranha solution (TBSPS = 3. 9 MPa, TBSCPS = 4. 1 MPa). A significant difference in TBS after three days storage was observed for specimens treated with different methods (p 0. 05), CAAP(p > 0. 05) and SC(p > 0. 05).
