These textures provide information related to sequential stages of ore formation, yet their mechanism of growth is poorly understood. This study has analysed a series of colloform samples from the Galmoy Zn + Pb mine, Ireland. Results indicate that the growth sequence is not always intuitive and layers that appear stratigraphic upon cursory observation may not be. The crystal preferred orientation (CPO) of discrete colloform layers abruptly switches between different orientation axes. Examination of the same layers using in situ laser sulphur isotope analysis reveals equally striking changes in 34 <b>S</b> <b>signature</b> between end-member bacteriogenic (25 ‰) and hydrothermal (+ 10 ‰) sources.

Additionally, we (3) compared the current trophic structure of Florida Bay to a prior trophic structure recorded in historical specimens collected {{before the onset of}} the environmental distur-bance.
