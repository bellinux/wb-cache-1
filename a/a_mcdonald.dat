5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick <b>A.</b> <b>McDonald</b> appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

Once in Edmonton, he used this freight as the initial inventory of a store, the <b>A.</b> <b>McDonald</b> Company, where he entered into a partnership. In 1891, he would purchase the store from its original owner, <b>A.</b> <b>McDonald.</b> He {{moved into a new}} building in 1893, designed by architect William S. Edmiston and constructed by contractor Kenneth McLeod. The building, located on Jasper Avenue, included a cellar, main floor for merchandise and storage, and an upper storey, heated in its entirety by a furnace. He would operate until 1896. After the sale of the store, he entered into the real estate and coal business. In 1914, Cameron was serving as managing director and treasurer of Gainford Colleries Ltd. and as chairman of the provisional directors of the Canada Northwest Loan and Mortgage Company.|$|E

500|$|The Ohio Works {{team was}} {{organized}} in Youngstown, in 1902, under {{the sponsorship of}} Joseph <b>A.</b> <b>McDonald,</b> superintendent of the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company. In 1905, the club joined the Class C Division, Ohio–Pennsylvania League, which was founded that year in Akron, Ohio, by veteran ballplayer Charlie Morton. [...] The league's Ohio members included clubs from Akron, Barberton, Bucyrus, Canton, Kent, Lima, Massillon, Mount Vernon, Newark, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, Wooster, Youngstown, and Zanesville, while Pennsylvania was initially represented by teams from Braddock, Butler, Homestead, and Sharon. [...] Within {{the first two weeks}} of the season, clubs from Lancaster and McKeesport also joined the league. Only eight of the original 21 participating clubs finished the 1905 season, however. [...] These included clubs from Akron, Homestead, Lancaster, Newark, Niles, Sharon, Youngstown, and Zanesville. [...] The name, [...] "Youngstown Ohio Works", became officially associated with the Youngstown team when it joined the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. From the outset, the Youngstown ball club was managed by ex-major leaguer Marty Hogan, a former outfielder for the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Browns.|$|E
500|$|After {{retiring}} as {{a baseball}} player, Hogan settled in Youngstown {{and went into}} business. [...] At some point, Sam Wright, then sports editor of The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, encouraged him to manage the city's baseball team. In 1902, Hogan was hired as manager of the Youngstown Ohio Works, an independent ball club sponsored by Joseph <b>A.</b> <b>McDonald,</b> superintendent of the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company. [...] The club did not immediately become associated with an independent league, however. [...] On April 5, 1902, Sporting Life noted that Hogan represented the Youngstown club at a poorly attended meeting of the Western Association, a short-lived independent league based in Cleveland. [...] "Marty Hogan arrived at noon and wanted a franchise for Youngstown", the paper reported, [...] "but Zanesville, Springfield and South Bend, who had asked {{to be admitted to}} membership, had no representatives present". [...] Then, in January 1904, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had [...] "declined the proposition to put a Central League into Youngstown". [...] In May 1905, however, the Youngstown club was one of eleven teams to join the Protective Association of Independent Clubs, which formed the basis of the Class C Division Ohio–Pennsylvania League. [...] Ultimately, the league trimmed down to eight teams from the following cities: Akron, Ohio; Homestead, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Newark, Ohio; Niles, Ohio; Sharon, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, and Zanesville, Ohio. [...] That September, the Youngstown Ohio Works won the league championship, although sources disagree on the team's final record. [...] As baseball researcher John Zajc writes: [...] "The Reach Guide (1906) credits Youngstown with an 8432 won-lost record where the Spalding Guide of the same year lists a 9035 record. The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball (1993) tells a third story, giving Youngstown an 8835 mark".|$|E

2500|$|Donald Creighton (1902–1979) was {{a leading}} {{historian}} who built upon the Staples thesis in his The Commercial Empire of the St-Lawrence: 1760-1850 (1937). His Laurentian thesis showed how the English merchant class Came to dominate Canadian business through their control of the export of staples via the St-Lawrence River. They made Montreal economic, business and financial capital of Canada. In his enormously influential biography of John <b>A.</b> <b>McDonald,</b> Creighton argued that McDonald had built upon and extended the Laurentian model by his creation of the transcontinental railway. [...] More than that, Creighton transformed Canadian political history. For years scholars had complained about the old-fashioned, narrow, constitutional approach. They hoped Creighton could modernize the field and he came through, by adding not just biography, but also social, cultural, and especially long-term economic patterns as the matrix on which Canadian politics was played out.|$|E
