50|$|The {{limits to}} long pulse {{durations}} are {{the number of}} transferred electrons to the <b>anode,</b> <b>sputter</b> caused by ion bombardment at the cathode, and the temperature gradients of the glass. Pulses that are too long can vaporize large amounts of metal from the cathode, while overheating the glass will cause it to crack lengthwise. For continuous operation the cooling is the limit. Discharge durations for common flashtubes range from 0.1 microsecond to tens of milliseconds, and can have repetition rates of hundreds of hertz. Flash duration can be carefully controlled {{with the use of}} an inductor.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} a number of parameters affecting the performance of the SuperHILAC 2. 5 MV Adam injector source. The description will emphasize <b>anode</b> <b>sputtered</b> materials, and will discuss in some detail calcium and gold ion production. Parameters varied include electrode geometry, support gas type and electrode bias, to optimize beam intensity and electrode consumption. A factor of three improvement with high n$sup +$ gold ions appears evident with a new displaced electrode geometry. The source is operated in cold mode, is pulsed and operates usually at less than 0. 6 amperes average current. Under these conditions source life has been measured to be sixteen hours at 25 percent duty factor when generating calcium ions with neon support gas. (auth...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{sputtering}} {{occurring at}} the cathode, the colors emitted from regions near the cathode {{are quite different}} than the <b>anode.</b> Particles <b>sputtered</b> from the cathode are excited and emit radiation from the metals and oxides {{that make up the}} cathode. The radiation from these particles combines with radiation from excited carrier gas, giving the cathode region a white or blue color, while {{in the rest of the}} tube, radiation is only from the carrier gas and tends to be more monochromatic.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we made {{flexible}} OLED's {{based on}} polyethersulfone(PES) film which has high transmittance in visible region and high glass transition temperature(Tg 223 degrees C). UV hand coating {{was conducted on}} the PES base film followed by SiO 2 gas barrier layer and aluminium gallium Zinc Oxide(AGZO) /Ag/AGZO transparent multi layer <b>anode</b> by roll-to-roll <b>sputtering.</b> The SiO 2 gas barrier was found to be more effective than the UV hand coating as well as enabling the AGZO/Ag/AGZO multilayer anode deposition by roll-to-roll sputter. The relatively high luminance and current efficiency of the flexible OLED with AGZO/Ag/AGZO multilayer anode could be explained by the decreased energy level close to that of NPB hall injection Layer as well as the micro cavity effect of the multilayer anode and gas barrier layerclose 1...|$|R
40|$|Single cell solid {{oxide fuel}} cells {{supported}} on single crystal YSZ electrolytes with patterned Ni <b>anodes</b> fabricated through <b>sputter</b> deposition and photolithographic techniques and with porous LSM/YSZ cermet cathodes were tested electrochemically {{to assess the}} stability of the Ni anodes in SOFC environments. Anode stability and electrochemical performance for H 2, CO and CH 4 electrochemical oxidation were characterized at cell temperatures between 750 ºC and 800 ºC under humidified (PH 20 /Pfuel = 0. 05) conditions. Changes in performance of anodes polarized by typical working fuel cell overpotentials (100 - 200 mV) were compared to anodes kept at open circuit conditions. An increase in surface roughness was much greater for the polarized anodes than those kept under open circuit conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and sweep voltammetry, over 10 continuous hours of testing, consistently showed constant performance for the polarized anodes and a drop in performance for the open circuit anodes...|$|R
30|$|ZrO 2 and YSZ {{were grown}} on the AAO {{templates}} using a commercial ALD reactor (TFS- 200, Beneq, Finland) at 200  °C. Tetrakis(ethylmethylamino)zirconium [TEMAZr] (UP Chem., Korea) and Tris(methylcyclopentadienyl)yttrium [(MeCp) 3 Y] (Strem Chem., USA) {{were used as}} metal containing reactants preheated at 80 and 130  °C, respectively. Deionized water was used as oxygen source and delivered at room temperature. Dried N 2 was used as purge/carrier gas. Both ZrO 2 and YSZ thin films depositions were used in expose-mode protocol, where a full ALD cycle is consisting of 10  s pulse, 50  s waiting, and 60  s purging. For the deposition of cubic phase YSZ films, 7 ALD cycles of ZrO 2 layer and 1 ALD cycle of Y 2 O 3 layer were repeatedly deposited for desired thickness [16]. Porous Pt thin films were deposited on both cathode and <b>anode</b> by DC <b>sputtering</b> (Cressington 308 R, Cressington, UK) at room temperature in 10  Pa Ar ambient[15].|$|R
40|$|Si {{electrodes}} are {{the most}} important high capacity substitutes of Li metal and carbon anodes in high energy density Li ion batteries, including those based on sulfur or air cathodes. In this study we examined amorphous columnar structure silicon film <b>anodes</b> prepared by <b>sputtering</b> in rechargeable Li ion battery prototypes based on TiS 2 cathodes. The choice of this cathode material enabled focusing on the examination of pre-lithiated Si films as anode candidates in alkyl carbonate electrolyte solutions. The effectiveness of fluoro-ethylene carbonate (FEC) as a co-solvent in alkyl carbonates/LiPF 6 solutions for good performance of silicon anodes was exhibited. Hundreds of cycles were demonstrated in full Li ion cells containing these components. The columnar morphology of these anodes is retained after 1000 cycles. Their surface chemistry, measured by EDS and XPS is discussed. The results of this work encourage further R&D efforts toward the use of amorphous silicon films as anodes in advanced rechargeable Li batteries...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} surface {{structural}} damage on graphitic anodes, commonly observed in tested Li-ion cells, was investigated. Similar surface structural disorder was artificially induced in Mag- 10 synthetic graphite <b>anodes</b> using argon-ion <b>sputtering.</b> Raman microscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) measurements confirmed that Ar-ion sputtered Mag- 10 electrodes display similar degree of surface degradation as the anodes from tested Li-ion cells. Artificially modified Mag- 10 anodes showed double the irreversible charge capacity during the first formation cycle, compared to fresh un-altered anodes. Impedance spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy on surface modified graphite anodes indicated {{the formation of a}} thicker and slightly more resistive SEI layer. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis of solvent extracts from the electrodes detected the presence of new compounds with M{sub w} on the order of 1600 g mol{sup - 1 } for the surface modified electrode with no evidence of elevated M{sub w} species for the unmodified electrode. The structural disorder induced in the graphite during long-term cycling maybe responsible for the slow and continuous SEI layer reformation, and consequently, the loss of reversible capacity due to the shift of lithium inventory in cycled Li-ion cells...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the fabrication of compact stoichiometric copper indium gallium selenium (CIGS) thin-films is reported. It uses {{a solution of}} CuCl 2, GaCl 3 and H 2 SeO 3, pH adjusted with HCl with LiCl as additive employing a high purity graphite plate <b>anode</b> and Mo <b>sputtered</b> glass cathode during a simplified sequential pulsed current electrodeposition which avoids impurities {{from the use of}} a reference electrode during deposition and a separate selenization step. A Cu-Ga-Se film is optimally deposited by optimizing the deposition voltage, followed by deposition of In from InCl 3 solution, and then annealing of the Cu-Ga-Se/In thin-film in an Argon atmosphere at 550 °C. A single phase chalcopyrite CIGS forms with a compact morphology and well-controlled composition of individual elements. The flat-band potential and carrier density of CIGS thin-films are − 0. 15 V and 2. 6 × 1016 cm− 3, respectively, as determined by Mott–Schottky studies. The photoelectrochemical performance of CIGS films shows a photocurrent density of − 0. 8 mA cm− 2 at − 0. 4 V vs. SCE, an eight fold increment compared to our previous reported value. This simplified preparation using pulse plating gives superior quality CIGS films which are promising for application in thin-film solar cells and photoelectrochemical cells...|$|R
40|$|This design {{offers a}} larger surface area for pumping of active gases {{and reduces the}} mass of the pump by {{eliminating}} the additional vacuum enclosure. There are three main components to this ion pump: the cathode and anode pumping elements assembly, the vacuum enclosure (made completely of titanium and used as the cathode and maintained at ground potential) containing the assembly, and the external magnet. These components are generally put in a noble diode (or differential) configuration of the ion pump technology. In the present state of the art, there are two cathodes, one made of titanium and the other of tantalum. The anodes are made up of an array of stainless steel cylinders positioned between the two cathodes. All the elements of the pump are in a vacuum enclosure. After the reduction of pressure in this enclosure to a few microns, a voltage is applied between the cathode and the anode elements. Electrons generated by the ionization are accelerated toward the anodes that are confined in the anode space by the axial magnetic field. For the generation of the axial field along the anode elements, the magnet is designed in a C-configuration and is fabricated from rare earth magnetic materials (Nd-B-Fe or Sm-Co) possessing high energy product values, and the yoke is fabricated from the high permeability material (Hiperco- 50 A composed of Fe-Co-V). The electrons in this region collide with the gas molecules and generate their positive ions. These ions are accelerated into the cathode and eject cathode material (Ti). The neutral atoms deposit on the anode surfaces. Because of the chemical activity of Ti, the atoms combine with chemically active gas molecules (e. g. N 2, O 2, etc.) and remove them. New layers of Ti are continually deposited, and the pumping of active gases is thus accomplished. Pumping of the inert gases is accomplished by their burial several atomic layers deep into the cathode. However, they tend to re-emit if the entrapping lattice atoms are sputtered away. For stable pumping of inert gases, one side of the cathode is made of Ta. Impaction on Ta produces energetic, neutral atoms that pump the inert gases on the anode structure at the peripheral areas of the cathodes (between anode rings). For inert gases stability, a post design has been implemented. Here, posts of cathode material (Ti) are mounted on the cathode. These protrude into the initial part of the <b>anode</b> elements. Materials <b>sputtered</b> from the posts condense on the anode assembly and on the cathode plane at higher rates than in the normal diodes due to enhanced sputtering at glancing angles from geometrical considerations. This increases pumping by burial. This post design has enhanced pumping rates for both active and inert gases, compared with conventional designs...|$|R
