25|$|Whitman was re-elected in 1997, {{narrowly}} defeating Jim McGreevey, {{the mayor}} of Woodbridge Township, who criticized Whitman's record on property taxes and automobile insurance rates.

25|$|After a {{progression}} of lesser western {{films in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, Stewart transitioned from cinema to television. In the 1950s he had made guest appearances on the Jack Benny Program. Stewart first starred in the NBC comedy The Jimmy Stewart Show, on which he played <b>a</b> <b>college</b> <b>professor.</b> He followed it with the CBS mystery Hawkins, in which he played a small town lawyer investigating cases, similar to his character in Anatomy of a Murder. The series garnered Stewart a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Dramatic TV Series, but failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with Shaft, another high-quality series but with a starkly conflicting demographic, and was cancelled after one season. During this time, Stewart periodically appeared on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show, sharing poems he had written at different times in his life. His poems were later compiled into a short collection, Jimmy Stewart and His Poems (1989).|$|E
