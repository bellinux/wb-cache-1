5|$|Although {{the winds}} rapidly {{decreased}} after landfall, the storm maintained a well-defined structure as it crossed from Mozambique into Zimbabwe late on February22. Weakening to tropical depression status, Eline crossed Zimbabwe and maintained its circulation, entering Botswana on February24. Three days later, the center drifted into eastern Namibia <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, dissipating on February29. After the circulation dissipated, the residual system merged with a heat low and an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{moving over}} warm waters, Elida began to weaken because it began an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. When the cycle ended, the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened. Elida fell to {{a tropical storm}} on July 27, then degenerated into a remnant low <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast. The remnant dissipated over the open ocean about 535mi (861km) west of Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|On September28, {{a system}} {{developed}} into a tropical depression, simultaneously with Tropical Storm Monica.. It headed generally westward and on September29, 18 hours after Monica did it, strengthened into a tropical storm. Nanette continued out to sea and slowly strengthened. It peaked in windspeed of 50mph (85km/h) on October3 <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest. It then slowly weakened. On October4, it weakened into a tropical depression and then degenerated into a disturbance that same day. No damage or deaths were reported.|$|E

5|$|A {{depression}} {{formed on}} October 18 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal {{and moved to the}} north. It gradually intensified <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, becoming a cyclonic storm on October 20. The storm became the second severe cyclonic storm of the season the following day, and turned onto a more northerly track towards the Ganges Delta. The storm peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph) before it made landfall near the West Bengal-East Pakistan border during the morning of October 23. The storm then crossed over East Pakistan, before dissipating over southern Assam on October 24.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|An {{unstable}} area {{developed a}} circulation {{and became a}} tropical depression on July 4. It headed west- northwest and became a tropical storm on July 7. The next day, it was a hurricane <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. Continuing to strengthen, it reached Category4 intensity on July 9. This windspeed was the highest of the season. The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually weakened. By July 11 it was nearly stationary. It then headed northwestward again and continued weakening, becoming a tropical storm on July 13. It weakened into a depression on July 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter. Denise brought winds of near-gale force to parts of Mexico, but otherwise caused no damage or casualties.|$|E
5|$|By 1200UTC on February14, Nancy {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Shortly after, the JTWC assessed Nancy to have peaked with winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds). Increasing forward motion {{to the southeast}} and increasing wind shear caused Nancy to weaken. Early on February15, the storm passed directly over Manuae. Continued weakening took place as a trough approached from the southwest. By February16, Nancy weakened below hurricane intensity <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest as it began to undergo a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Olaf to the north.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Carrie was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and second hurricane of the year, Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September2, a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September5. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September8 as a Category 4hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared Bermuda on September14. However, Carrie passed well north of the island <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast towards Europe. Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September23, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, Somali army {{officers}} led by Siad Barre {{carried out a}} bloodless coup in 1969, creating the socialist Somali Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union vowed to support Somalia. Four years later, the pro-American Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a 1974 coup by the Derg, a radical group of Ethiopian {{army officers}} led by the pro-Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam, who built up relations with the Cubans and the Soviets. When fighting between the Somalis and Ethiopians {{broke out in the}} 1977–1978 Somali-Ethiopian Ogaden War, Barre lost his Soviet support <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Safari Club—a group of pro-American intelligence agencies including Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia—for support and weapons. The Ethiopian military was supported by Cuban soldiers along with Soviet military advisors and armaments.|$|E
5|$|On January3, the BoM and the JTWC ceased issuing {{advisories}} on Tropical Cyclone Phil in the Australian region, which previously {{moved over}} Western Australia. The system continued to the west, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on January5. On January8, {{the remnants of}} Phil slowed <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast. The next day, the JTWC began reissuing advisories on Phil. The storm meandered and executed a small loop, {{and in the process}} reached peak 1minute winds of 85km/h (50mph). Phil turned back to the southwest, and the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on January12. Four days later, the circulation dissipated. Also in January, the JTWC briefly tracked Tropical Cyclone 18S from the Australian region, which entered the south-west Indian Ocean on January12. At that time, the storm had peak 1minute winds of 85km/h (50mph), although it quickly weakened and dissipated on January13.|$|E

5|$|The new {{tropical}} cyclone moved quickly west-northwestward away from South America, and on August30 reconnaissance aircraft recorded winds of 45mph (75km/h). Based on the observation, the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status {{and given the}} name Francelia. Strengthening continued to near hurricane-force, but the fast-moving circulation outran the convection, causing brief weakening as it passed south of Jamaica. Although initially forecast to continue to the west-northwest, Francelia slowed <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-southwest on September1 due to a ridge to its north. Concurrently, the storm intensified into hurricane status after its winds reached 75mph (120km/h), and late on September1 Francelia passed over Swan Island. During its passage, an atmospheric sounding occurred in its eye; a sounding is a measurement of the physical properties of the atmosphere, and the process had only occurred four times previously.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Laura was {{the final}} storm in the active 1971 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season. It formed on November12 in the western Caribbean Sea, and reached winds of 70mph (120km/h) as it approached western Cuba. Across the island, Laura produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 32.5inches (83cm). The resulting flooding killed one person and caused crop damage. 26,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes. Initially, Laura was forecast to move across the island and impact the southern United States, but it executed a small loop <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest. The storm moved ashore on Belize, one of only four November storms to affect the country. Little impact occurred during Laura's final landfall, and it dissipated on November22 over central Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Higos was {{considered}} the third strongest typhoon to affect Tokyo since World War II. The 21st named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Higos developed on September25 east of the Northern Marianas Islands. It tracked west-northwestward for its first few days, steadily intensifying into a powerful typhoon by September29. Higos subsequently weakened <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-northeast toward Japan, making landfall in that country's Kanagawa Prefecture on October1. It weakened while crossing Honshu, and shortly after striking Hokkaidō, Higos became extratropical on October2. The remnants passed over Sakhalin and dissipated on October4.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Joan of October 1997 was the longest-lasting super typhoon at the time, {{maintaining}} 1-minute maximum sustained {{winds of}} at least 240km/h (150mph) for 4.5days. Joan, concurrently with Typhoon Ivan to its west, also became the strongest typhoons {{at the same time}} in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The 25th named storm during the active 1997 Pacific typhoon season, Joan developed from the same trough as Typhoon Ivan on October11. It moved northwestward and later to the west, undergoing explosive deepening to its peak intensity on October15. One typhoon warning agency estimated that Joan was among the strongest storms on record in the basin, and that Ivan and Joan marked the first occurrence of simultaneous super typhoons. While near peak intensity, Joan passed between Anatahan and Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Later, the typhoon weakened <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and east, becoming extratropical on October24.|$|E
5|$|After an {{extended}} period of inactivity lasting nearly a month, the ITCZ produced an area of convection on March1 between Diego Garcia and the Seychelles. There were initially two weak circulations, although the one south-southwest of Diego Garcia ultimately became Cyclone Dera. It moved southwestward without much development at first due to hostile wind shear, with the circulation often exposed from the thunderstorms. On March4, the system developed into a tropical disturbance off the northeast coast of Madagascar. Two days later, the storm moved ashore Madagascar about 50km (30mi) southeast of Antsiranana. It weakened and became indistinct over land, emerging into the Mozambique Channel near Nosy Be as a weak low. Convection gradually increased across the region as the track shifted westward. After moving toward Mozambique, the system rounded the ridge <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south just off the coast, passing only 10km (6mi) east of Angoche. Around that time, the thunderstorms began organizing more, allowing the disturbance to intensify into a tropical depression on March8. With warm waters and an anticyclone providing outflow, the depression quickly intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Dera on March9 and soon after developing an eye feature. Also on that day, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 15S.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{just north}} of Somalia, Megh progressed westward into the Gulf of Aden, the {{waterway}} between Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula. This {{marked the first time}} on record when two storms entered the body of water in the same year. By 12:00UTC on November9, the center was beginning to become exposed from the convection due to the unfavorable conditions. Throughout the day, the structure rapidly deteriorated as the storm curved to the west-northwest. At 21:00UTC on November9, Megh weakened further into a severe cyclonic storm, and degraded further to a cyclonic storm by six hours later. While just offshore Yemen, the circulation slowed <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, after the ridge to the north receded eastward. At 06:00UTC on November10 the storm weakened to a deep depression, and three hours later Megh made landfall in southwestern Yemen northeast of Zinjibar, with estimated winds of 55km/h (35mph). The structure eroded significantly over land, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories. The circulation continued inland, and Megh degenerated into a low pressure area by 18:00UTC on November10.|$|E
