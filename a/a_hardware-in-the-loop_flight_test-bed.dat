40|$|The facility’s {{objective}} is testing and verification of the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) under the realistic environment in low Earth orbit. Regarding the evolving ADCS software and hardware, a complete end-to-end verification of ADCS significantly {{contributes to the}} mission success. FACE consists of a hemispherical air-bearing with satellite component platform, preliminary solar simulator, and magnetic field simulator. Besides, the implemented automatic center of mass (CoM) calibration software adjusts the CoM of the whole platform and, thus, it can perform minimal friction motions in 3 axes as if in orbit. Furthermore, the platform provides multi-output power distribution system and WLAN command interface. Thus a self-sustaining satellite is arranged on the platform which can be subjected to various tests. <b>A</b> <b>hardware-in-the-loop</b> test using <b>flight</b> components can be performed simply by mounting the desired sensor or actuator onto the platform.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a recently developed architecture for <b>a</b> <b>Hardware-in-the-Loop</b> simulator for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The principal {{idea is to}} use the advanced modeling capabilities of Simulink rather than hard-coded software as the flight dynamics simulating engine. By harnessing Simulink’s ability to precisely model virtually any dynamical system or phenomena this newly developed simulator facilitates the development, validation and verification steps of flight control algorithms. Although the presented architecture is used in conjunction with a particular commercial autopilot, the same approach can be easily implemented on a flight platform with a different autopilot. The paper shows the implementation of the flight modeling simulation component in Simulink supported with an interfacing software to a commercial autopilot. This offers the academic community numerous advantages for <b>hardware-in-the-loop</b> simulation of <b>flight</b> dynamics and control tasks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the flight test objectives and performance of the Orion Launch Abort System during Exploration <b>Flight</b> <b>Test-</b> 1. Exploration <b>Flight</b> <b>Test-</b> 1, the first flight test of the Orion spacecraft, was managed and led by the Orion prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, and launched atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. This flight test was a two-orbit, high-apogee, high-energy entry, low-inclination test mission used to validate and test systems critical to crew safety. This test included the first flight test of the Launch Abort System performing Orion nominal flight mission critical objectives. Although the Orion Program has tested a number of the critical systems of the Orion spacecraft on the ground, the launch environment cannot be replicated completely on Earth. Data from this flight will be used to verify the function of the jettison motor to separate the Launch Abort System from the crew module so it can continue on with the mission. Selected Launch Abort System flight test data is presented and discussed in the paper. Through flight test data, Launch Abort System performance trends have been derived that will prove valuable to future flights as well as the manned space program...|$|R
40|$|The {{gravitational}} {{and atmospheric}} differences between Earth and Mars compromise flight-testing of Mars terminal descent dynamics on Earth. The inadequacy of Earth testing is particularly acute if aerodynamic induced oscillations must be nullified by the landing control system- {{as is the}} case for the 2003 Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission. In this situation, full-scale Earth tests of the Mars flight hardware- even at high altitudes- will not recreate the Mars dynamics and may not represent a validation of the terminal descent system's performance. Performance validation is then relegated to analysis via dynamic model simulations. Fortunately, dynamic scaling laws can be utilized to design an Earth <b>flight</b> <b>test-</b> even a low altitude Earth <b>flight</b> <b>test-</b> that recreates the important interplay between aerodynamics and gravity as a means of validating these simulations.

For the autonomous flight of the indoor UAV, instead of using onboard sensor information, visual feedback concept is employed {{by the development of}} an indoor <b>flight</b> <b>test-bed.</b> The indoor test-bed consists of four major components: the multi-camera system, ground computer, onboard color marker set, and quad-rotor UAV.

Additionally, this study introduces a filter algorithm to obtain the full 6 -degree of freedom (DOF) pose estimation including velocities and angular rates.
