5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies.

5|$|The Congress Street Bridge was on Connecticut Historical Commission's list of bridges. Local {{businesses}} and residents {{have claimed that}} are experiencing reductions in traffic {{as a result of}} the closure of the bridge <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> increased emergency response times. In 2002, Bridgeport's official historian, Charles W. Brilvitch, stated that the City of Bridgeport promised P. T. Barnum to keep the bridge open and free, forever. The promise was made when the city purchased the previous bridge from Barnum and annexed East Bridgeport in 1864. However, limited funds became a concern, with the money needing to be directed to more important projects.|$|E
5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, who has not aged despite being on the ship {{for the past two}} days. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> caused free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the Ardents potable water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the sewage system. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E

In vitro data suggest that activated protein C exerts an antithrombotic effect by inhibiting factors Va and VIIIa, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> indirect profibrinolytic activity by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In vitro data also suggest that activated protein C may exert an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production, by blocking leukocyte adhesion to selectins, and by limiting the thrombin-induced inflammatory responses within the microvascular endothelium.|$|E
