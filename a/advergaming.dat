5000|$|Marketers' {{approach}} to using entertainment content {{to promote their}} products {{dates back to the}} use of branded products in early motion pictures. It represented a cooperative venture between a filmmaker and a company in which on-screen exposure of a product, off-screen endorsement by an actor, or a combination of those were traded for paid advertising and unpaid promotions by the company. Often products were offered for use in films in return for publicity stills for use in companies’ advertising. The first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture, [...] "Wings" [...] (1927), featured a prominent placement of Hershey's candy. [...] Companies commonly sponsored radio programs, and sometimes even helped write them to include product pitches, as with Ovaltine flavored milk supplement and the [...] "Little Orphan Annie" [...] radio show. early television programs sometimes included branding {{in the name of the}} programs, such as “The Colgate Comedy Hour”, [...] "Texaco Star Theatre" [...] or even [...] "Camel News Caravan". Advertiser-sponsored programming began to fall from favor with quiz-show scandals of the late 1950s, which involved sponsors. This gave rise to commercial breaks and produced 60-second or 30-second ads. [...] A transcendent instance of product placement, one aspect of advertainment, involved the 1982 hit movie E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. The Mars candy company rejected an offer to feature M&M's in the Steven Spielberg blockbuster. Hershey (the sponsor involved in the [...] "Wings" [...] promotion 55 years before) provided Reese's Pieces, and its product's sales dramatically increased, perhaps as much as 300%. Other companies attempted to replicate Hershey's brand-placement success to increase awareness of their brands and generate sales. FedEx gained exceptional brand placement in the 2000 Tom Hanks film [...] "Castaway," [...] and in an unusual arrangement paid nothing for the exposure. The plot involves a fatal crash of FedEx planes, and the company agreed to that negative exposure in return for significant brand presence, even provided filming locations at its package sorting hubs in Memphis, Los Angeles and Moscow, as well as airplanes, trucks, uniforms and logistical support. The increasing popularity of the usage of integrated advertising in films has further grown in recent years as a way to remain present in consumers' minds despite new technology that enables consumers' to largely avoid traditional commercials. Consumers have the ability to avoid such messaging through the commercial skipping feature applied in some Digital Video Recorders (DVR) or simply by switching channels. This has fueled an exponential growth of advertainment in recent years. A Microsoft Surface placement on the television show NCIS, shows use of the tablet, for instance.A growing venue for advertainment is video games, sometimes called [...] "advergaming", where product placement and partnerships may take a more dynamic role, according to researchers. The variables of gaming within ongoing competition may make players more perceptive or active in the face of advertainment. <b>Advergaming</b> examples include billboards advertising for (and product placement of) Bawls energy drink in Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, and billboards for Adidas sportswear in FIFA International Soccer. Gamers' attitudes about in-game promotions vary greatly from tolerant to highly resistant.|$|E

40|$|In today’s {{saturated}} {{media environment}} a unique advertising medium has emerged. Advergames, defined as games {{created for the}} purpose of marketing a singular brand or product, have potential to engage and resonate with target audiences. While in-game advertising has received substantial research attention, advergames represent a “severely underresearched advertising execution” (Wise et al. 2009). This is surprising, given the prevalence of <b>advergaming</b> as a key promotional and marketing tool in industry. Recent reports forecast that 350 million will be invested into advergames globally by 2012 (Campanelli 2008), paralleled by the emergence of an entire sector trading solely in <b>advergaming</b> (Kalliny & Gentry 2010). In 2008, websites of the top 100 United States companies’ included 294 advergames (Lee & Youn 2008), while band, Fall Out Boy generated 350, 000 unique advergame plays in under one month (Bruno 2009). Coca-Cola has long been siphoning funds from its television budget to maintain its suite of advergames (2 ̆ 7 And now, a game from our sponsor 2 ̆ 7 2005), while Doritos’ advergame, Asylum 626 (Asylum 626 2009) is still popular two years after release. More recently, Yellow Pages released “Yellovator” (Yellovator 2011) in Australia, an advergame at the heart of an outdoor and online campaign designed to remind consumers there are new ways to access and use Yellow Pages. Despite this <b>advergaming</b> boom, little is known about how advergames are processed by consumers or whether they are effective. The purposes of this research are to conceptualise <b>advergaming,</b> given the confusing definitions and absence of a comprehensive theoretical model in literature, and to commence empirically testing this framework. Past studies have investigated brand familiarity using familiar or fictitious brands, but they have not been simultaneously examined through factorial studies. In addition, the proposed model introduces a new variable that could be important in predicting <b>advergaming</b> outcomes, brand integration, which is the level to which brands are integrated into all aspects of a game. Departing from prior research, new games were developed and used in an experiment spanning three product categories. A mixed factorial experimental design is adopted to test the combined effects of brand integration and brand familiarity on brand recall and attitudes towards the brand. Results support positive relationships between brand familiarity and advertising objectives of brand recall and brand attitudes. Mixed results were found for brand integration, with support for a positive relationship between brand integration and brand recall confined to data for one of the three product categories tested, mobile phones. However, brand integration was not found to predict brand attitudes. Moreover, another product category tested, clothing, revealed a combined positive effect between brand familiarity and brand integration on brand attitudes. This research contributes to the marketing and advertising literature by 1) clarifying the conceptualisation of advergames, 2) developing a conceptual model of consumers’ processing of advergames and 3) the causal testing of advergames impact upon important marketing outcomes. It also contributes to practice by 1) the development of recommendations aimed at maximizing advergame effectiveness, and 2) guiding digital marketing decision making for campaigns relating to new products versus existing products...|$|E
