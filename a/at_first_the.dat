5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>the</b> dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>the</b> rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E

5|$|Abd al-Rahman was the posthumous son of Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah, who had proclaimed {{himself the}} Mahdi or messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith in 1881, {{and died in}} 1885 {{a few months after}} his forces had {{captured}} Khartoum. A joint British and Egyptian force recaptured Sudan in 1898. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>the</b> British severely restricted Abd al-Rahman's movement and activity. However, he soon emerged as the Sayyid (leader) of the Ansar religious sect, supporters of the Mahdist movement.|$|E
5|$|After a {{prolonged}} struggle, by 1891 the Kalifa Abdallahi ibn Muhammad emerged as sole leader {{due to his}} support from the warlike nomadic Baggara Arabs of the west. He {{proved to be an}} able and ruthless ruler of the Mahdiyah, the Mahdist state. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>the</b> state was run on military lines as a Jihadist state. Later, a more conventional form of administration was introduced. The Kalifa consolidated his rule in Sudan, then invaded Ethiopia, killing Emperor Yohannes IV in March 1889 and penetrating as far as Gondar. The same year, the Kalifa attacked Egypt at Tushki, but was defeated.|$|E
5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>the</b> mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>the</b> Army General Staff gave Matsui an {{assignment}} in France, but in 1907 {{he got his}} wish to go to China, where he worked as an aide to the military attaché and did intelligence work. Matsui worked in China between 1907 and 1911, and then again as resident officer in Shanghai between 1915 and 1919. In 1921 Matsui was posted to Siberia as a staff officer, but returned in 1922 to China where he served until 1924 as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin in the Manchurian city of Harbin and did intelligence work for Japan's Kwantung Army.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>the</b> Whitewater River {{and local}} washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>the</b> art {{of music}} sought purity, limpidity and {{sweetness}} of sound. Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, {{as it becomes}} continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>the</b> {{most prestigious}} reviewers ignored the book, {{leaving it to}} book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} went well, {{with little}} {{resistance from the}} North Vietnamese. By early March 1971 the situation was changing.

It began to muster forces which would eventually number 60,000 PAVN troops as well as several thousand allied Pathet Lao troops and Lao irregulars, outnumbering the ARVN by almost three to one.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>the</b> {{painting}} {{met with}} mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E

In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>the</b> {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it}} was blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and the depression remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>the</b> {{forests of}} the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
