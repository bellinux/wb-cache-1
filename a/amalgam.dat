5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium <b>amalgam</b> {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact. Since the <b>amalgam</b> destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances {{because of the risk}} of it forming an <b>amalgam</b> with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|All {{types of}} dental <b>amalgams</b> contain mercury, which partly is emitted as mercury vapor. All types of dental <b>amalgams</b> corrode after {{being placed in}} the oral cavity. Modern high copper <b>amalgams</b> exhibit two new traits of {{increased}} instability. Firstly, when subjected to wear/polishing, droplets rich in mercury are formed on the surface, showing that mercury is not being strongly bonded to the base or alloy metals. Secondly, high copper <b>amalgams</b> emit substantially larger amounts of mercury vapor than the low copper <b>amalgams</b> used before the 1970 s. High copper <b>amalgams</b> has been developed with focus on mechanical strength and corrosion resistance, but has been sub-optimized in other aspects, resulting in increased instability and higher emission of mercury vapor. This has not been presented to policy makers and scientists. Both low and high copper <b>amalgams</b> undergo a transformation process for several years after placement, resulting in a substantial reduction in mercury content, but there exist no limit for maximum allowed emission of mercury from dental <b>amalgams.</b> These modern high copper <b>amalgams</b> are nowadays totally dominating the European, US and other markets, resulting in significant emissions of mercury, not considered when judging their suitability for dental restoration...|$|R

40|$|The {{classification}} of Curtis-Tits <b>amalgams</b> with connected, triangle free, simply-laced diagram over {{a field of}} size at least 4 was completed in BloHof 2014 b.

5|$|Gold {{and silver}} mining. Historically, mercury was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold mining {{in order to}} help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold <b>amalgam</b> and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for placer mining have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver mining.|$|E
5|$|Mercury dissolves {{many other}} metals such as {{gold and silver}} to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have {{traditionally}} been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals {{with the exception of}} manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum. Sodium <b>amalgam</b> is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.|$|E
40|$|Given the {{controversy}} that has dogged mercury <b>amalgams</b> since they were first used, other restoration products have been recommended as substitutes. The replacement of mercury with gallium gives of a metal alloy whose advantages in terms of physical and chemical properties, if improved, could dethrone the more current mercury <b>amalgams.</b> There is only one problem; the gallium alloys show less resistance to corrosion and this limits their clinical life. Mercury <b>amalgams</b> have been exhaustively studied and {{have been used in}} experimental, and often in clinical, comparative studies with gallium <b>amalgams.</b> Thus, there is no novelty attached to designing a clinical trial to study the corrosion of these latter <b>amalgams</b> since it could simply confirm, or not, the results presented by other authors. This was, indeed, our aim on undertaking this study. However, although studies on the biodistribution of mercury have been carried out on mercury <b>amalgams,</b> we have not found any reference to similar ones being conducted on gallium <b>amalgams.</b> The objective of our animal experimentation has thus been to compare the biodistribution of each metal, both in terms of time and with one another...|$|R

5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable <b>amalgam</b> of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} historian R.C. Dhere, {{winner of}} the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that Vithoba worship may be even older—"Vedic or pre-Vedic", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna. According to this theory, Vithoba is an <b>amalgam</b> of various local heroes, who gave their lives to save their cattle. He was first worshipped by the Dhangar, the cattle-owning caste of Maharashtra. The rise of the Yadava dynasty, which had cowherd ancestry, could {{have led to the}} glorification of Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a cowherd. This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who—according to legend—brought Vithoba to Pandharpur. There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into Buddhism; today, both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc <b>amalgam,</b> using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E
