5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|Though Wilhelm was {{primarily}} a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher {{did not think that}} Wilhelm's knuckleball <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> effective {{for more than a few}} innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only {{last for a}} few minutes, but with Tentacle, the team had grown so large that they worried this <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> boring to players. They assigned Kyle Balda, an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds {{to aid in the}} animation. Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they cut it in half, leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{told him}} that the captain was walking with Mr. Effingham, and that the next pair that <b>approached</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> they. The {{stranger}} fell back, keeping his hat respectfully in his hand, and the two passed.|$|R
5000|$|From 2003 onwards, it {{was decided}} that formulating {{relevant}} security policy and implementing integrated and coordinated <b>approaches</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best done through a small coordination unit that was managed at the Prime minister's level - As such the NSS <b>would</b> <b>be</b> headed at the Prime Minister's Office.|$|R
50|$|This {{bridge of}} 4556 m length is amongst the longest bridges in India. The total length of construction, {{including}} <b>approaches,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 20 km. It is a K-truss bridge. There {{will be two}} rail tracks (up and down tracks) and a two lane road.|$|R
5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that {{allow it to be}} compared to other works.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E
25|$|In December 2015, {{following}} similar earlier announcements, Exxon {{noted that}} if carbon regulations became a requirement, the best <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a carbon tax.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2010 the OFT {{published}} a [...] "review of high-cost credit." [...] In this report {{they concluded that}} changes {{could be made to}} the industry itself, but that [...] "more radical <b>approaches</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required if the Government or others wanted to tackle the wider social, economic and financial context in which high-cost credit markets exist." ...|$|R
50|$|In January 2007, the Secretary of State for Defence {{announced}} that the Metrix consortium had been awarded Preferred Bidder status for Package 1, and Provisional Preferred Bidder status for Package 2. By January 2008, however, the Government had decided that the Metrix Consortium {{is not able to}} offer an affordable and acceptable Package 2 solution and, therefore, alternative <b>approaches</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{researcher}} [...] {{decided that}} {{to assess the}} appropriateness of an interest rate cap as a policy instrument, (or whether other <b>approaches</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more likely to achieve the desired outcomes of government), it was vital to consider what exactly makes up the interest rate and how banks and MFIs are able to justify rates that might be considered excessive.|$|R

25|$|The {{problem could}} be easily solved by conjoining all the {{properties}} of the referent which often leads to long descriptions violating the second Gricean Maxim of Quantity. Another <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to find the shortest distinguishing description like the Full Brevity algorithm does.|$|E
25|$|In 1943 Heim met Heisenberg, who was {{involved}} in German atom bomb research at that time, and told him of his plan to use chemical implosion to facilitate an atomic explosion. This design was based on his idea he developed for a 'clean' hydrogen bomb when he was 18. Heisenberg was impressed by Heim's knowledge, but thought the <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> impractical.|$|E
50|$|Bell {{announced}} {{that although the}} police had concluded no player had taken a bribe, the league would conduct its own investigation of the offers. The championship game would go ahead as scheduled. Filchock, who during the meeting with the mayor had denied being <b>approached,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed {{to play in the}} game. Hapes, who had admitted his failure to report the bribe attempt, <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> allowed to play.|$|R

3000|$|An {{alternative}} to both these <b>approaches</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{to see the}} interface between grammar and discourse {{as a location for}} ‘changing gear’: moving from one type of category to another related type, which is differently constituted. This is more the approach taken in formal grammars, with their division between syntax and pragmatics, and it is also something that I have tried to do (Davies 1979 [...]...|$|R
25|$|Third, {{some critics}} allege {{that the legal}} {{strategies}} of comprehensive campaigns leave workers, unions and elected labor leaders open to legal retaliation. Increasingly, they point out, workers and unions are being sued for libel, slander, tortious business interference {{and a variety of}} other state and federal claims which carry heavy fines. Even labor scholars who have spoken publicly about employer misbehavior have been sued. A more conservative organizing <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> less litigious and less costly.|$|E
25|$|Space {{agencies}} {{have already had}} experience with returning samples {{thought to be a}} back contamination risk during the Apollo era, when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11. At the time, it was thought that there was a low probability of life on the Moon. The precautions taken then were inadequate by modern standards, however. The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations would be needed. A different <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed for a modern sample return.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{avionics}} entrepreneur Ray Morrow and his son, Neil Morrow, founded an {{air taxi}} company. They {{settled on a}} modified version of Rutan's Boomerang design, which they designated the MB-300. They determined that the best business <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to manufacture the aircraft and run the air taxi services themselves. So Ray Morrow founded Morrow Aircraft Corporation in order to design and manufacture the MB-300. In the meantime, they started the SkyTaxi company using Cessna 414s as interim aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In {{the space}} above the planet, {{the battle was}} not going well. The alien ship had broken up into three {{component}} pieces, and had out-flanked the Earth Alliance forces. Draal then appeared to Commander Sinclair, Captain Pierce, and the alien Captain. Draal said that the Great Machine was off limits, and that any who <b>approached</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> destroyed. The aliens ignored the warning, and Draal destroyed them.|$|R

40|$|The glassy-winged {{sharpshooter}} (GWSS) (Homalodisca coagulata) {{is a serious}} pest of grapes {{and a number of}} other crops. Its most destructive characteristic is that it is an efficient vector of the bacterium that causes Pierce’s disease (Xylella fastidiosa). The management of this pest will, in all likelihood, require a multilateral set of approaches. Several of these <b>approaches</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> enhanced if the GWSS could be reared on a large-scale basis, especially with an artificia...|$|R
25|$|The debate {{continued}} through the summer between the two as to which <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best for the Democratic Party. The Hamburg Massacre in July, although limited in fatalities compared to the total from later incidents at Ellenton, Charleston and Cainhoy, persuaded many whites that Governor Chamberlain's administration was unable to maintain order. In most of these events, blacks were killed in much greater number than whites, particularly at Ellenton. Populist Democrats ended hopes of supporting fusion with the Republicans, and the Straighouts became the dominant force within the Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|It is for {{the court}} to decide what weight to give the hearsay evidence. The Court of Appeal has stated that the high {{standard}} of proof is difficult to meet if {{the entirety of the}} case, or the majority of it, is based upon hearsay evidence. The proper <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for a court to consider to what extent the hearsay evidence is, amongst other things, supported by other evidence, the cogency and similarity of supporting instances of hearsay evidence and the cogency and reliability of contradictory evidence supplied by a defendant.|$|E
25|$|A better {{approach}} {{seemed to}} be to offer carrots instead of sticks. In the first place captains were given some leeway by allowing them {{a certain percentage of}} missing troops, without consequences for their payment. Also, in some cases the nominal strength of companies was lowered intentionally, at the same time keeping the amount of payments constant, thereby giving the troops a pay rise in the bargain. But the best <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to have the government take over the entrepreneurial risks of the captain. However, this did only happen in the Republic in the reforms of William III after 1672.|$|E

25|$|Obama had not {{specified}} what his <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> {{although it was}} considered likely that he would appoint a high-level Middle East envoy, in part to free his Secretary of State so that other matters can also be addressed. Hamas expressed a willingness to talk to Obama, who {{has said that he}} will reciprocate only if it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and agrees to abide by past agreements. The Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, has said the Hamas government would accept a Palestinian state that followed the Green Line and would offer Israel a long-term truce if Israel recognises the Palestinians' national rights.|$|E
25|$|Following Tibet's {{unexpected}} offer, the Mount Everest Committee {{decided on}} an {{attempt on the}} summit for 1936 but preceded by a reconnaissance in the current year. Tom Longstaff had been very praising of the Nanda Devi trek and so this <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used for 1935 on Everest. The reconnaissance could be mounted quickly and paid for out of the existing funds of £1,400 {{so that all the}} new funds raised could be allocated to the 1936 bid for the summit. Shipton was offered the leadership of the 1935 slot with Ruttledge's approval. He {{would not be able to}} reach the region before July which was expected to be after the start of the monsoon but this would allow the team to find out whether the monsoon snow had sufficiently consolidated.|$|E
25|$|One {{class of}} problem that {{can benefit from}} the fully quantum {{approach}} is that of 'learning' unknown quantum states, processes or measurements, {{in the sense that}} one can subsequently reproduce them on another quantum system. For example, one may wish to learn a measurement that discriminates between two coherent states, given not a classical description of the states to be discriminated, but instead a set of example quantum systems prepared in these states. The naive <b>approach</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to first extract a classical description of the states and then implement an ideal discriminating measurement based on this information. This would only require classical learning. However, one can show that a fully quantum approach is strictly superior in this case. (This also relates to work on quantum pattern matching.) The problem of learning unitary transformations can be approached in a similar way.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the strain}} values {{used in this}} method were {{obtained}} on the material surface, a plane stress approach {{was used to evaluate}} the surface stress conditions.

5000|$|Intracardiac {{injections}} of drugs were generally used only to provide emergency drugs {{to a patient}} if other <b>approaches</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ineffective; for example if drugs could not be administered intravenously due to individual circumstances. The procedure is performed by inserting a long spinal needle into the ventricular chamber. The needle is inserted in the fourth intercostal space between the ribs. Today it is considered obsolete, and other routes to give drugs are preferred (i.e. via an endotracheal tube or intraosseous (direct in the bone)) ...|$|R
