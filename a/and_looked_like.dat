5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E
5|$|Greene missed {{four games}} in 1975 {{due to a}} pinched nerve, {{snapping}} a streak of 91 straight games started since he entered the league. In December 1975, {{he and the other}} members of the Steel Curtain appeared on the cover of Time magazine. After leading the Steelers to another Super Bowl win after the 1975 season over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl X, Greene missed the first several games of the 1976 season with a back injury. The Steelers started off the season 1–4 <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> they would not make the playoffs. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw was also injured and was replaced by rookie Mike Kruczek. Greene returned and the Steelers defense carried the team to nine-straight wins and the playoffs. With a defense considered one of the best in NFL history, the 1976 Steelers held opponents to an average of less than 10 points per game (138 points over 14 games). During their nine-game winning streak, the Steelers defense recorded five shutouts, including three straight, and surrendered a total of 28 points (roughly 3 points per game). The defense allowed only two touchdowns over nine games. The Steelers were defeated by the Raiders in that year's AFC championship game.|$|E

25|$|On 25 July 1914, {{the council}} of ministers was held in Krasnoye Selo at which Tsar Nicholas II decided to {{intervene}} in the Austro-Serbian conflict, a step toward general war. He put the Russian army on alert on 25 July. Although this was not mobilization, it threatened the German and Austrian borders <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a military declaration of war.|$|E
25|$|The {{final game}} between Jenn Hanna of Ontario and Jennifer Jones of Manitoba {{came down to}} the very last shot. Ontario had control of the game, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> they were going to pull if off at the end. However, in the last end they did not have the hammer, meaning Jones would have last rock. Ontario had a rock on the button that was well guarded, and the only way at it was an in-off a rock sitting just outside the house. Jones made this very {{difficult}} shot, which gave her four points and the win.|$|E
25|$|On 29 March 1997, Port Adelaide played {{its first}} AFL premiership match against Collingwood at the MCG, {{suffering}} a 79-point defeat. Port won its first AFL game in round 3 against Geelong, and defeated cross town rivals and eventual premiers Adelaide by 11 {{points in the}} first Showdown in round 4. At the conclusion of round 17, the side sat fifth – only one win and percentage off the top spot in what was an unusually close season – but it fell out of the finals after recording only a draw from its final five games. Port Adelaide finished its first season 9th, missing the finals on percentage behind Brisbane. The 1998 season was looking very similar to the previous year as they hovered around ninth position for most of the year <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a threat for finals after round 14; but they lost six of their last eight games to finish in 10th place, with a record of 9 wins, 12 losses and 1 draw.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{began using}} Roman letters to write Old English as they {{converted}} to Christianity, following Augustine of Canterbury's mission to Britain {{in the sixth}} century. Because the Runic wen, which was first used to represent the sound 'w' <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a p that is narrow and triangular, was easy to confuse with an actual p, the 'w' sound began to be written using a double u. Because the u at the time looked like a v, the double u looked like two v's, W {{was placed in the}} alphabet by V. U developed when people began to use the rounded U when they meant the vowel u and the pointed V when the meant the consonant V. J began as a variation of I, in which a long tail was added to the final I when there were several in a row. People began to use the J for the consonant and the I for the vowel by the fifteenth century, and it was fully accepted in the mid-seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|The Flyers {{began the}} 2008–09 season by naming Mike Richards the 17th captain in team history on September 17, with Jason Smith having {{departed}} to Ottawa {{as a free}} agent. The Flyers were looking {{to build on the}} success of the previous season, but instead got off to an 0–3–3 start. However, despite a solid December and January and finishing with four points more than the year before, {{for the most part the}} 2008–09 Flyers played inconsistently <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> different teams, playing at the top of their ability one night and a sub-par performance the next. Derian Hatcher missed the entire regular season and playoffs with a knee injury, and Steve Downie was traded to Tampa Bay with Steve Eminger, whom they had previously acquired in a trade with Washington prior to the season for defenseman Matt Carle. Two pleasant surprises were the emergence of rookie center Claude Giroux and defenseman Luca Sbisa, who was drafted by the Flyers in June with the 19th overall pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for R. J. Umberger, a victim of team salary cap constraints. Scottie Upshall also found himself the victim of such a crunch; he was traded to Phoenix in exchange for Daniel Carcillo at the NHL trade deadline.|$|E
25|$|Washington State (WSU) got {{the ball}} to start the game, but on the second play of the game, Connor Halliday threw an {{interception}} to Max Morgan of Colorado State (CSU), but Nolan Washington stripped Rashad Higgins on the ensuing play, giving WSU the ball right back, and they subsequently scored on a Halliday pass to River Cracraft. On CSU's ensuing drive, they were faced with a fourth down during which they punted from their end zone; the punt was blocked, setting WSU up at the six-yard line. After a roughing the passer penalty and then a holding penalty on consecutive plays, both against CSU, Halliday threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Gabe Marks. After the ensuing kickoff, ESPN aired a series automobile and insurance commercials that were amongst the most viewed of the early bowl season. On the next drive, CSU {{was faced with a}} fourth down and short, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> they would punt, but at the last moment called an audible and rushed up the middle for a first down. The next play, quarterback Garrett Grayson threw a 63-yard pass to Charles Lovett, making the score 14–7. CSU had WSU stopped with a sack, however after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave WSU a first down, Halliday threw a touchdown pass to Theron West on the next play. CSU subsequently drove down the field, and kicked a field goal. WSU finished the quarter with a three-and-out.|$|E

500|$|Further showers breathed extra {{life into}} the pitch {{at the start of}} the run chase, and Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before he had scored and the English batsmen played and missed multiple times. Hutton had trouble seeing and playing Lindwall’s deliveries in the deteriorating light with no sightscreen available, and Fingleton described it as [...] "probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test". O'Reilly said Hutton [...] "seemed to have lost all power of concentration <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a man being led to the gallows", calling him [...] "little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [...] ".

500|$|When Walter {{refuses to}} get out of the car to enter a supermarket, he {{mentions}} he is [...] "learning to appreciate cowardice" [...] and that [...] "the lion had a point", a reference, he explains to Peter, about the cowardly lion from The Wizard of Oz (1939). Walter also mentions flying monkeys and talking lions later in the episode, both also homages to the movie. Later, Walter excitedly says he remembers someone who played the banjo <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the kidnapped, deformed boy, and starts humming a tune. Peter completes the tune and explains it is from the movie Deliverance (1972), which depicts murderous, inbred, and deformed people living in rural Georgia. The army experiment was titled [...] "Project Elephant", a possible reference to Joseph Merrick, a deformed person known as the [...] "Elephant Man". When Walter shows Astrid how the moth changes back to the butterfly when they enter the town, he says, [...] " [...] a friend once said ' any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'" [...] This was originally said by Arthur C. Clarke, originally appearing in Clarke's 1973 revision of [...] "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination".|$|E
500|$|Convinced that [...] "Disney does villains {{better than}} anyone," [...] the {{directors}} felt pressured {{to create a}} villain who would ultimately [...] "live up to the classic villains of [...] past films."

Greno believes that Gothel is particularly scary because {{she is not a}} witch, explaining, [...] "She's a real-world-type villain." [...] Considered [...] "one of the [...] hardest characters to crack" [...] by Greno, he and Howard wanted Gothel to be depicted as a conniving villain who is likeable and charismatic enough that audiences would be convinced by her and Rapunzel's unconventional relationship. Greno explained, [...] "if Mother Gothel was a mean villainess, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a villainess and acted scary, you'd be like, 'Why is Rapunzel staying in the tower?'" [...] In early drafts, Gothel was inspired by Ursula from The Little Mermaid (1989), causing the character to become [...] "too dark." [...] Ultimately, the filmmakers voted in favor of having Gothel be subtle as opposed to having her remain [...] "a one-note, domineering mother," [...] similar to Lady Tremaine, Cinderella's cruel stepmother, from Disney's Cinderella (1950).|$|E

500|$|When {{the players}} returned, Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce {{with the new}} ball, troubling the English batsmen. However, Washbrook changed his tactics and decided to eschew the hook shot, even allowing some short balls to hit him on the body. Washbrook drove Johnston for three runs and then pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barneswho was standing close in at short legin the nose. He proceeded to score England's first 16 runs. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved {{the ball into the}} right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took the outside of the edge of the bat. Hutton had trouble dealing with Lindwall, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light, hampered by the lack of a sightscreen. Fingleton described it as [...] "probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test". In a fidgety display, Hutton played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over. O'Reilly said Hutton [...] "seemed to have lost all power of concentration <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a man being led to the gallows", and that he [...] "was little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [...] ".
