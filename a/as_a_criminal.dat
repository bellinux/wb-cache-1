5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> {{lawyer who}} took on {{dramatic}} cases, Macdonald got himself noticed {{well beyond the}} narrow confines of the Kingston business community.

And, while there, he was learning the arts of argument and of persuasion that would serve him all his political life.|$|E

5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal,</b> prone {{to violence and}} stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E

5|$|Bolivia's U.S. embassy {{had become}} {{publicly}} {{highly critical of}} Morales; {{just prior to the}} election, the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia Manuel Rocha issued a statement declaring that U.S. aid to Bolivia would be cut if MAS won the election. However, exit polls revealed that Rocha's comments had served to increase support for Morales. Following the election, the U.S. embassy maintained this critical stance, characterising Morales <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> and encouraging Bolivia's traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, {{he used a}} form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, John Camden Neild, an {{eccentric}} miser, left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert {{used to obtain}} the freehold of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements. The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant {{by the death of}} the Duke of Wellington, including the mastership of Trinity House and the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards. With Wellington's passing, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue. Thinking that the military was unready for war, and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion. Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but {{at about the same time}} a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at Sinop. The London press depicted the attack <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell. Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed as a minister. As public outrage at the Russian action continued, false rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason and was being held prisoner in the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker is portrayed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> mastermind. Introduced as a {{psychopath}} with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster {{in the late}} 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November 2004, Jagannadh met Mahesh Babu at the Taj Hotel in Hyderbad {{to outline}} the film's plot. It {{told the story}} of Uttam Singh, an {{undercover}} police officer, infiltrating a mafia gang <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal,</b> with the intention of killing its kingpin. Mahesh liked the script but suggested Jagannadh tweak the script's backdrop to suit the Telugu-speaking peoples' sensibilities. Jagannadh agreed and also replaced the existing title with Pokiri. Mahesh wanted the film's production to begin in 2005 allowing him to complete his current commitments. While he waited for Mahesh, Jagannadh directed Akkineni Nagarjuna in Super (2005). While reworking the script, Jagannadh took inspiration from Marana Mrudangam (1988) and State Rowdy (1989). Pokiri was produced jointly by Jagannadh and Manjula Ghattamaneni's production companies, Vaishno Academy and Indira Productions respectively, on a budget of 100120 million.|$|E
5|$|Under the symbiote's influence, Peter exposes rival {{photographer}} Eddie Brock, whose fake photos depicted Spider-Man <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal.</b> Soon afterward, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to {{the nightclub}} where Mary Jane now works, but Gwen catches on and leaves. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally hurting Mary Jane, {{he realizes that}} the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he discovers that he cannot remove the suit, but that the symbiote weakens when the bell rings. Peter is able to remove the symbiote, and it falls to the lower tower, landing on Brock, who had been praying for Peter's death. The symbiote bonds to Brock, transforming him into Venom. Brock locates Marko and convinces him to join forces to defeat Peter. Brock hijacks a taxi with Mary Jane on board, and hangs it as bait from a web above a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. Peter seeks Harry's help, but is rejected. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to help Peter as he is being overpowered, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against Brock. In the ensuing battle, Brock attempts to impale Peter on Harry's glider, but Harry intervenes and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening Venom, and allowing Peter to separate Brock and the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider to destroy the symbiote, but Brock dives in, and the bomb kills them both.|$|E
