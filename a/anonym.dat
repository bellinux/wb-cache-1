Hans Gerstenkorn, ein wackerer Mann, hat viele Feinde, die ihn unablässig verfolgen und beschädigen, ja zuletzt gar zu vernichten drohen. Aus allen diesen Unbilden geht er aber doch am Ende triumphirend hervor, besonders zu Heil und Fröhlichkeit der leidenschaftlichen Biertrinker. Gerade in diesem heitern genialischen Anthropomorphismus zeigt sich #Burns# als wahrhaften Dichter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—How {{to secure}} data {{communication}} {{is an important}} problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). General {{solutions to the problem}} are to encrypt the packet payload with symmetric keys. But those solutions only prevent the packet content from being snooped or tampered. Adversaries still can learn network topology by the traffic analysis attack. In this paper, we propose an anonymous path routing (APR) protocol for WSNs. In APR, data are encrypted by pair-wise keys and transmitted with <b>anonyms</b> between neighboring sensor nodes and <b>anonyms</b> between the source and destination nodes of a multi-hop communication path. The encryption prevents adversaries from disclosing the data, and the anonymous communication prevents adversaries from observing the relation of the packets for further attacks. We implement APR on the MICAz platform to evaluate its overheads for demonstrating its applicability in practical WSNs.
