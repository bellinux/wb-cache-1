40|$|In most countries, {{systems are}} in place to analyse food {{products}} for the potential presence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), to enforce labelling requirements and to screen for the potential presence of unauthorised GMOs. With {{the growing number of}} GMOs on the world market, a larger diversity of methods is required for informative analyses. In this paper, the specificity of an extended screening set consisting of 32 screening methods to identify different crop species (endogenous genes) and GMO elements was verified against 59 different GMO reference materials. In addition, a cost- and time-efficient strategy for DNA isolation, screening and identification is presented. A module for semiautomated analysis of the screening results and planning of subsequent event-specific tests for identification has been developed. The Excel-based module contains information on the experimentally verified specificity of the element methods and of the EU <b>authorisation</b> <b>status</b> of the GMO events. If a detected GMO element cannot be explained by any of the events as identified in the same sample, this may indicate the presence of an unknown unauthorised GMO that may not yet have been assessed for its safety for humans, animals or the environment...|$|E

They are entitled to receive a report, which the teleradiology service should send directly to both {{the patient and the}} referring doctor. This report should include the details of the investigation {{and the name of the}} individual who interpreted and reported on the examination. Upon request relevant information on the standards and guidelines on quality and safety in the MS of the teleradiology company (MS of treatment) should be made available from the national contact point of that MS. The MS of treatment must ensure that teleradiology providers provide relevant information, including the availability, quality and safety of the service that is used, and that they also provide the interpretation and clinical advice in teleradiology (health care) as well as information on their <b>authorisation</b> or registration <b>status.</b> It is clear that if a patient suffers harm he/she may take legal action in his or her own MS of domicile. Systems of professional liability insurance or a guarantee of similar arrangement need to be in place.|$|R
