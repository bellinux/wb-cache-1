5|$|<b>A</b> <b>declaration</b> is a {{pronouncement}} {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>declaration</b> {{is only as}} {{effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore <b>a</b> <b>declaration.</b> In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E
5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> under Order 53 because <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> is not a form of prerogative order. If <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of <b>a</b> <b>declaration</b> {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. <b>A</b> <b>declaration</b> is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E

In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{remedies}} {{that may}} be sought by an applicant for judicial review is <b>a</b> <b>declaration,</b> which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court.

In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he or she must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E
