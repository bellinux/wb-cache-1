In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E
50|$|The {{countries}} that have recently reintroduced <b>flat</b> <b>taxes</b> have done so largely {{in the hope of}} boosting economic growth. The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have had <b>flat</b> <b>taxes</b> of 24%, 25% and 33% respectively with a tax exempt amount, since the mid-1990s. On 1 January 2001, <b>a</b> 13% <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> on personal income took effect in Russia. Ukraine followed Russia with <b>a</b> 13% <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> in 2003, which later increased to 15% in 2007. Slovakia introduced <b>a</b> 19% <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> on most taxes (that is, on corporate and personal income, for VAT, etc., almost without exceptions) in 2004. Romania introduced <b>a</b> 16% <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> on personal income and corporate profit on 1 January 2005. Macedonia introduced <b>a</b> 12% <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> on personal income and corporate profit on 1 January 2007 and promised to cut it to 10% in 2008.

25|$|<b>A</b> capped <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> is one {{in which}} income is <b>taxed</b> at <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> rate until <b>a</b> {{specified}} cap amount is reached. For example, in 2014, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $117,000 of gross compensation (resulting in a maximum Social Security tax of $7,254). This cap has the effect of turning <b>a</b> nominally <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> into <b>a</b> regressive tax.|$|R

25|$|Where {{deductions}} are allowed, a 'flat tax' is {{a progressive}} tax {{with the special}} characteristic that, above the maximum deduction, the marginal rate on all further income is constant. Such a tax {{is said to be}} marginally flat above that point. The difference between <b>a</b> true <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> and <b>a</b> marginally <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> can be reconciled by recognizing that the latter simply excludes certain types of income from being defined as taxable income; hence, both kinds of <b>tax</b> are <b>flat</b> on taxable income.|$|R
