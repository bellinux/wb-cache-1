However, for this film Joffe took producer credit and therefore received the Academy Award for Best Picture. The title sequence features a black background with white text in the Windsor Light Condensed typeface, a design that Allen would use on his subsequent films. Stig Björkman sees some similarity to Ingmar Bergman's simple and consistent title design, although <b>Allen</b> <b>says</b> that his own choice is a cost-saving device.|$|E
500|$|Concerning the group's {{role in the}} Catholic Church, {{critics have}} argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a {{personal}} prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a [...] "church within a church" [...] and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid , which some considered to be irregular. In contrast, Catholic officials say that Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope, and {{its status as a}} prelature [...] "precisely means dependence." [...] <b>Allen</b> <b>says</b> that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does not {{have anything to do with}} power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.|$|E
500|$|Some {{suggest that}} other music from Thespis {{could have been}} used in Pirates. Goldberg {{suggests}} that [...] "It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair." [...] Reginald <b>Allen</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "it seems certain" [...] from its [...] "rhythmic structure" [...] that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, [...] "Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys" [...] became the original Act II finale in Pirates, [...] "At length we are provided with unusual felicity", which was later deleted. Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of Pirates was taken from Thespis. However, there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions. Except for [...] "Climbing over rocky mountain", neither author admitted to borrowing from Thespis for later works.|$|E

500|$|Hornung's {{arguments}} {{have greatly}} influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion, but some {{still believe that}} at times the gods were more unified than he allows. Jan Assmann maintains {{that the notion of}} a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom, beginning with a focus on Amun-Ra as the all-important sun god. In his view, Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend. It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods. Then, in the backlash against Atenism, priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way, one that coexisted with traditional polytheism. The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities, while at the same time, the multiple gods were aspects of the one. According to Assmann, this one god was especially equated with Amun, the dominant god in the late New Kingdom, whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods. James P. <b>Allen</b> <b>says</b> that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the [...] "multiplicity of approaches" [...] in Egyptian thought, {{as well as with the}} henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers. He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by [...] "identifying their uniform notion of 'god' with a particular god, depending on the particular situation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Allen {{was born}} Jacqueline Presson in San Angelo, Texas, {{the only child}} of May (née Miller), a buyer, and Albert Jeffrey Presson, a {{department}} store merchant. She was [...] "never particularly fond of her given name", and decided to use her first initial when writing. She would spend every Saturday and Sunday in the movie house, from one o’clock until somebody dragged her out at seven. From that time on movies became very important to her, and Allen knew she wouldn't be staying in West Texas. Allen attended Miss Hockaday's School for Young Ladies in Dallas for a couple of years, but came away, in her words, [...] "having had no education to speak of." [...] She skipped college and at 18 left home to become an actress. In New York, her career lasted [...] "for about twenty-five minutes", <b>Allen</b> <b>says,</b> when she realized that she only liked rehearsals and the first week of performance, and would rather be [...] "out there" [...] where the decisions were being made.|$|E

Those adjectives {{are used}} elsewhere for {{front and back}} vowels respectively, {{which suggests that the}} [...] "thin" [...] allophone was a plain alveolar lateral approximant , like the clear [...] in English leaf in some English dialects or that of languages like Spanish or German, while the [...] "full" [...] or [...] "thick" [...] allophone was velarized like the English dark [...] in full. It is partly uncertain where these allophones occurred. Sihler and Allen agree that [...] was clear when the sound was doubled as , and dark when it occurred before another consonant or {{at the end of a}} word, but disagree on whether clear or dark l occurred before vowels. Sihler says that [...] was clear before [...] and dark before other vowels, but <b>Allen</b> <b>says</b> that [...] was dark before back vowels in pre-Classical Latin and clear before both front and back vowels in Classical Latin. [...] This represents a partial agreement, however, in that Sihler argues the Classical Latin [...] had three degrees of velarization, with a darker enunciation before consonants than vowels.|$|E

The boy apprenticed himself for many years to his favorite cartoonist, Noro Shinpei, an experience detailed in his book Drawing from Memory, as well as the basis of his semi-autobiographical novel The Ink-Keeper's Apprentice.

In some respects, at least, she's absolutely straight--one hundred cents to the dollar is what <b>Allen</b> <b>says</b> of her--and although you might perhaps not have expected this, I believe it would hurt her horribly to feel that Gregory was squandering money that didn't strictly belong to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{can also}} trace, in remaniements of the Chanson DE ROLAND, {{comparatively}} rapid and quite revolutionary variations from the oldest--the Oxford--manuscript. Rhyme is substituted for assonance; the process entails frequent modernisations, {{and yet the}} basis of thirteenth-century texts {{continues to be the}} version of the eleventh century. It may be worth the while of scholars to consider these parallels carefully, as regards the language and prosody of the Odyssean Books of the Iliad, and to ask themselves whether the processes of alteration in the course of transmission, which we know to have occurred {{in the history of the}} Old French, may not also have affected the ILIAD, though why the effect is mainly confined to four Books remains a puzzle. It is enough for us to have shown that if Odyssean varies from Iliadic language, in all other respects the two poems bear the marks of the same age. Meanwhile, a Homeric scholar so eminent as Mr. T. W. <b>Allen,</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "the linguistic attack upon their age" [...] (that of the Homeric poems) [...] "may be said to have at last definitely failed, and archaeology has erected an apparently indestructible buttress for their defence."

5000|$|The exact {{definition}} of Islamophobia {{continues to be}} discussed with academics such as Chris <b>Allen</b> <b>saying</b> that it lacks a clear definition.According to Erik Bleich, in his article [...] "Defining and Researching Islamophobia", even when definitions are more specific, there is still significant variation in the precise formulations of Islamophobia. As with parallel concepts like homophobia or xenophobia, Islamophobia connotes a broader set of negative attitudes or emotions directed at individuals of groups because of perceived membership in a defined category. [...] Mattias Gardell defines Islamophobia as [...] "socially reproduced prejudices and aversion to Islam and Muslims, as well as actions and practices that attack, exclude or discriminate against persons {{on the basis that}} they are or perceived to be Muslim and be associated with Islam".|$|R
