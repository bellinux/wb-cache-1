500|$|In the 1940s, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, <b>a</b> <b>freelance</b> <b>writer</b> <b>and</b> former {{reporter}} for The Miami Herald, [...] began {{to research the}} Everglades for an assignment about the Miami River. She studied the land and water for five years, and published [...] in 1947, describing the area in great detail, including a chapter on its disappearance. She wrote: [...] "What had been a river of grass and sweet water that had given meaning and life and uniqueness to this enormous geography through centuries in which man had no place here was made, in one chaotic gesture of greed and ignorance and folly, a river of fire." [...] The book has sold 500,000 copies since its publication, and Douglas' continued dedication to ecology conservation earned her the nicknames [...] "Grand Dame of the Everglades", [...] "Grandmother of the Everglades" [...] and [...] "the anti-Christ" [...] for her singular focus {{at the expense of}} some political interests. She founded and served as president for an organization called Friends of the Everglades, initially intended to protest the construction of a proposed Big Cypress jetport in 1968. Successful in that confrontation, the organization has grown to over 4,000 members, committed to the preservation of the Everglades. She wrote and spoke {{about the importance of the}} Everglades until her death at age 108 in 1998.|$|E
