50|$|Fodder: Not {{widely used}} as fodder, but in India 1-year-old {{plantations}} are browsed by cattle. Apiculture: The flowers {{are a source}} of pollen for honey production. Fuel: A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark. Fibre: The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Large-scale plantations have already been established, as in Kerala, India, for the production of pulp. Timber: The sapwood is yellow; the heartwood light brown to dark red, straight grained and reasonably durable. The wood has a high basic density (500-650 kg/m³), is fine-grained, often attractively figured and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are <b>available.</b> <b>Tannin</b> or dyestuff: The bark contains sufficient tannin (13-25%) for commercial exploitation and contains 6-14% of a natural dye suitable for the soga-batik industry. In India, the bark is collected locally for use as tanning material. A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark. Other products: An edible mushroom, Tylopylus fellus, is common in plantations of A. auriculiformis in Thailand.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, the anti-lipoperoxidant {{activity}} of some phenolic acids, flavonoids and purified tannins from Quercus sp. was determined. Phenolic acids (10, 25 and 50 µg / ml) inhibited lipid peroxidation by 42 – 51 %. Caffeic acid {{seems to be}} the most potent inhibitor among phenolic acids. Tannic acid, a commercially <b>available</b> <b>tannin,</b> inhibited lipid peroxidation {{in the same manner as}} phenolic acids. The inhibition did not exceed 43 %. Catechin and quercetin significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation at all tested concentrations and the percentages of inhibition varied between 38 and 60 %. However, flavonoid glycosides (rutin and diosmin) did not behave in the same way. Quercus purified tannins showed high inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The observed inhibition was not significantly related to the concentration. Among the four tested tannins, castalagin gave the smallest rate of inhibition (53. 9 %) versus acutissimin B (65. 5 %).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ultrasound}} (38 kHz, 1. 3 W cm- 2) on the dyeing, fatliquoring and tanning of leather {{have been investigated}} and the mechanisms whereby ultrasound influences these processes were elucidated.;Compared with a conventional process, ultrasonic dyeing can either shorten the dyeing time by 40 - 70 % or facilitate low temperature dyeing. This remarkable enhancing effect has been attributed mainly to an increased diffusion coefficient (D) of dyestuff {{in the presence of}} ultrasound. It was found that sonication is more effective in the initial phases than in the late phases of the dyeing process.;Application of ultrasound during the fatliquoring process or simply in the preparation of fatliquors resulted in an increase of leather fat contents (up to 40 %), especially in the inner corium layer, indicating an improved penetration. This can be partly attributed to a reduction of particle size by 20 - 30 %. In contrast to dyeing, ultrasound was found to be more effective later rather than earlier in the fatliquoring process.;Chromium and aldehyde tanning processes were accelerated only marginally (âˆ¼ 10 %) but the mimosa tanning process was speeded up significantly (by up to 100 %) by using ultrasound. Leathers tanned in the presence of ultrasound had shrinkage temperatures 3 - 5 Â°C higher than conventionally processed controls. A more even chromium distribution and less chromium leaching were obtained after using ultrasound. The results showed that ultrasound can increase the dispersion rate and the <b>available</b> <b>tannin</b> content (by 7 %) of mimosa, as well as reducing its particle size by 50 %. It was also found that ultrasonic treatment can prevent mould from growing on mimosa tanned leathers.;It is concluded that ultrasound is more effective in a process which involves a colloidal rather than a true solution system. The prevailing effects of ultrasound on the former processes are to increase the diffusion coefficient and reduce the aggregation. This is due to cavitation. ...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{control of}} metals is technically, economically, environmentally, and aesthetically important. The best {{option is to}} use inhibitors for {{protecting}} metals and alloys against corrosion. As organic corrosion inhibitors are toxic in nature, so green inhibitors which are biodegradable, without any heavy metals and other toxic compounds, are promoted. Also plant products are inexpensive, renewable, and readily <b>available.</b> <b>Tannins,</b> organic amino acids, alkaloids, and organic dyes of plant origin have good corrosion-inhibiting abilities. Plant extracts contain many organic compounds, having polar atoms such as O, P, S, and N. These are adsorbed on the metal surface by these polar atoms, and protective films are formed, and various adsorption isotherms are obeyed. Various types of green inhibitors and their effect on different metals are mentioned in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Tannins are {{characterized}} by protein-binding affinity. They have astringent/bitter properties that act as deterrents, affecting diet selection. Two groups of salivary proteins, proline-rich proteins and histatins, are effective precipitators of tannin, decreasing levels of <b>available</b> <b>tannins.</b> The possibility of other salivary proteins having a co-adjuvant role on host defense mechanisms against tannins is unknown. In this work, we characterized and compared the protein profile of mice whole saliva from animals fed on three experimental diets: tannin-free diet, diet with the incorporation of 5 % hydrolyzable tannins (tannic acid), or diet with 5 % condensed tannins (quebracho). Protein analysis was performed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry to allow the dynamic study of interactions between diet and saliva. Since abundant salivary proteins obscure the purification and identification of medium and low expressed salivary proteins, we used centrifugation to obtain saliva samples free from proteins that precipitate after tannin binding. Data from Peptide Mass Fingerprinting allowed us to identify ten different proteins, some of them showing more than one isoform. Tannin-enriched diets were observed to change the salivary protein profile. One isoform of α-amylase was overexpressed with both types of tannins. Aldehyde reductase was only identified in saliva of the quebracho group. Additionally, a hypertrophy of parotid salivary gland acini was observed by histology, along with a decrease in body mass in the first 4 days of the experimental period...|$|R
40|$|This thesis pursues {{the usage}} of {{oenology}} tannins {{in the process of}} wine making. In the theoretical part the phenolics are defined, because they are essential to understanding the tannins. There is also the influence of phenolics on human organism examined. In the experimental part I work with some wine samples coming from Zámecké vinařství Bzenec. There are five wine samples from 2014 <b>available.</b> A <b>tannin</b> was applied into every sample. These tannins were chosen on producer´s recommendation. The white wine analysis were made two months after the bottling. The red wine analysis were made three months after the bottling.

In the last part of the thesis I display the basic analytical analysis, sensory analysis and spectrophotometry analysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} perform a gene transfer activity using microinjection, an individual egg is needed. The common {{standard operating procedure}} to collect the individual egg is by applying chemical solution to remove the sticky layer covering the egg surface. Among several <b>available</b> solutions, <b>tannin</b> is one of alternative substances {{that can be used}} in performing egg microinjection on African catfish. In this study, the effect of different dosages of tannin solution to remove the sticky layer of eggs was observed. The study was conducted at the Laboratory of Fish Breeding and Genetics, Bogor Agricultural University. Prior to microinjection, the eggs were treated with different dosages of tannin solution right after fertilization.  There were four different levels of dosage used as the treatments i. e. : 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7, and 0. 9 ppm. After the treatments, each individual egg was injected using DNA pmâactin-hrGFP plasmid with a concentration of 20 μg/mL. The results showed that the dosage of 0. 5 ppm of tannin was the most effective treatment compared to the other dosages. This dosage produced 71. 4 % hatching rate and 57. 1 % transgenic embryos respectively...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityThe {{extraction}} into wine {{of selected}} phenolics as affected by season, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), fruit maturity, and selected maceration conditions was studied. Pomace recovery, color, and sensory aspects were also investigated. In {{addition to a}} control treatment (10 days of skin contact), the maceration techniques studied included extended maceration (EM, 30 days of skin contact) and bleed-off (i. e. saignée) applied to reduce must volume by 16 %. The influence of fruit maturity and ethanol were studied by producing wines from fruit with different sugar levels, and by artificially manipulating sugar levels before fermentation to generate different ethanol levels during maceration. Preparative HPLC fractionation of wine proanthocyanidins (PA) followed by HPLC-DAD-MS analysis was undertaken to determine PA distribution. Sensory properties were studied using Quantitative Flavor Profiling and Descriptive Analysis. Wines made from ripe fruit (ca. 24. 5 Brix) extracted 16 % of the <b>available</b> <b>tannins</b> (of which 79 % were seed-derived tannins) whereas in unripe fruit (ca. 20 Brix) this extraction was 12 % (76 % of seed-derived tannins). Ethanol differences as high as 2. 7 % v/v during maceration {{had no effect on}} tannin and anthocyanin extraction, or in the proportion of seed- and skin-derived tannins. Wines obtained from ripe fruit were characterized by attributes such as viscous mouthfeel, sweetness and fruit-derived aromas. Wines made from unripe fruit were characterized by attributes such as fresh vegetal, acidic and lower color saturation. Wine PA distribution followed a non-normal, Rayleigh-type distribution, with concentration peaks at mean degree of polymerization (mDP) 2 (22 to 27 % of total PA mass) and at mDP 6 - 7 (12 to 17 % of total PA mass). The overall effect of EM resulted in increased tannin extraction from seeds (73 to 80 % of seed-derived tannins), lower anthocyanin content, and decreased wine color saturation. This effect was independent of the maturity level and the EtOH concentration. EM increased astringency by 25 to 34 % relative to control wines, and either did not enhance aroma, or was found to decrease fruity aromas. Saignée increased the anthocyanin and tannin content during maceration, promoting the formation of polymeric pigments while favoring a comparable proportion of skin- and seed-derived tannins.

50|$|DeBruce was, in its {{earliest}} days, {{a site for}} one of the Catskills' largest tanneries, employing over 100 men shortly after it was established in 1856. This industry relied on the easy availability of water and hemlock trees, about 5% of the forests. The trees were cut down and their bark, one of the cheapest supplies of <b>tannin</b> <b>available,</b> was peeled off, leaving the timber to rot. The leather was processed in factories near the water and often actually in the forest. The industry quickly depleted the trees, peaking in about 1870, and was entirely gone from the Catskills by 1895, much to the relief of the trout fishermen, no doubt. Bald Mt. in DeBruce was so named because it was left that way by the tanneries.|$|R
