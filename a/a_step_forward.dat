5|$|Dr. Eli Todd also viewed alcohol as the “prominent evil of the day”. On February 22, 1842, the Washington Society of Farmington was formed. They practiced total abstinence, and {{employed}} social pressure for temperance in Farmington. By 1847, 569 people {{were part of}} this society. This was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> as part of Dr. Eli Todd’s attack against alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Gemini was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule {{was larger}} and more {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1991–92 season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and {{replaced}} by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself. While the Rockets {{did not make the}} playoffs, Tomjanovich's arrival was considered <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> In the next year, the Rockets improved their record by 13 games, getting the Midwest Division title, and winning their first playoff series in 6 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics in a closely contested Game 7 overtime loss.|$|E

5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|The Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions {{followed}} with work on monetary co-operation {{and the first}} enlargement to the north in 1973. With that enlargement the Commission's membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission (the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners), which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time. The external representation of the Community took <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> when President Roy Jenkins, recruited to the presidency in January 1977 from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom's Labour government, became the first President to attend a G8 summit {{on behalf of the}} Community. Following the Jenkins Commission, Gaston Thorn's Commission oversaw the Community's enlargement to the south, in addition to beginning work on the Single European Act.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{received}} a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed {{over the course}} of the season without receiving a grid penalty. Power unit supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability of the cars as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their power unit, which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in both power and driveability. He urged the team to pull the introduction of the power unit forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the name TAG Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, International Harvester had pioneered rotary {{combines}} with their Axial flow machines, and were soon followed by other manufacturers, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9550, 9650, and 9750 combines, representing <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in rotary combine technology. The STS system uses less horsepower and improves material handling.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{traditional}} security paradigm humanitarian intervention is contentious. As discussed above, {{the traditional}} security paradigm places {{emphasis on the}} notion of states. Hence, the principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention that are paramount in the traditional security paradigm make it difficult to justify the intervention of other states in internal disputes. Through the development of clear principles based on the human security concept, there has been <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in the development of clear rules of when humanitarian intervention can occur and the obligations of states that intervene in the internal disputes of a state.|$|E
25|$|After the Territory of Hawaii's {{statehood}} in 1959, Japanese American political empowerment took <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> {{with the}} election of Daniel K. Inouye to Congress. Spark Matsunaga was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1963, and in 1965 Patsy Mink became the first Asian American woman elected to the United States Congress. Inouye, Matsunaga, and Mink's success led to the gradual acceptance of Japanese American leadership on the national stage, culminating in the appointments of Eric Shinseki and Norman Y. Mineta, the first Japanese American military chief of staff and federal cabinet secretary, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Webern's {{first piece}} after {{completing}} his studies with Schoenberg was the Passacaglia for orchestra (1908). Harmonically, it is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> {{into a more}} advanced language, and the orchestration is somewhat more distinctive than his earlier orchestral work. However, it bears little relation to the fully mature works he {{is best known for}} today. One element that is typical is the form itself: the passacaglia is a form which dates back to the 17th century, and a distinguishing feature of Webern's later work was to be the use of traditional compositional techniques (especially canons) and forms (the Symphony, the Concerto, the String Trio, and String Quartet, and the piano and orchestral Variations) in a modern harmonic and melodic language.|$|E
25|$|The Malta Gay Rights Movement (MGRM), {{founded in}} 2001, is a socio-political {{non-governmental}} organisation that {{has as its}} central focus the challenges and rights of the Maltese LGBT community. In February 2008, MGRM organised and presented a petition to Parliament asking {{for a range of}} measures to be introduced to protect them through the law. The petition was signed by more than 1,000 people and asked for legal recognition of same-sex couples, an anti-homophobic bullying strategy for the island nation's schools and new laws targeting homophobic and transphobic crimes. The petition received the backing of Alternattiva Demokratika. Harry Vassallo, its leader, said that the recognition of gay rights would be <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
25|$|During that year, Toni {{was still}} {{active in the}} party, writing for Lumea Nouă and {{upholding}} Gherea's political line. His articles touched a sensitive subject: the Law on Mining, passed by the Junimist Prime Minister Petre P. Carp, which did away with the PNL's protectionism and greatly increased foreign investment in the Romanian economy. The PSDMR, committed to the Marxist theory on the relations of production, supported the law as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> into capitalism, but also criticized it for not allowing a state monopoly on mines. Also that year, Bacalbașa dueled with a certain Bogdanovici, having Caragiale as his witness.

25|$|In July 1974, Flynt first {{published}} Hustler as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> from the Hustler Newsletter, which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled {{for the first}} year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August 1975 was a major coup. Hustler has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions of women that some find demeaning, such as a naked woman in a meat grinder or presented as a dog on a leash– though Flynt later said that the meat grinder image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamentally}} different mechanism for memristive behavior {{has been proposed}} by Pershin and Di Ventra. The authors show that certain types of semiconductor spintronic structures belong to a broad class of memristive systems as defined by Chua and Kang. The mechanism of memristive behavior in such structures is based entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the ionic transport in nanostructures. When an external control parameter (such as voltage) is changed, the adjustment of electron spin polarization is delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation processes causing hysteresis. This result was anticipated {{in the study of}} spin extraction at semiconductor/ferromagnet interfaces, but was not described in terms of memristive behavior. On a short time scale, these structures behave almost as an ideal memristor. This result broadens the possible range of applications of semiconductor spintronics and makes <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in future practical applications.|$|E
