5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible for assessing the conservation status of species. A species is assessed <b>as</b> <b>subject</b> to varying levels of threat {{if it has a}} small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% in ten years or three generations). None of the three Delichon species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty <b>as</b> <b>subject</b> to the rule of law.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Todd Garth {{argues that}} I, the Supreme is {{influenced}} by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fernández, {{as well as other}} avant garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the archetype of Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a collective and often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived conceptions of the past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined with the life of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of the individual <b>as</b> <b>subject</b> while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>subject</b> {{distance}} is decreased, the subject magnification increases, and eventually becomes large {{in comparison with}} the hyperfocal magnification. Thus the effect of focal length is greatest near the hyperfocal distance, and decreases <b>as</b> <b>subject</b> {{distance is}} decreased. However, the near/far perspective will differ for different focal lengths, so the difference in DOF may not be readily apparent.|$|E

40|$|Experimentation using {{different}} types of subjects {{is an important issue}} in empirical software engineering. In particular, the use of students <b>as</b> <b>subjects</b> is many times questioned. This paper addresses this issue by dividing subjects into four types, where one type {{can be viewed as a}} worst case. It is discussed how students could be viewed <b>as</b> suitable <b>subjects</b> in the worst case. In particular, if it is possible to reject the null hypothesis then it is highly likely that the outcome is also valid for other types of subjects. An example experiment is presented that uses students <b>as</b> <b>subjects</b> and fulfill the criteria for being the worst case. It is concluded that students are good subjects under certain circumstances and that these types of experiments provide an opportunity for using students <b>as</b> <b>subjects.</b> 1...|$|R
