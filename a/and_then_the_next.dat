In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
25|$|Reisch and Prather pioneered a {{technique}} that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) for E. coli genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for Cas9 expression (cas9) is first transformed into E. coli cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the targeted gene {{of interest in the}} form of sgRNA and the λ-red operon is transfected. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, linear DNA to be incorporated into the E. coli genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA are then induced, which results in the Cas9 locating the E. coli target DNA based on the sgRNA complement. Cas9 is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E

500|$|On December 16 Matsui {{spent the}} day {{recovering}} from his malaria at the Tangshuizhen hot springs east of Nanking, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day he rode into Nanking itself {{at the head of}} a large victory parade. It is not clear to what extent Matsui was aware of the atrocities perpetrated in Nanking. His former Chief of Staff in the SEA later testified that Matsui had been informed of [...] "a few cases of plunder and outrage" [...] shortly after entering the city, and Matsui's own field diary also mentions being told that Japanese troops had committed acts of rape and looting. Matsui commented in his field diary, [...] "The truth is that some such acts are unavoidable." [...] When a representative from the Japanese Foreign Ministry came to investigate the matter, Matsui admitted that some crimes had occurred and he blamed his subordinate commanders for allowing too many soldiers into the city in violation of his orders. After the war, Matsui's aide-de-camp Yoshiharu Sumi claimed that not long after the capture of Nanking Matsui caught wind of a plan by some of his subordinates to massacre Chinese POWs and upon hearing of this he immediately put a stop to it. However researchers have since discovered that Sumi's testimony contained a large number of inaccuracies.|$|E
500|$|Indecision {{over his}} {{sexuality}} in the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol" [...] drew some negative reviews of Blaine. Reiter noted that, [...] "So much of Blaine's charm {{has been his}} certainty about who he is." [...] Though she found his subplot with Rachel [...] "fun", she commented: [...] "Blaine's overwrought speech in the coffee shop after Rachel asks him out just felt off-key. Saying 'bye' to the Blaine sexual-confusion storyline wouldn't make us angry at all." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also criticised the storyline, which, he wrote, [...] "seemed like it might be an interesting, complicated look at teenage sexuality {{and how it can}} seem formed but might be more fluid than most teens would give it credit for, then lost its nerve and took the easy way out." [...] AfterElton.com Chris O'Guinn felt that the only aspect of the storyline handled acceptably was Blaine questioning whether he was bisexual, rather than outright straight. He criticized the shallow examination of his feelings, and wrote: [...] "Bisexuality is such a contentious issue that it should not be fumbled this way. For a character to say 'maybe I'm bi' in one scene <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> say, 'nope, definitely gay' is almost cruel in how dismissive it is toward bisexuals by trivializing the intense confusion that many bisexual people feel in coming to terms with their orientation."

He was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them" [...] and said that it [...] "felt very real for kids in this situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Webb {{stated that}} he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more {{grounded}} physically, a challenge for a superhuman character. The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, Vic and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member. Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director. To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar. Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, [...] "he swings down at the same speed as he swings up," [...] and this [...] "constant" [...] speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where [...] "he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again." [...] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film. While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an [...] "incredible wealth of acrobatics". These rigs were over 200–300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design. According to Andy, operating the rigs [...] "was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering." [...] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated. Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts. Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging. Arad explained that [...] "Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible." ...|$|E
