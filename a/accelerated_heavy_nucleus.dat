40|$|Recent {{results from}} RHIC {{experiments}} {{suggest that a}} hot QCD matter, known as quark gluon plasma (QGP), may be formed in Gold+Gold collisions at a center mass energy of 200 GeV per colliding pair. The LHC is planning to <b>accelerate</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei</b> such as Lead at energies of 2. 75 TeV/nucleon. At these energies {{it will be possible}} to produce a even higher temperature QCD matter. In addition, hard scattering cross sections will increase significantly and they could be used as probes of the QCD matter. RHIC experiments indicate that hard scattered partons produced inside the QGP radiate gluons and therefore modifying the jet properties such as energy angular distribution. The ATLAS detector with its large acceptance is an ideal place to detect and study jets from nucleus-nucleus collisions. Initial simulation studies show most detectors will perform well in a high multiplicity environment, including inner detector tracking. Jet reconstruction is possible with an energy resolution close to the high luminosity proton-proton run. In this paper we present a summary or our initial round of simulations studies of the ATLAS detector in the heavy ion environment...|$|R
40|$|Three {{regions of}} {{excessive}} flux of cosmic rays with energies {{of the order}} of PeV are found in the experimental data of the EAS MSU array at a confidence level greater than 4 σ. For two of them, there are similar regions in the experimental data of the EAS- 1000 Prototype array. One of the interesting features of the regions is the absence of supernova remnants in their vicinities, traditionally considered as the main sources of Galactic cosmic rays, but the presence of isolated pulsars, some of which are able to <b>accelerate</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei</b> up to energies close to PeV. In our opinion, this favors the assumption that isolated pulsars are able to contribute to the flux of Galactic cosmic rays more than is usually assumed. Comment: 7 pages.

40|$|The {{isotropic}} {{component of}} the γ-ray flux between 100 MeV and 100 EeV (10 20 eV) contains important information {{about the origin of}} highest energy cosmic rays and the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). Using numerical simulations of extragalactic cosmic and γ-ray propagation we show that an average fraction of ≃ 10 % γ-rays in the total cosmic ray flux around 10 EeV would imply both a non-acceleration origin of highest energy cosmic rays and a large scale EGMF < ∼ 10 − 11 G. Proposed observatories for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays should be able to test this signature. The highest energy cosmic ray (HECR) events observed above 100 EeV [1, 2] are difficult to explain within conventional models involving first order Fermi acceleration of charged particles at astrophysical shocks [3].
