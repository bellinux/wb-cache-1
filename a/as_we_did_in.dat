The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E

On the one hand, the country could continue to address race [...] "only as spectacle—as {{we did in the}} OJ trial—or in the wake of tragedy, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of Katrina—or as fodder for the nightly news." [...] On the other hand, Americans could come together to solve the nation's problems, in particular the problems of education, health care, jobs moving overseas, the Iraq War, and caring for veterans.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 June 2011, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: [...] "It {{is not in}} the {{interests}} of anyone to send messages to the opposition in Syria or elsewhere that if you reject all reasonable offers we will come and help you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Libya ... It's a very dangerous position." [...] He continued that, [...] "the situation doesn't present a threat to international peace and security ... Syria is a very important country in the Middle East and destabilizing Syria would have repercussions far beyond its borders" [...] and asserted that Assad had made attempts at major reform.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his parents}} separated, his mother {{traveled}} seeking employment, and young Langston Hughes was raised mainly in Lawrence, Kansas by his maternal grandmother, Mary Patterson Langston. Through the black American oral tradition and drawing from the activist experiences of her generation, Mary Langston instilled in her grandson a lasting sense of racial pride. He {{spent most of}} his childhood in Lawrence. [...] In his 1940 autobiography The Big Sea he wrote: [...] "I was unhappy for a long time, and very lonesome, living with my grandmother. Then it was that books began to happen to me, and I began to believe in nothing but books and the wonderful world in books — where if people suffered, they suffered in beautiful language, not in monosyllables, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Kansas." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{inspired}} {{from what}} I have {{seen on the}} street these days: fans who have approached me, the people around me, and from my own personal experiences. I share the sadness that has been created in many by our separation. I, myself, am immersed in that state because few things have been so important {{to me in my}} life as Soda Stereo. Everyone knows {{that it is impossible to}} lead a band without a certain level of conflict. It is a fragile equilibrium in the war of ideas that very few are able to handle for fifteen years, as we proudly did [...] But, ultimately, different personal and musical misunderstandings began to compromise that equilibrium... excuses were generated for not confronting ourselves, excuses for a future group that we no longer believed in <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the past. To end for the sake of the band is, in its redundancy, to [...] to our mental health, and above all to show respect for all of our fans who have followed us for such a long time. Goodbye.|$|E

6000|$|But {{to confine}} {{ourselves}} to the Maples. What {{if we were to}} take half as much pains <b>in</b> protecting them <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> setting them out,--not stupidly tie our horses to our dahlia-stems? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{thought it}} was better than living <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the country, so far apart that we never see one another, hardly. And it seems to me better than not having any neighbors at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is in Ireland, {{arranging}} {{about the}} Oecumenical Council. They {{do not understand}} these matters there <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> England, and his holiness, by the cardinal's advice, has sent the monsignore to put things right." ...|$|R
60|$|Afterwards our {{friendship}} waned, but living <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the same outlying suburb, I {{was bound to}} see {{a good deal of}} him; and to hear more.|$|E
60|$|LORD W. Good God, man--more than that! I want to {{show the}} people that we stand side by side with them, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the trenches. The whole thing's too jolly awful. I lie awake over it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he {{remind you}} of {{the figure of the}} man you saw come out of the mews?" [...] Lord Fawn paused. [...] "We can't make him move about here <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Mr. Wickerby's room; but remembering that as you must do, does he look like the man?" ...|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} no dominance in our market model. This as a concept first appeared inMerton (1973). It is natural to transpose this concept to our setting with uncertainty, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the following definition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{consider}} that we're languid?"--that form of rejoinder she had jumped at {{for the sake of}} its pretty lightness. [...] "Do {{you consider}} that we are careless of mankind?--living <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the biggest crowd in the world, and running about always pursued and pursuing." ...|$|R
30|$|In a {{previous}} {{version of this}} working paper (see Fernández-Kranz and Rodriguez-Planas (2011 a, b)), the authors used the SCPS to evaluate {{the impact of the}} law, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> {{the first part of the}} paper. However, in the cited updated version, they no longer do it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{it about}} Mr. Tedham?" [...] asked Mrs. Hasketh, and I remembered {{now that she}} had always used as much {{ceremony}} in speaking of him; it seemed rather droll now, but still {{it would not have been}} in character with her to call him simply Tedham, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>in</b> speaking of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really came}} for the chance of seeing you alone," [...] said Will, mysteriously forced {{to be just as}} simple as she was. He could not stay to ask himself, why not? [...] "I wanted to talk about things, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Rome. It always makes a {{difference}} when other people are present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, my dear, I {{will not}} doubt you for another moment,' Mr. Hawtrey said, kissing her tenderly. 'Now we just {{stand in the}} same {{position}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> regard to the other affair; we have got to find out all about it. In the first place, get your book of engagements, and let us see what you were doing on the afternoon of the 15th.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> Europe <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not {{go down to}} {{the office}} or bar room, when we are ready to leave a hotel, to call for and settle our bill there, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> America, but <b>we</b> ring the bell in our room, and ask the waiter to bring the bill to us.|$|R
30|$|This {{original}} version does {{not deal with}} spatial properties of items <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this paper. <b>We</b> define below a spatial version of the above problem and while we explore the above solution ideas, we consider spatial heuristics for picking items to ask about. The general notion of cost-latency tradeoffs, however, also applies here.|$|R

60|$|In my {{handling}} of this head, I must show you, First, What the apostle means here by 'save'--'Wherefore {{he is able}} to save.'

Third, And then, thirdly, we shall do <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the foregoing--to wit, gather some inferences from the whole, and speak to them.|$|E

"And {{that day}} at Fiesole among the orange trees, and Pisa and the Capello de Terisa and the Mona Lisa--Oh, Jack, take me away from all this, {{take me to the}} Riviera, among the contadini, where we can stand {{together}} with my head on your shoulder just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the Duomo at Milano, or on the piaggia at Verona.

60|$|We {{were now}} to sail in company, {{and we went}} away from the Cape, the 3rd of September, 1714. We found the {{brigantine}} was an excellent sea-boat, and could bear the weather to a miracle, and no bad sailer; she kept pace with us on all occasions, and in a storm we had at S. S. E., some days after, she shifted as well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the great ship, which made us all well pleased with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{at their}} rate of speed," [...] {{returned}} the younger man. [...] "The crime {{would be in}} going faster.

You can't rush things here <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the North." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{recognize}} that Moslems {{in many parts}} of the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I profoundly regret the distress the publication has occasioned to the sincere followers of Islam.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove {{that three of}} the main propositional logics of {{dependence}} are structurally complete with respect to a class of substitutions under which the logics are closed.

6000|$|We always {{spoke of}} him with formal {{precision}} as Grandfather Garland, never as [...] "Grandad" [...] or [...] "Granpap" [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> alluding to Hugh McClintock, and his long prayers (pieces of elaborate oratory) wearied us, while those of Grandad, which had the extravagance, the lyrical abandon of poetry, profoundly pleased us. Grandfather's church was a small white building in {{the edge of the}} village, Grandad's place of worship was a vision, a cloud-built temple, a house not made with hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It must--I daresay it does,' Millborne replied vaguely; 'and I {{must tell}} you that impulse--I mean in the sense of passion--has little to do with it. I wish to marry you, Leonora; I much desire to marry you. But it is an affair of conscience, a case of fulfilment. I promised you, and it was dishonourable of me to go away. I want to remove that sense of dishonour before I die. No doubt we might get to love each other as warmly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> old times?' ...|$|E

"1st, They {{conceive}} {{the first}} {{establishment of the}} South Sea [...] Company is not rightly stated, for {{no part of the}} debt then [...] unprovided for was paid: however the advantages arising to the [...] public were very considerable; for, instead of paying for all [...] provisions cent. per cent. dearer than the common market-price, [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Lord Godolphin's times, the credit of the public [...] was immediately restored, and, by means of this scheme, put upon [...] as good a footing as the best private security.|$|E
50|$|The {{institute}} {{was founded}} in 1987 following a faculty committee review that concluded Stanford “should be leading the way <b>in</b> International Studies <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> science and technology,” encompassing interdisciplinary teaching, research, public service and administrative functions.

40|$|Congratulations are in order. The pair {{have known}} each other for some time. But the {{relationship}} has now been formalised.
