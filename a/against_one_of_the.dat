5|$|Gloucestershire's return {{game against}} Nottinghamshire began on Monday, 12 August, at Clifton College. Gloucestershire won a low-scoring match by 109 runs after batting first. They totalled 127 (Grace 26) and 137 (Grace 6) which were modest scores, but Nottinghamshire's replies {{amounted}} only to 84 and 71. Grace produced another fine bowling performance with figures of 5–29 and 6–35 <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest batting sides in England.

50|$|Dhanb (plural dhunub) is {{frequently}} applied to heinous sins committed <b>against</b> God. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main examples <b>of</b> Dhanb in <b>the</b> Quran is <b>of</b> “crying lies of God’s signs”, or having excessive pride that prevents an individual from believing <b>the</b> signs <b>of</b> God.|$|R
5|$|Alex Funke, {{who worked}} on The Lord of the Rings, {{directed}} the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th and 1/100th scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A scale model was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed <b>against.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> improvements made over the previous film {{was to make the}} centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers (mechanical stilts with springs), to mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally.|$|E

5|$|Samson was {{betrayed by}} his lover Delilah, who ordered a servant {{to cut his}} hair while he was {{sleeping}} and turned him over to his Philistine enemies, who gouged out his eyes and forced him to grind grain in a mill at Gaza. When the Philistines took Samson into their temple of Dagon, Samson asked to rest <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support pillars; after being granted permission, he prayed to God and miraculously recovered his strength, allowing him to grasp hold of the columns and tear them down, killing himself and all the Philistines with him. In some Jewish traditions, Samson {{is believed to have}} been buried in Tel Tzora in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath {{were elected}} to the newly formed Second Division in 1892, {{and went on to}} win the divisional championship. However, {{promotion}} to the First Division depended on the test match system, in which each of the lowest-ranked three teams from the First Division played off <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest-ranked three from the Second Division. Small Heath lost to Newton Heath after a replay, so were not promoted. The League's Annual General Meeting heard proposals that the First Division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams. Both motions were, unsurprisingly, seconded by Small Heath, but both were defeated, thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1893–94 season. The Second Division championship shield was presented to the club at a meeting of the Football League held at the Colonnade Hotel in New Street, Birmingham, in August.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{had been}} {{building}} among the base's staff in recent days, and most suspected that an attack would come <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> border stations in the near future. Ample evidence of the coming attack was discovered by British patrols, but signs of enemy troop movements were disregarded and newly cleared positions were mistaken for ambush sites. Thus the base was continually left with the bare minimum number of men as the majority that could be spared went out on patrol. As {{a result of these}} conditions, only 36 men were present in the base {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 April 1965 when it came under ferocious attack by 150 to 400 Indonesian troops, supported by artillery and rocket fire. Immediately, the Indonesians swarmed into one segment of the trenches and destroyed one of the two mortars.|$|E

5|$|The Australians spent Christmas Day patrolling {{forward in}} concert with Royal Australian Air Force Boomerang fighters from No. 4 Squadron RAAF {{carrying}} out reconnaissance flights ahead of their position. Throughout the evening, the Japanese launched an attack <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian companies, but this was turned back by the defenders. For several days, the Australian battalion commander formulated a plan to capture Pearl Ridge, possession of which would enable the Australians to block Japanese attempts to approach the main Allied base around Torokina, and would disrupt the movement of Japanese troops along the north–south axis of the island, hindering their ability to reinforce isolated pockets.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{handling of}} Luftflotte 3 {{was not good}} either. The escorting fighters of StG 77 were stretched too far across a 30-mile front. By chance half of the defending fighters went into action <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking Ju 87 groups with disastrous results for the group concerned. The German fighters, which outnumbered the RAF units by 2:1, were unable to protect the Stuka units. Had the targets been closer together, the concentration of fighters would have allowed the Germans to destroy more RAF fighters in the air, while protecting their charges.|$|E

5|$|The {{team had}} two further matches before their {{international}} against England. The first was <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest clubs in England, Blackheath. Andrew Stoddart, who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side, {{played for the}} club in their 9–3 defeat to the Natives. The New Zealanders won having scored four tries, including two by Keogh. Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players. The Natives were again victorious, this time 10–0. The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy frost, and so the team had a seven-day break from playing– their longest of the tour.|$|E

5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E
