40|$|This {{capstone}} project {{presents a}} critical synthesis of recent literature (2000 - 2013) related to <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> {{place in the}} urban environment.

The literature is then reviewed and synthesised for social and built environment barriers and facilitators to <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place, along with two key theoretical models and the World Health Organizations Age Friendly Cities framework leading to a conceptual framework for optimal <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place. It is proposed that this theoretically grounded framework of optimal <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place will help guide future work in the area of <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place in the urban neighbourhood. It was found that the intersectionality of multiple factors affects each individual differently depending on their current level of competence leading to a unique combination of factors involved <b>in</b> optimal <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a hidden variable underlying the recent phenomena of ―aging in place. ‖ That variable {{is the degree}} to which <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place relies on women‘s caregiving. Seeking to understand the connection between <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place and gendered caregiving, and to explore the effects of <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place on the social condition of women caregivers, this paper utilizes a feminist theoretical perspective presented by Dorothy E. Smith to examine popular texts on <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place. Smith suggested that texts are means by which the male dominated relations of ruling exercise power over women by patterning the actual daily existence of women‘s lives (Smith 1990). Adopting this foundation, this paper considers texts on <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place with the objective of learning how the texts pattern the <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place process and how the process creates and reproduces power over women and maintains gender inequality. Popular texts on <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place describe the process as one that both provides independence and can be independently achieved. By ignoring and devaluing the work of caregivers involved <b>in</b> the <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> place process, these texts ultimately work to reproduce women‘s financial disadvantages and limit women‘s participation in positions of power...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ageing</b> <b>in</b> place" {{has gained}} {{dominance}} in policy worldwide {{for more than}} one and a half decades. This paper explores the significance of place <b>in</b> <b>ageing,</b> <b>in</b> particular within the context of globalisation and immigration. In order to promote the value and participation of older ethnic people in communities, the New Zealand Government has acknowledged cultural diversity <b>in</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place policies. However, the concept of <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place is based predominantly on middle-class and Euro-centric values. The policies based on such understandings may not be as applicable to the ethnic Chinese. Moreover, <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place policies sometimes simply appear to ignore the fact that cultural norms (such as parent-child co-residence in the filial piety practice) may have changed when the migrant is affected by acculturation processes in a Western cultural context. These issues indicate that more culturally attuned research is needed about <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place among older Chinese immigrants. Using a Chinese case study conducted in New Zealand, the present research is designed to explore older Chinese migrants’ experiences of <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place. This paper answers the following research questions: 1) why did the participants immigrate to New Zealand; 2) were they relatively permanently settled; 3) why they moved; and 4) what are their current living arrangements...|$|R
