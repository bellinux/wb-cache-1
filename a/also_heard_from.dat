25|$|Oliphant {{took the}} Frisch–Peierls {{memorandum}} to Tizard in March 1940. He {{passed it on}} Thomson, who discussed it with Cockroft and Oliphant. They <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Jacques Allier of the French Deuxieme Bureau, who {{had been involved in}} the removal of the entire stock of heavy water from Norway. He told them of the interest the Germans had shown in the heavy water, and in the activity of the French researchers in Paris. Immediate action was taken: the Ministry of Economic Warfare was asked to secure stocks of uranium oxide in danger of being captured by the Germans; British intelligence agencies were asked to investigate the activities of German nuclear scientists; and A. V. Hill, the British Scientific Attaché in Washington, was asked {{to find out what the}} Americans were up to. Hill reported that the Americans had scientists investigating the matter, but they did not think that any military applications were in prospect.|$|E
500|$|In a 1957 interview, Fellini {{reported}} that Masina had received {{over a thousand}} letters from abandoned women whose husbands had returned to them after seeing the film {{and that she had}} <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> many people with disabilities who had gained a new sense of self-worth after viewing the film: [...] "Such letters {{come from all over the}} world".|$|E
500|$|Having {{described}} [...] the shooting, Gibbs {{dismissed the}} possibility of insanity, maintaining that Bellingham was, {{at the time of}} the deed, fully in control of his actions. Numerous eyewitnesses testified to what they had seen in the Commons lobby. The court <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> a tailor who, shortly before the attack had, on Bellingham's instructions, modified the latter's coat by adding a special inside pocket, in which Bellingham had concealed his pistols.|$|E
50|$|A {{wheezing}} veht call can {{be given}} by the male. Series of hoarse vrah-vrah-vrah calls can <b>also</b> be <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> females.|$|R
50|$|The court <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> appeals <b>from</b> {{consular}} {{courts in}} China, Japan and Korea {{and from the}} British Court for Japan which was established in 1879.|$|R
5000|$|Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers: {{beginning}} credits {{contain the}} Anvil song [...] "Straight Between the Eyes" [...] playing, and [...] "Wild Eyes" [...] is <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> (both <b>from</b> their Strength of Steel album).|$|R
500|$|In November 1997, {{the band}} found itself {{the target of}} congressional hearings, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman and Representative Sam Brownback, to {{determine}} the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. This hearing was held by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and was titled [...] "Music Violence: How Does It Affect Our Children". At this subcommittee, Lieberman once again criticized the band's music, calling it [...] "vile, hateful, nihilistic and damaging", and repeated his request that Seagram—then-owner of MCA—"start (...) disassociating itself from Marilyn Manson." [...] Lieberman {{would go on to}} refer to the band as [...] "perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company." [...] The subcommittee <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Raymond Kuntz, of Burlington, North Dakota, who blamed his son Richard's suicide on Antichrist Superstar—specifically the song [...] "The Reflecting God".|$|E
500|$|On 6May more {{witnesses}} for {{the prosecution}} were called. [...] As Squires and her family watched, several of Wells's neighbours insisted they had, about the beginning of 1753, seen the old gypsy in the area. [...] More witnesses claimed to have seen her in various places around Enfield Wash, including one woman who swore she had seen her on Old Christmas Day. [...] Britain's calendar had in September 1752 changed from the old-style Julian calendar, to the Gregorian calendar, and the woman was unable to discern the exact day on which she claimed to have seen Squires. [...] She was not alone; several of the defence's witnesses were also unable to manage the 11-day correction required by the calendar change. [...] Others were illiterate, and struggled similarly. [...] The court <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> three witnesses present solely to discredit the testimony offered by the Natuses.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion of}} {{spontaneous}} fission {{had been raised}} by Niels Bohr and John Archibald Wheeler in their 1939 treatment of the mechanism of nuclear fission. The first [...] attempt [...] to [...] discover [...] spontaneous fission in [...] uranium [...] was made [...] by Willard Libby, but he failed to detect it. It had been observed in Britain by Frisch and Titterton, and independently in the Soviet Union by Georgy Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak in 1940; the latter are generally credited with the discovery. Compton had <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the French physicist Pierre Auger that Frédéric Joliot-Curie had detected {{what might have been}} spontaneous fission in polonium. If true, it might preclude the use of polonium in the neutron initiators; if true for plutonium, it might mean that the gun-type design would not work. The consensus at the Los Alamos Laboratory was that it was not true, and that Joliot-Curie's results had been distorted by impurities.|$|E
50|$|Lester could <b>also</b> be <b>heard,</b> <b>from</b> April 2017 to June 2017 on Thames Radio's {{overnight}} shift. It {{is believed}} that the voice parts were 'Tracked' (recorded in advance and inserted between the records in real time).|$|R
5000|$|The album {{version is}} a melancholic piano ballad, {{featuring}} drums, synthesizers, an extended outro, along with Rice-Oxley's electric piano. In the extended outro, distortion piano notes can <b>also</b> be <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> lead singer Tom Chaplin's Yamaha CP60M.|$|R
50|$|English prison chaplains <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> confessions <b>from</b> {{condemned}} prisons, some {{of which}} were published - for example, the 18th century Ordinary of Newgate's Account. Such accounts presented the prisoners as coming to terms with their guilt and preparing for salvation.|$|R
500|$|Parsons and Moore {{devised a}} method of communication; one knock for yes, two knocks for no. [...] Using this system, the ghost {{appeared}} to claim that Fanny had been murdered. [...] It was conjectured that the mysterious figure in white which so terrified James Franzen, presumed to be the ghost of Elizabeth, had appeared there to warn her sister of her impending death. [...] As the first ghost had seemingly vanished, this charge against Kent—that he murdered Elizabeth—was never acted on, but through repeated questioning of Fanny's ghost it was divined that she had died not {{from the effects of}} smallpox, but rather from arsenic poisoning. [...] The deadly toxin had apparently been administered by Kent about two hours before Fanny died and now, it was supposed, her spirit wanted justice. [...] Moore had heard from Parsons how Kent had pursued the debt he was owed, and he had <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Ann Lynes, who had complained that as Fanny's coffin lid was screwed down she {{had not been able to}} see her sister's corpse. [...] Moore thought that Fanny's body might not show any visible signs of smallpox and that if she had been poisoned, the lack of scarring would have been something Kent would rather keep hidden. [...] As a clergyman with inclinations toward Methodism he was inclined to trust the ghost, but for added support he enlisted the aid of Thomas Broughton, an early Methodist. [...] Broughton visited Cock Lane on 5January and left convinced the ghost was real. [...] The story spread through London, The Public Ledger began to publish detailed accounts of the phenomenon, and Kent fell under public suspicion as a murderer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{public inquiry}} opened at Ayr on 28 March 1955 with {{questions}} about {{the operation of the}} air brake switch and any possible effect a failure may have caused. On the second day evidence was taken from air traffic controllers who agreed that the aircraft had descended on the runway more rapidly than usual, the inquiry <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> a pilot of an aircraft that landed before the Stratocruiser about the condition of the airfield and approach lighting.|$|E
2500|$|Gandin {{finally agreed}} to {{withdraw}} his soldiers from their strategic location on Mount Kardakata, the island's [...] "nerve centre", {{in return for a}} German promise not to bring reinforcements from the Greek mainland and on 12 September, he informed Barge that he was prepared to surrender the Acqui's weapons, as Lt Colonel Barge reported to his superiors in the XXII Mountain Corps. However, Gandin was under pressure not to come to an agreement with the Germans from his junior officers who were threatening mutiny. The Acqui's detached regiment on Corfu, not commanded by Gandin, also informed him at around midnight 12–13 September, by radio communication, that they had rejected an agreement with the Germans. Gandin <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> credible sources that soldiers who had surrendered were being deported and not repatriated.|$|E
50|$|A second {{hearing was}} {{arranged}} on 27 July 2006, and <b>heard</b> testimony <b>from</b> Mann, John Christy, a climate {{scientist at the}} University of Alabama in Huntsville, Ralph J. Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences, and Jay Gulledge of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. The hearing <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> testimony <b>from</b> Wegman and McIntyre.|$|R
50|$|Despite only serving three counties, KZZ73 has an {{extremely}} powerful transmitter, where the station {{can be heard}} across {{large areas of the}} Columbia Basin, Palouse and Blue Mountains. It can <b>also</b> be <b>heard</b> as far north as Wenatchee and Moses Lake; and as far west as Ryegrass Summit near Ellensburg. KZZ73 has <b>also</b> been <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Silverwood Theme Park in Kootenai County, ID.|$|R
50|$|It is {{normally}} heard across Northeast Oregon and South Central Washington. WXL95 can <b>also</b> be <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> {{as far north}} as Moses Lake and Ritzville and {{as far north as}} Steptoe Butte in Whitman County. It is heard along Interstate 90 between Moses Lake and Ritzville.|$|R
2500|$|Nine {{government}} {{witnesses were}} {{called by the}} prosecution. Army Captain Robert Snyder, John Threadcraft, a former army officer, and FBI agent John Jefferson testified first. As Snyder testified that Siddiqui had been arrested with a handwritten note outlining plans to attack various US sites, she interjected: [...] "Since I'll never {{get a chance to}} speak... If you were in a secret prison... or your children were tortured... Give me a little credit, this is not a list of targets against New York. I was never planning to bomb it. You're lying." [...] The court <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> FBI agent John Jefferson and Ahmed Gul, an army interpreter, who recounted their struggle with her. The judge disallowed as evidence her possession of chemicals and terror manuals and her alleged ties to al-Qaeda because they could have created an inappropriate bias.|$|E
2500|$|On July 12–13, 1927, {{following}} {{testimony by}} the defense firearms expert Albert H. Hamilton before the Committee, the Assistant District Attorney for Massachusetts, Dudley P. Ranney, {{took the opportunity to}} cross-examine Hamilton. He submitted affidavits questioning Hamilton's credentials as well as his performance during the New York trial of Charles Stielow, in which Hamilton's testimony linking rifling marks to a bullet used to kill the victim nearly sent an innocent man to the electric chair. [...] The Committee <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Braintree's police chief who told them he had found the cap on Pearl Street, allegedly dropped by Sacco during the crime, a full 24-hours after the getaway car had fled the scene. [...] The chief doubted the cap belonged to Sacco and called the whole trial a contest [...] "to see who could tell the biggest lies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ki barely {{played for}} Celtic {{in the first}} month of season 2010–11, but came off the bench to score his first {{competitive}} goal for Celtic on 22 August 2010 with a shot from 25 yards in a 4–0 victory against St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). By the end of October he had become a first team regular and was voted the SPL Young Player of the Month for October 2010. [...] However, on 30 October 2010, Ki found himself the recipient of apparent racist abuse during a league match away at St Johnstone. A section of the St Johnstone support were heard making barking noises – [...] "woofing" [...] – at Ki as he took a corner kick. Chants of [...] "Who ate all the dogs?" [...] were <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the home fans throughout the match.|$|E

50|$|Many left-wing {{political}} parties (Alliance of the Democratic Left, Labour Union, Social Democracy, Palikot's Movement and others) support {{the gay rights}} movement and are in favour of appropriate changes in legislation. Individual voices of support can <b>also</b> be <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the liberal right in the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska).|$|R
5000|$|Paul McCartney {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "(I Want to) Come Home" [...] {{for the film}} after seeing an advance screening. Though he wrote the song from the {{perspective}} of De Niro's character, afterwards, he realized it could <b>also</b> be <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the adult children's view. It led to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1996, Senator Joe Lieberman, {{along with}} former Secretary of Education William Bennett and Secretary of Pennsylvania State C. DeLores Tucker, {{held a press}} conference wherein they {{questioned}} MCA – the owner of Interscope – president Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s ability to head the label competently whilst profiting from [...] "profanity-laced" [...] albums by artists such as Tupac Shakur, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Marilyn Manson. The following November, Representative Sam Brownback chaired a hearing of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. At this subcommittee, Lieberman once again criticized the band's music, calling it [...] "vile, hateful, nihilistic and damaging", and repeated his request that Seagram – then-owner of MCA – [...] "start [...] disassociating itself from Marilyn Manson." [...] The subcommittee <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Raymond Kuntz, of Burlington, North Dakota, who blamed his son Richard's suicide on Antichrist Superstar–specifically the song [...] "The Reflecting God".|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him, no doubt,' resumed the secretary, after a moment's pause, 'that the rioters {{who have}} been taken (poor fellows) are {{committed}} for trial, and that some very active witnesses have had the temerity to appear against them. Among others--' and here he clenched his teeth, {{as if he would}} suppress by force some violent words that rose upon his tongue; and spoke very slowly. 'Among others, a gentleman who saw the work going on in Warwick Street; a Catholic gentleman; one Haredale.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It is not {{wonderful}} that the brethren made terms, for the [...] "Historie" [...] states that their force numbered but 1500 men, whereas d'Oysel and the Duke led twice that number, horse and foot. They <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Erskine, in the Castle, that, {{if they did}} not accept [...] "such appointment as they might have," [...] he [...] "would declare himself their enemy," [...] as he had promised the Regent. It seems that she did not want war, for d'Oysel's French alone {{should have been able to}} rout the depleted ranks of the Congregation.|$|E
50|$|Though {{disapproved of}} by many, pronunciations ending in \-kyə-lər\ {{have been found}} in {{widespread}} use among educated speakers, including scientists, lawyers, professors, congressmen, United States cabinet members, and at least two United States presidents and one vice president. While most common in the United States, these pronunciations have <b>also</b> been <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> British and Canadian speakers.|$|R
5000|$|MGM Resorts International {{senior vice}} {{president}} Mr. Alan Feldman, has said:“We have <b>heard</b> negative feedback <b>from</b> guests, but we’ve <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> positive feedback, <b>from</b> guests who are happy that {{they are no longer}} paying à la carte for different services.

5000|$|The Committee <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> {{testimony}} <b>from</b> Tracy Ryan, the Vice Chair of the Hawaii Libertarian Party, {{who said}} that Roger Christie {{was the victim of}} a [...] "frightening", [...] "railroading system" [...] in which federal prosecutors have provided [...] "a lot of good lawyerly reasons... to... say that the constitution of the United States doesn't apply to the federal system." ...|$|R
60|$|John Girdlestone had {{frequently}} {{heard his}} son {{speak of the}} major {{in the days when}} they had been intimate, and had always attributed some of the young man's more obvious vices to the effects of this ungodly companionship. He had <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Ezra a mangled version of the interview and quarrel in the private room of Nelson's Restaurant. Hence, as may be imagined, his feelings towards his visitor were far from friendly, and he greeted him as he entered with the coldest of possible bows. The major, however, was by no means abashed by this chilling reception, but stumped forward with beaming face and his pudgy hand outstretched, so that the other had no alternative but to shake it, which he did very gingerly and reluctantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Wulf of Steyning, my lord king," [...] Harold said, [...] "the {{youth who}} was unfortunate enough to incur your royal displeasure a year since, {{and who has}} upon your order {{returned}} from his estates. I have had excellent accounts of him from my good friend the prior of Bramber, who speaks well alike of his love of study and {{his attention to the}} affairs of his estate. I have <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> other hands of his progress in military exercises, and that he bids fair to become a valiant and skilful soldier of your majesty. He has prayed me to express his thanks to your majesty for having pardoned him, and having authorized me to enrol him again in the ranks of my followers here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has heard}} from him, I believe," [...] said the Major, [...] "and she has <b>also</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> your uncle the vicar. Our {{excellent}} Starkweather has written to her--to what purpose I {{have not been}} informed. I only know that on receipt of his letter she has decided on paying you a visit. I met the old lady last night at a party, and I tried hard to discover whether she were coming to you as your friend or your enemy. My powers of persuasion were completely thrown away on her. The fact is," [...] said the Major, speaking {{in the character of}} a youth of five-and-twenty making a modest confession, [...] "I don't get on well with old women. Take the will for the deed, my sweet friend. I have tried to be of some use to you and have failed." ...|$|E

5000|$|Criticism of {{sustainable}} or [...] "green MBAs" [...] has <b>also</b> been <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> environmentalists and social activists.

Some complain that the programs themselves are not sustainable enough, pointing to weaknesses in their curriculum and core proposition.|$|R
