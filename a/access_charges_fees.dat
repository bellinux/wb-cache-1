50|$|Under deregulation, many {{vertically}} integrated utilities {{were separated}} into generation owners, {{transmission and distribution}} owners, and retail providers. In order to recover capital costs, operating costs, and earn a return on investment, a transmission revenue requirement (TRR) is established {{and approved by the}} Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for each transmission owner. The TRR is paid through transmission <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> (TACs), load-weighted <b>fees</b> <b>charged</b> to internal load and energy exports for use of the transmission facilities. The energy export fee {{is often referred to as}} a wheeling charge. When wheeling-through, the transmission <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> only applies to the exported amount.|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{attempts}} have been made to run shuttles between the Port of Melbourne and inland ports. Between 2003 and 2006 CRT Group operated a shuttle to their terminal at Altona, 22 kilometers from the docks. In 2004/05, the service transported 13,000 TEU, this being 42 per cent capacity for import and 58 per cent for export containers. The service ceased due to high <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> <b>charged</b> by track operator ARTC, and delays by interstate freight trains sharing the same track making the reliable operation of two trips per day impossible. The service restarted in 2005, but failed for the same reasons. A second port shuttle has operated to the Austrack terminal at Somerton during various periods since 1998, with difficulties faced including inefficient track layouts, high rail transfer charges at the port, and inconvenient timetables dictated by long distance freight services.|$|R

40|$|Market {{structure}} and the incentive to invest in telecommunication infrastructure This paper addresses {{the question of how}} the competitive situation in a downstream market, the services, influences the innovative activity in an upstream market, the network infrastructure. To attend to the two-level-structure of the market presented above, the structure of the model follows models from the patent licensing literature. To adapt to the telecommunication sector this paper considers an integrated network provider that developed a new technology which reduces the production costs of the service providers. To permit the service providers to use the technology he can <b>charge</b> an <b>access</b> <b>fee.</b> It can be shown that the network provider’s profit increases with the number of competitors given the <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> is sufficiently high. The effect persists even if the <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> is set lower than the network supplier would set it. Hence it exists a range of the <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> where increasing competition in the service market yields more innovative investment in the network infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Information {{specialists in}} {{enterprises}} regularly use distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems that query {{a large number}} of information retrieval (IR) systems, merge the retrieved results, and display them to users. There can be considerable heterogeneity in the quality of results returned by different IR servers. Further, because different servers handle collections of different sizes and have different processing and bandwidth capacities, there can be considerable heterogeneity in their response times. The broker in the DIR system has to decide which servers to query, how long to wait for responses, and which retrieved results to display based on the benefits and costs imposed on users. The benefit of querying more servers and waiting longer is the ability to retrieve more documents. The costs may be in the form of <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> <b>charged</b> by IR servers or user’s cost associated with waiting for the servers to respond. We formulate the broker’s decision problem as a stochastic mixed-integer program and present analytical solutions for the problem. Using data gathered from FedStats—a system that queries IR engines of several U. S. federal agencies—we demonstrate that the technique can significantly increase the utility from DIR systems. Finally, simulations suggest that the technique can be applied to solve the broker’s decision problem under more complex decision environments...|$|R
