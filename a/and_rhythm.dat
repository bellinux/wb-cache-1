Focusing on lifestyle rock climbers (a particular type of lifestyle mobility dedicated {{to the pursuit of}} climbing) and events provides evidence for the ways informational and physical mobilities contribute to and even regiment rock climbing travel rhythms, while the everyday rhythms of place illustrate embodiment as crucial to the enfolding of <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> mobilities. Building from Lefebvre’s theory of <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> Edensor and Holloway’s (2008) re-articulation of its potential for mobilities studies, this paper emphasizes the ongoing relationality of embodied mobilities <b>and</b> bodily <b>rhythms,</b> seasonal <b>rhythms</b> <b>and</b> informational mobilities, collective mobilities <b>and</b> institutional <b>rhythms...</b>|$|R
