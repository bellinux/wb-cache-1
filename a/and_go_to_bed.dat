5|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{she would take}} a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at 10pm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two cups of tea, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at midnight.|$|E
25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E

25|$|Hannibal made careful {{preparations}} {{to break}} out of the trap, but not through a pitched battle as the Romans had hoped. The day before Hannibal put his plan in motion, he had most of his men eat a hearty supper <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early while leaving the campfires burning. 2,000 oxen from the captured herds were selected, along with 2,000 camp followers to drive the cattle and 2,000 spearmen to guard the whole gang, cattle and all. Dry wood and fagots were tied on the horns of the oxen. An officer called Hasdrubal, in charge of army supplies as his role as Quarter master general (the same who would later lead the heavy cavalry at Cannae), oversaw the whole operation. Once the preparations were complete, this group was to move towards the pass being guarded by 4,000 Romans. However, combat with the Romans or capturing the pass was not to be their objective. There was a saddle below the camp of Fabius to the east, and on the north west of the pass, at the foot of Mount Callicula. The Carthaginian spearmen were to capture and hold the saddle. There is a story recorded by Appian (Roman History 7.3.14) that Hannibal executed 5,000 prisoners so that they would not cause trouble before the march, an incident which is not mentioned by either Polybius or Livy.|$|E

2500|$|Ivan {{attempts}} {{to pick her}} up, but she proves immune to his charms. When he shows up at her building (without her giving him the address), she lets him into her apartment, so that her companion Rish, an athletic woman with bright blue skin, can shoot him with a stunner. They tie Ivan to a chair {{in their living room}} <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] When the apartment is broken into by two men, Ivan manages to alert the women, who stun the intruders. [...] Since the apartment is now clearly compromised, Ivan offers his flat as a refuge. [...] The two women reluctantly consent.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] {{act as the}} character's libido. Yamada's Eros Deity {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of a super deformed version of Yamada, but she has a white mustache, and floats on a pink cloud. She occasionally narrates and recaps past events as well as breaks the fourth wall to address the audience. She is voiced by Rumi Shishido and English dubbed by Alexis Tipton. Eros Deities are also depicted for the other characters: Kosuda's Eros Deity wears a bathrobe, has a laid back attitude, and gives ineffective advice such as telling Kosuda to give up <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> but in the anime he more often stands in whenever Kosuda has an erection; Mayu's Eros Deity is dressed like a magical girl and gives innocent love advice such as suggesting that Mayu [...] "indirectly kiss" [...] Takashi with her cookies; Kyoka's Eros Deity is a noblewoman with a fan; Miharu has two deities to represent her serious and her wild side; Chika's Eros Deity appears like a motion blur which indicates they are in sync with each other.|$|E
2500|$|The racquetball {{court is}} {{reminiscent}} of an old country club, furnished in dark leather and a functional bar. There is a sunken sitting area with the ever-present stereo system found throughout Graceland, {{as well as the}} dark brown upright piano upon which Elvis played for what were to be his last songs, Willie Nelson's [...] "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" [...] and The Righteous Brothers' [...] "Unchained Melody". Reports conflict about which one was the last song. The sitting area has a floor-to-ceiling shatterproof window designed to watch the many racquetball games that took place here when Elvis was alive. In {{the early hours of the}} morning Elvis died he, his girlfriend Ginger Alden, his first cousin Billy Smith and Billy's wife Jo played a game of racquetball ending the game with the song on the piano before Elvis walked into the main house to wash his hair <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> Today the two story court has been restored to the way it was when Elvis used the building.|$|E
