The immediate landscape by the roadside also includes the occasional small tract of farmland at several points. There is a crossing over the Genoa River within the forest, and the road roughly follows it upstream. Upon exiting the large forested area that exists near the border, the road enters farmland.

50|$|The {{geography}} of the bight has long been of major concern to meteorologists {{in the study of}} tropical storm patterns along the east coast, {{and is one of the}} primary reasons why the New York Metropolitan Area is considered a high danger zone for storm generated ocean-water surges, despite its northerly latitude. Specifically, in the presence of a hurricane off the coast of New Jersey, the easterly cyclonic winds along the northern edge of the storm could drive a strong surge to the west, laterally along the southern coast of Long Island and straight into Lower New York Bay. The <b>angle</b> <b>bend</b> of the New Jersey coast would leave little outlet for the surge, leading to widespread flooding throughout New York City, especially along the southern coast of Staten Island and Manhattan.|$|E

Initially three-dimensional nonlinear thermo-mechanical FEM based numerical model is developed for computation of <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> for given process conditions. The absorptivity used in the numerical model was then tuned by using inverse analysis technique. In this technique, FEM simulations were repeated by varying the values of absorptivity. The value of absorptivity for each set of process condition was estimated by comparing the <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> obtained in the numerical and experimental studies so that the computational error of <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> is less than 5  %.
