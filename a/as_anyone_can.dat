He’s noted on several occasions that he’s taken the strategies of the major sports brands, i.e. NASCAR, the NBA, and the NFL, and extracted the best practices to grow the WSOP. He has asserted, moreover, that “ports marketing fundamentally is about the selling of hope.

500|$|Minnie Island State Park is a pine grown-knoll that {{is located}} in the deepest portion of the lake. It is an unmarked and undeveloped island that also is Connecticut's {{smallest}} state park at 0.88 acres. The island acquired its name when a local man declared it to be Minnie Island, because he took his wife, Minnie, to it for picnics. Joseph Leary, author of A Shared Landscape writes, [...] "s far back <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> remember, the island was a frequent landing place for boating parties and a great place for local children to explore." [...] The island was claimed by both the towns of Salem, Connecticut and Montville, Connecticut though it was not in the land records of either town. This went unnoticed until a man attempted to purchase the island, and then made attempted to establish claim to the island. The man introduced a bill to authorize the sale by the state to establish title to the island, but instead the Connecticut General Assembly drafted and passed a bill to turn the island into a park.|$|E
500|$|From an {{academic}} perspective, Marx's work {{contributed to the}} birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the nineteenth century's three masters of the [...] "school of suspicion" [...] alongside Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud and as one of the three principal architects of modern social science along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber. In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method. Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean sociological positivism in attempt to develop a science of society. Karl Löwith considered Marx and Søren Kierkegaard to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors. In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. Isaiah Berlin considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology [...] "in so far <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> claim the title". Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts and the humanities.William Roseberry (1997) Marx and Anthropology Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 26: pp. 25–46 (October 1997) ...|$|E

Nevertheless, despite their benefits and popularity, completion levels are low, which can be attributed to the openness of the environment.

500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the achievements of}} Scott and Amundsen, most polar historians generally accept that Amundsen's skills with ski and dogs, his general familiarity with ice conditions, and his clear focus on a non-scientific expedition gave him considerable advantages {{in the race for}} the Pole. Scott's verdict on the disaster that overtook his party, written when he was close to death, lists the initial loss of pony transport, weather conditions, [...] "a shortage of fuel in our depots for which I cannot account", and the sickening of Evans and Oates, but ultimately Scott concludes that [...] "our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather [...] on the Barrier [...] in the day, [...] at night". Presumably with regard to the failed rendez-vous with the dog teams requested for 1 March 1912, Scott furthermore wrote [...] "No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we have lacked support". Cherry-Garrard, whom Atkinson placed in charge of the dog teams which started late, failed to meet Scott and turned for home, observes that [...] "the whole business simply bristles with 'ifs'"; an accumulation of decisions and circumstances that might have fallen differently ultimately led to catastrophe.

However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence - what Sartre would call 'bad faith'.

For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Furthermore, by this action of cruelty, such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is as opposed to their genes, or human nature, bearing the blame.|$|R
