40|$|The {{challenge}} of ballistic missiles classification is getting greater importance in last years. In fact, since the <b>antimissile</b> <b>defence</b> systems have generally {{a limited number}} of interceptors, it is important to distinguish between warheads and confusing objects that the missile releases during its flight, in order to maximize the interception success ratio. For this aim, a novel micro-Doppler based classification technique is presented in this paper characterized by the employment of Krawtchouk moments. Since the evaluation of the latter requires a low computational time, the proposed approach is suitable for real time applications. Finally, a comparison with the 2 -dimensional Gabor filter based approach is described by testing both the techniques on real radar data...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Nanobacteria (calcifying nanoparticles, nanobes) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues in contemporary biology. Studies show accumulating evidence on association of nanobacteria with oral pathologic calcifications such as calculus, pulp stone, and salivary gland stones. The Hypothesis: Experiments have shown that nanobacteria are excreted from the body in urine and saliva, lifted from the ground by winds into the cloud, and transit between the high humidity region of the clouds and the relatively dry inter-cloud regions. Remnants of a sticky protein coating that nanobacteria make it act as an extremely efficient cloud condensation nuclei. Following condensation of cloud, nanobacteria return to the earth via rain and snow. Evaluation of the Hypothesis: Transmission of nanobacteria via clouds is not surprising when compared with cosmic transmission of nanobacteria. The apatite mineral layer around the organism serves as a primary <b>defence</b> <b>shield</b> against various seriously life-threatening conditions. A double defence with the apatite layer and an impermeable membrane combined with a very slow metabolism is a likely explanation for the resistance of nanobacteria...|$|R

Moreover, as an unfortunate but perhaps inescapable hidden cost of its emergence as the region’s premier free port, for many years the UAE’s second wealthiest emirate of Dubai has attracted the attention of both international criminal and terrorist organisations, many of which have exploited the emirate’s laissez-faire attitudes and impressive physical infrastructure to set up various smuggling, gun-running, human-trafficking, and money-laundering operations.
