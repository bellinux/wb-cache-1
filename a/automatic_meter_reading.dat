The traditional data collection process is still common in developing countries despite the inherent inefficiency, inaccuracy and labour intensity.

40|$|A fast {{shift is}} taking place in Sweden and in other {{countries}} from manual <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> at irregular intervals, to <b>automatic</b> remote <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> at pre-defined instants. Remote <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> {{is an essential part of}} a well-functioning electricity market, but the transmission of large numbers of readings (millions for some network operators) poses serious technical challenges. Different communication channels have been tried, but the power grid is the one that is in any case always available at places where electricity has to be metered. The power grid is however not designed as a communication channel; high disturbance levels and attenuation may occur. The main concern is the as yet unpredictable character of both disturbance and attenuation. The widespread use of the power grid as a communication channel (as will likely be the case with remote <b>meter</b> <b>reading)</b> may also lead to interference with other equipment. This paper will give a general overview of the potential problems associated with remote-meter reading via the power grid and describe some of the technologies available.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a novel method for <b>automatic</b> gas <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> from real world images. In {{a wide range}} of {{countries}} all over the world, the existing automatic technology is not adopted, usually the reading is manually done on site, and a picture is taken through a mobile device as a proof of reading. In order to confirm the reading, a tedious work of checking the proof images is commonly done offline by an operator. With this contribution we aim to supply an effective system, able to provide a real support to the validation process reducing the human effort and the time consumed. We exploit both region-based and Maximally Stable Extremal Regions techniques, during the phase involving the localization of the meter area and to detect the meter counter digits in the detection step respectively. The evaluation has been carried out on every step of our approach, {{as well as on the}} overall assessment; although the problem is complex, the proposed method leads to good results even when applied to degraded images, it represents an effective solution to the gas <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> problem and it can be utilized in real applications...|$|R

40|$|In Sweden, {{the change}} from manual <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> at {{irregular}} intervals, to <b>automatic</b> remote <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> at predefined instants was completed in July 2009. This change is ongoing or largely completed {{in a number of}} other European countries as well. Several methods for communication between the meter and the network operator are in use. In Sweden power-line communication is used for communication with about half of the meters. The frequency range between 9 and 95 kHz contains, in addition to communication signals, conducted emission from end-user equipment connected to the power grid. Electronic components in end-user equipment can also in other ways affect the characteristic of the power lines as a communication media. The aim of this thesis is to give an overview of how power line communication in the frequency range 9 to 95 kHz can interact with modern energy saving end-user equipment. Potential problems concerning this interaction have been identified. Results presented in this thesis are based on a large number of measurements of voltage and current distortions due to connected loads and due to power line communication. A total of five different ways of interaction between power-line communication and end-user equipment are identified in this thesis. As a spin-off from this work, also new aspects of the interaction between end-user equipment have been identified.

The aim of this project {{is to develop a}} smart power management system using wireless sensor network. The system is developed by using an unlicensed radio frequency (RF) band where communication takes place between the main controller unit and sensor nodes on the basis of current consumption at every node. Each sensor node will sense current consumption of a dedicated device assigned to it. Data acquisition from the main controller is flexible to operate in round robin or interrupt service routine (ISR) manner. Power consumed by each device which is proportionate to the value measured by the sensor node will be calculated at the main controller and stored in a database within the main controller itself. As many sensor nodes can be placed as possible within the distance range of the main controller (40 meters indoor and 120 meters outdoor line-of-sight). Throughout this project, hardware and software development were done concurrently in order to optimize the time consumption. Validation and verification process includes calibration of current sensor used and experimenting current measurement of several electrical appliances, such as 240 V – 12 V transformer, electric kettle and hair dryer.
