5|$|Although Gillis was not {{exclusively}} used on Post covers, the Willie Gillis series of covers was {{a hallmark of}} Rockwell's wartime work. In Rockwell's prime and {{at the peak of}} its popularity, the Post had a subscribership of 4 million, and many of these subscribers believed Gillis was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person.</b> Rockwell's wartime art, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter, contributed {{to the success of the}} wartime bond sales efforts.|$|E
5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person,</b> Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2013, Kat Stoeffel, for The Cut, {{argued that}} the term itself had become sexist, citing her opinion that [...] "it was levied, criminally at Diane Keaton in Annie Hall and Zooey Deschanel, the actual <b>person.</b> How could <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>persons</b> {{defining}} trait be a lack of interior life?" ...|$|R

5|$|Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{had become}} {{suspicious}} {{as to whether}} Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person.</b> Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that {{the owner of the}} phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} {{originally}} sold very slowly, {{it became a}} Publishers Weekly bestseller. The Fall of Reach {{would go on to}} sell more than 100,000 copies by 2003 and a million copies by December 2009. The novel's success convinced Microsoft and Del Ray to pen a three-novel publishing contract for novels based on Xbox games, including another Halo novel. The next entry in the Halo novel franchise would be 2003's , written by William C. Dietz. The more human Chief seen in the novel led Bungie to tone down the character model in Halo 2 to make him less an exaggerated robot and more <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person</b> inside a suit.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though this}} episode aired {{as the last}} episode of the first season, {{it was the first}} episode in {{production}} and was intended to be the first episode to air from the half-hour show. The series is a spin-off from The Tracey Ullman Show in which the family already appeared in a series of animated one-minute shorts. The characters were already created, but had to be further developed in order to carry a half-hour show. The episode was therefore meant as an introduction to the characters. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer/producer Sam Simon (of such television series as Cheers) wrote the script for the episode. Both Groening and Simon are credited with developing the series along with executive producer James L. Brooks. The name of Ms. Botz was based on <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person</b> that once babysat Groening.|$|E

5|$|Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, {{but others}} continued. From this point, {{they appear to}} have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle {{suggests}} was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person,</b> or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person</b> would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{explanation}} may be: This is {{the name}} of the author of the wise sayings provided in Prov. 30. Either this was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person,</b> or as some have suggested, it was a fanciful name for Solomon. Proverbs 30 says that he was the son of Jakeh (Hebrew: “Yaqeh”) which means “to obey” or “obedient.” Again, this is either <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person,</b> or another symbolic name for Solomon.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from Plato, {{is also important}} in Mazzoni’s work. Icastic imitation refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person</b> or {{the creation of a}} character based on <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person</b> is icastic imitation. Phantastic imitation is the imitation of something completely the artist’s imagination. This distinction would {{play an important role in}} Mazzoni’s On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante, in which he would argue that the work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic mimesis because it imitates something “real.” This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed Dante’s work as lacking in verisimilitude and even claimed that the comedy was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision. Under Mazzoni’s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially mimesis made “persuasive” by the use of craft or art.|$|E
25|$|By association, {{the word}} has also been used to mean any sort of {{recurring}} theme, (whether or not subject to developmental transformation) in literature, or (metaphorically) {{the life of a}} fictional character or <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>person.</b> It is sometimes also used in discussion of other musical genres, such as instrumental pieces, cinema, and video game music, sometimes interchangeably with the more general category of theme.|$|E
