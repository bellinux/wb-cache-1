5|$|Lions tend to {{dominate}} smaller felids such as African cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah {{in particular has}} a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators. Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, accounting for up to 78.2% of predator-killed juveniles in one study. Cheetahs avoid their competitors using different temporal (time) and spatial (habitat) niches. Leopards are able to take refuge in trees; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills. Similarly, lions dominate African wild dogs, not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) <b>adult</b> <b>dogs.</b> Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, {{there are a few}} reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs. African lions may also conflict with Nile crocodiles. Depending {{on the size of the}} crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land, while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways, as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.|$|E
25|$|Urinary incontinence* is leakage of urine, usually due to {{incompetence}} of the urethral sphincter in <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> and ectopic ureter (a congenital {{condition in}} which the ureter enters the urinary tract posterior to the urethral sphincter) in puppies. In <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> it is most commonly seen in large spayed females. The lack of estrogens in spayed dogs {{has been linked to}} development of incontinence. Replacement of estrogens, phenylpropanolamine, and surgery have all been used for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Mega{{esophagus}} is {{a disease}} of the esophagus characterized by low motility and dilation. Most cases in <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> are idiopathic.

25|$|Hemorrhagic {{gastroenteritis}} is {{a disease}} of dogs characterized by sudden vomiting and bloody diarrhea. The symptoms are usually severe and can be fatal if not treated. It is most common in young <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> of any breed, but especially small dogs such as the Toy Poodle and Miniature Schnauzer.|$|E
25|$|The skull is {{flat and}} broad {{with a slight}} stop. The backskull and muzzle are {{approximately}} equal in length; the backskull is approximately twice {{the width of the}} muzzle. The muzzle is large, blunt and straight, and most often has a slight rise before the end. In <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> the nose leather is always black.|$|E
25|$|The Boxer {{by nature}} {{is not an}} {{aggressive}} or vicious breed. It is an instinctive guardian and can become very attached to its family. Like all dogs, it requires proper socialization. Boxers are generally patient with smaller dogs and puppies, but difficulties with larger <b>adult</b> <b>dogs,</b> especially those of the same sex, may occur. Boxers are generally more comfortable with companionship, in either human or canine form.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Inuit {{would put}} their dogs to the harness {{as soon as}} they could walk, and would acquire the habit of pulling sledges in their {{attempts}} to break free. At the age of two months, the pups would be placed with <b>adult</b> <b>dogs.</b> Sometimes, ten pups would be put under the lead of an older animal, coupled with frequent beatings from their masters, which would educate the pups.|$|E
25|$|Raw bones fed to dogs contain high {{amounts of}} calcium and {{phosphorus}} {{that is essential}} for neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine and clotting function. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus for <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> should be 1:1. Compared to commercial dog food, the raw food diet allows dogs to work for their meal, ripping the meat off bones and then gnawing at the bones. In regards to dental health, bone to tooth gnawing allows a dog to rid their teeth of plaque buildup promoting good oral health. Skeptics argue however that this isn't healthy for dogs and it can cause dental fractures.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two forms}} of CPV2: {{intestinal}} and cardiac. Puppies are most susceptible, but more than 80 percent of <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> show no symptoms. With severe disease, dogs can die within 48 to 72 hours without treatment by fluids. In the more common, less severe form, mortality is about 10 percent. Certain breeds, such as Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, and Pit bull terriers {{as well as other}} black and tan colored dogs may be more susceptible to CPV2. Along with age and breed, factors such as a stressful environment, concurrent infections with bacteria, parasites, and canine coronavirus increase a dog's risk of severe infection. Dogs who catch Parvovirus usually die from the dehydration it causes or secondary infection rather than the virus itself.|$|E

2500|$|While a {{distinct}} {{reason for the}} difference is unknown, a strong hypothesis is that the vocal communication of dogs developed due to their domestication. As evidenced by the farm-fox experiment, the process of domestication alters a breed {{in more ways than}} just tameness. [...] Domesticated breeds show vast physical differences from their wild counterparts, notably an evolution that suggests neoteny, or the retention of juvenile characteristics in adults. [...] <b>Adult</b> <b>dogs</b> have, for example, large heads, floppy ears, and shortened snouts – all characteristics seen in wolf puppies. [...] The behavior, too, of <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> shows puppy-like characteristics: dogs are submissive, they whine, and they frequently bark. The experiment illustrates how selecting for one trait (in this case, tameness) can create profound by-products, both physical and behavioral.|$|E
2500|$|Dog barking is {{distinct}} from wolf barking. [...] Wolf barks represent only 2.3% of all wolf vocalizations [...] and are described as “rare” occurrences. [...] According to Schassburger, wolves bark only in warning, defense, and protest. In contrast, dogs bark {{in a wide variety}} of social situations, with acoustic communication in dogs being described as hypertrophic. [...] Additionally, while wolf barks tend to be brief and isolated, <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> bark in long, rhythmic stanzas. Dogs have been known to bark for hours on end.|$|E

2500|$|Cats can {{be cured}} easily and lambs usually simply lose weight, but in calves, the parasites {{can be fatal}} and often are not {{responsive}} to antibiotics or electrolytes. Carriers among calves can also be asymptomatic. [...] This parasite is deadly for chinchillas, so extra {{care must be taken}} by providing them with safe water. [...] Dogs have a high infection rate, as 30% of the population under one year old are known to be infected in kennels. The infection is more prevalent in puppies than in <b>adult</b> <b>dogs.</b> Infected dogs can be isolated and treated, or the entire pack at a kennel can be treated together regardless. Kennels should also be then cleaned with bleach or other cleaning disinfectants. The grass areas used for exercise should be considered contaminated for at least one month after dogs show signs of infection, as cysts can survive in the environment for long periods of time. Prevention can be achieved by quarantine of infected dogs for at least 20 days and careful management and maintenance of a clean water supply.|$|E
2500|$|Dermoid sinus is a {{congenital}} neural-tube defect that {{is known}} to affect this breed. The dermoid is often likened to a thin [...] "spaghetti strand" [...] beneath the skin. Puppies should always be screened at birth by the breeder and veterinarian, and the examination repeated as the puppies grow before they go to their new homes. This is done by palpation of the subcutaneous dorsal midline {{from the base of}} the skull to the insertion of the tail. Surgical removal is an option for affected neonates, puppies and <b>adult</b> <b>dogs.</b> All affected dogs, even those surgically corrected, should be spayed or neutered and never be bred, since surgical dermoid sinus removal can be extremely cost prohibitive, and because many unremoved dermoid sinuses will eventually abscess. Abscessed dermoid sinuses will be at best a recurrent, painful problem, and if the sinus communicates with the tissues around the spinal cord, cause meningitis and often death. However, it has been shown that supplementation of folic acid to the diet of the brood bitch before mating and during pregnancy reduces the incidence of dermoid sinus. One study on the Swedish population estimates that 8-10% are affected. Slightly less than 5% of ridgebacks were reported to be affected with the condition in a US breed club survey.|$|E
2500|$|The virus first {{appears in}} {{bronchial}} lymph nodes and tonsils {{two days after}} exposure. [...] The virus then enters the blood stream on {{the second or third}} day. [...] A first round of acute fever tends to begin around three to eight days after infection, which is often accompanied by a low white blood cell count, especially of lymphocytes, as well as low platelet count. [...] These signs {{may or may not be}} accompanied by anorexia, a runny nose, and discharge from the eye. [...] This first round of fever typically recedes rapidly within 96 hours, and then a second round of fever begins around the 11th or 12th day and lasts at least a week. [...] Gastrointestinal and respiratory problems tend to follow, which may become complicated with secondary bacterial infections. [...] Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, otherwise known as encephalomyelitis, either is associated with this, subsequently follows, or comes completely independent of these problems. A thickening of the footpads sometimes develops, and vesicularpustular lesions on the abdomen usually develop. Neurological signs typically are found in the animals with thickened footpads from the virus. About half of sufferers experience meningoencephalitis. Less than 50% of the <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> that contract the disease die from it. Among puppies, the death rate often reaches 80%.|$|E
