5|$|In 1920, the University of Göttingen offered Max Born its {{chair of}} {{theoretical}} physics, which {{had recently been}} vacated by Peter Debye. Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski and Carl Runge, {{but not so much}} for physics. This would change. As part of his price for coming to Göttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured professor ordinarius. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought Hertha Sponer with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, <b>a</b> <b>gifted</b> teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures. Franck refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968–69 season, third-year defenceman Bobby Orr scored 21goals {{to set an}} NHL {{record for}} goals by a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight {{consecutive}} Norris Trophies as the league's top defenceman. At the same time, Orr's teammate, Phil Esposito, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126points. <b>A</b> <b>gifted</b> scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive part of the game, as blue-liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them. Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer, the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career; he played 12seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978. Orr finished with 270goals and 915points in 657games, and he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league Most Valuable Player thrice.|$|E

Johnson {{lived with his}} mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later <b>a</b> <b>gifted</b> public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.|$|E
5|$|Lander's Peak was an {{immediate}} success; twelve hundred people were invited for the exhibition, and almost a thousand showed up. Bierstadt was a shrewd self-promoter as well as <b>a</b> <b>gifted</b> artist, {{and this was the}} first of his paintings to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour. The painting, with its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class. In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for the (at the time) high price of $25,000. Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Led by Gretzky and Mark Messier, the Oilers {{won five}} Stanley Cup championships between 1984 and 1990. On August 9, 1988, Oilers owner Peter Pocklington, in {{financial}} trouble, traded Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings. Gretzky's trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States. With the Kings, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's {{record for the}} most career points. Mario Lemieux led Pittsburgh to Stanley Cups in 1990–91 and 1991–92. <b>A</b> <b>gifted</b> forward, he won six Art Ross Trophies as the league's leading scorer and he scored 199 points in 1988–89, becoming the second highest single-season point scorer behind Gretzky. Lemieux's career was plagued by health issues, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and he retired in 1997. In 2000, he returned and finished his NHL career in 2006 with more than 1,700 points.|$|E
