5|$|His {{studies had}} {{impressed}} the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, {{who was more}} <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity two years later); in 1669 Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of spectators}} had slept on wet {{pavements}} outside the stadium in rainy weather {{on the eve}} of the Test to queue for tickets. Bradman had announced his forthcoming retirement at the end of the season, so the public were <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> witness his last appearance at Test level.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Childe left Edinburgh {{to take up}} the {{position}} as Director and Professor of European Prehistory at the Institute of Archaeology (IOA) in London. <b>Anxious</b> <b>to</b> return to the capital, he had kept silent over his disapproval of government policies so {{that he would not be}} prevented from getting the job. He took up residence at Lawn Road Flats near to Hampstead.|$|E
60|$|Marco {{finding that}} Forester {{appeared}} somewhat <b>anxious,</b> began <b>to</b> feel some sentiment of fear himself.|$|R
60|$|It was {{observed}} that the other Eskimos drew near with <b>anxious</b> looks <b>to</b> hear the opinion of their chief.|$|R

5|$|Kusanagi {{follows the}} car {{carrying}} {{the body to}} an abandoned building. It is protected by a large walking tank. <b>Anxious</b> <b>to</b> face the Puppet Master's ghost, Kusanagi engages the tank without backup and is nearly killed. Her partner Batou arrives in time to save her, and helps connect her brain to the Puppet Master's.|$|E
5|$|Since January 1691 Marlborough {{had been}} in contact with the exiled JamesII in Saint-Germain, <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> obtain the {{erstwhile}} King's pardon for deserting him in 1688a pardon essential for the success of his future career in the not altogether unlikely event of a Jacobite restoration.|$|E
5|$|To {{compound}} {{the agony of}} his defeat, Adams' son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died in late November. <b>Anxious</b> <b>to</b> rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend Jefferson's inauguration. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successor's inauguration.|$|E
60|$|Waldo was by {{this time}} {{convinced}} that Van Tahn was raving mad, and made an <b>anxious</b> effort <b>to</b> humour him.|$|R
60|$|Most fruit-growers, I said, {{were dead}} against the birds, and <b>anxious</b> only <b>to</b> kill {{as many of}} them as possible.|$|R
60|$|Being <b>anxious,</b> however, <b>to</b> see his father, Bob cut the {{conversation}} short, and, having promised {{to visit his}} old enemy, hastened away.|$|R
5|$|After {{the match}} against Durham, Australia headed south to The Oval for the Fifth Test, which started on 14 August. Barnes and Tallon {{returned}} from injury, while Ernie Toshack was omitted with knee troubles, and the leg spin of Doug Ring replaced Johnson's off spin. Overnight, hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements in rainy weather to queue for tickets. Bradman had already {{announced that he}} would retire {{at the end of the}} season, and the public were <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> witness his last Test appearance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anxious</b> <b>to</b> {{protect the}} Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community {{to arrange a}} meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} many Christians {{performed}} daring feats to rescue captives from Seringapatnam {{and take them}} to places of safety. A captive named Domingo Pinto (brother of Salvador Pinto, who rose to high rank in the services of Tipu), was particularly proficient in this. He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money. He fixed the rescue price per captive at 8 hoons (Rs. 32) for a male, and 4 hoons (Rs. 16) for a female.|$|E

5|$|By March 1905, Potter was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> {{begin work}} on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|David’s good {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} 987 when he, <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> make his extensive possessions a hereditary Bagratid domain, joined his long-time friend Bardas Phokas in a {{rebellion against the}} emperor Basil. Once the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine-Rus' forces in 989, Basil dispatched a strong force under John of Chaldea to punish the Georgians, and David had to submit. Reconciled with the emperor, he was granted, in c. 990, the title of kuropalates again in return for his promise that upon his death the lands previously placed under his sovereignty would revert to the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Karl {{inspected}} Budapest on 19 November at Trieste. <b>Anxious</b> <b>to</b> revenge {{themselves against}} the Austro-Hungarians, the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) planned {{an attack on the}} two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia, near Trieste, by MAS boats. On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at Wien and Budapest. The torpedoes fired at the Budapest struck the mole of the seaplane station, but Wien was hit twice and capsized in five minutes, killing 46 of the crew.|$|E

5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate his policies and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> curtail the autonomy that his father had granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E
5|$|He was {{assigned}} to a civil flying school at RAF Prestwick which was run by Scottish Aviation Limited. He formally began his training on 29 June 1936. He progressed well in his theory examinations, gaining 99 percent for gunnery and 91 percent for airmanship. He flew a single-engined De Havilland Tiger Moth training biplane and gained his A Licence {{at the end of}} July, partly because he was a capable pilot and also because the Air Ministry was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> produce trained pilots. He completed his training within two months and was classified as above average after passing his examination with ease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally {{attribute the}} numbers {{given in the}} ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Not all, one suspects, were yielded willingly to Æthelwold's {{grasping}} representatives... Æthelwold obviously {{wanted his}} monasteries to be centres of spiritual power, an aim {{he sought to}} fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible. Undoubtedly too he was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
