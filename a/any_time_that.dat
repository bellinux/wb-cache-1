5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E

500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to rely on his right to remain silent, nor {{that he did not}} want to talk to the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequence—did he believe in God, did he pray to God, and did he pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction.|$|E

2500|$|The South {{argued that}} each state {{had the right}} to secede—leave the Union—at <b>any</b> <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> the Constitution was a [...] "compact" [...] or {{agreement}} among the states. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a perpetual union.

2500|$|Critics of sedevacantism argue {{this also}} means that the theory {{advanced}} by the seventeenth-century theologian and Doctor of the Church Robert Bellarmine that a pope who fell into heresy would automatically forfeit his office and could be formally deposed has been overruled by Church authority by Benedict XIV in [...] "De Synodo Dioecesana" [...] (10,1,5) and by the 1917 Code of Canon Law, Can. 2232, Par. 1, [...] "A penalty that is latae sententiae, whether medicinal or punitive, holds for one who is aware of his own delict in both fora but prior to a declaratory sentence, the delinquent is excused from observing the penalty <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he cannot observe it without infamy, and in the external forum no one can compel the observance of that penalty from him unless the delict is notorious, with due regard for Can. 2223, Par. 4." [...] Sedevacantist appeals to Bellarmine's authority in this point accordingly could not be sustained, adding that Bellarmine envisaged that such a deposition, even if possible, could only be undertaken by a significant body of the Church including many bishops and cardinals, rather than by a few individuals.|$|E

2500|$|In Jackson's series, Sauron is {{originally}} {{portrayed as}} a towering [...] "black knight" [...] wielding a huge black mace (reminiscent of Tolkien's descriptions as well as conceptual artist John Howe's illustrations of Morgoth); in this form, he is portrayed by Sala Baker. While Tolkien never specifically discussed the type of armour, Sauron is shown in spiky plate armour of very high quality: it has very ornate filigree but is also quite functional. In the DVD commentary, the production team explained their intent was to represent Sauron's great skill as a craftsman and ring-maker: [...] Sauron was originally a maia spirit in service to the smith-vala Aulë, and thus was very wise in the lore of physical construction. [...] Sauron may have fallen from his previously angelic state, but a shadow of his great skill in forging and construction remains, {{even though it has}} been twisted to making weapons of war. [...] Thus they chose to depict Sauron as wearing frightening, but very high quality and ornate armour of his own creation. Sauron's body disintegrates with explosive force after Isildur cuts off the Ring with the hilt-shard of the sword Narsil. Sauron's spiritual essence remained intact as it eventually consolidates into the Eye of Sauron by the time of Barad-dûr's restoration, stationing himself between the twin horn-like spires above the tower to scan Mordor like a searchlight. The effect in Mordor is seen as a red beam that moves across the land, forever probing. It also seems to be visible to Frodo (and to see him in turn) <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he is wearing the Ring. Pippin has a brief encounter with the Eye, after gazing into the palantír of Orthanc. In the extended edition of The Return of the King, Sauron's humanoid form appears when Aragorn looks into the palantír. When the Ring is destroyed, the Eye of Sauron collapses in on itself, causing a massive shock wave that destroys his entire kingdom.|$|E
