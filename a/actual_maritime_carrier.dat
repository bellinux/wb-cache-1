40|$|E-services are a {{relatively}} new development in the maritime industry when companies have started to use internet in the contact with the customers. The minimum standard that has developed is to not only give the customer the ability to find the <b>maritime</b> <b>carrier’s</b> schedules online {{but also for the}} customer to be able to track the status of their container using a so called track and trace. These functions are commonly found on a carrier’s own website as well as through online shipping networks. These e-services are linked to the regular customer service that is provided by company’s employees through documentation and booking desks. This study is important as it gives us a deeper understanding of how customers are impacted on by the quality of customer service. This study evaluates the impact of provided services towards the customers by answering the following research questions:  How does the quality of customer service affect the shippers’ choice of carrier?  How would the configuration of e-services affect the customer’s choice of shipping carrier?  What should be considered in the carrier’s establishment of an e-strategy to reach the customers’ expectations of e-services? The study was performed using qualitative interviews with customers within the shipping business. The results of the study show that the quality of customer service has an impact on the choice of carrier but also on further business agreements. It is important for the customer to get a high level of service with emphasis on time of response, availability and correct information. The study has also shown that customers value the attitude of the <b>maritime</b> <b>carrier’s</b> customer service employees as it affects the relationship. Customers want to have access to e-services that facilitate their daily work, and functions as track and trace and schedules online. Other e-service functions of significance are that they will not make the work more time consuming or complicated.

50|$|The {{standard}} CGT {{system was}} developed in 1977 by the OECD so that inter-country shipbuilding output could be reasonably compared, as different types of ships require {{a greater or lesser}} degree of work relative to their gross tonnage. For example, passenger ferry of a given size would require substantially more work to build than a bulk carrier of the same size due to the differing design requirements, internal structure, and required level of detail, but simply comparing the gross tonnage or deadweight of each ship would incorrectly show that they took the same amount of work. When expanded on a national scale, this difference could greatly mislead people as to the <b>actual</b> <b>maritime</b> production capacity of a given country.|$|R
30|$|Structural optimization, {{especially}} topology optimization, {{is being}} used increasingly in aerospace vehicles, <b>maritime</b> <b>carriers,</b> wind turbine blades, and various mechanical equipment where high strength, high stiffness, and low weight are important. In such applications, the problem of selecting a suitable optimization model has been investigated for a long time. In the vast literature on structural optimization model, arguably the two most studied problems are stress-constrained weight minimization and material volume-constrained compliance minimization. Indeed, Cox (1965) succeeded to prove that results attained via compliance minimization model would be equivalent to Michell's truss (stress-constrained weight minimization result) in 1965.It has been shown {{a long time ago}} that these seemingly different problems possess equal optimal topologies (result), when the truss is subject to a single loading condition and the allowable stresses in tension and compression are equal (Dorn et al. 1964; Hemp 1973). This result has been extended by Achtziger (1996) for cases where the allowable stresses in tension and compression are not equal.|$|R

30|$|The {{points in}} Fig.  2 {{represent}} {{data from a}} typical Drewry’s study of days late for a maritime ship service, the longest transit time for any agent in the supply chain. A normal with mean 0.06 and standard deviation 0.086 has a 95 % quantile at 0.208  days. The Drewry’s data exhibit more long late delays and more slightly early arrivals than the normal distribution. The 95 th percentile of the real data is about 5  days, greater than the 4.56  days of the maximum 6 * limit. Many maritime voyages do occur on time, but the delay for missing a scheduled service might occasionally inject a weeklong delay {{waiting for the next}} voyage.

The main argument provided by companies is that this process is done to gain economies of scale and operational synergies. In order to test this argument an average cost function that depends on the number of operators in the industry, thus if there are strategic agreements or not among carriers, has been estimated and it has been found to decrease when strategic alliances are established. This means a better situation in terms of efficiency due to the concentration of the sector but it does not mean lower prices or an increase in the general level of welfare.

40|$|The Canadian {{traveler}} problem (CTP) is a simple, yet challenging, stochastic {{optimization problem}} wherein an agent {{is given a}} graph where some edges are blocked with certain probabilities {{and the status of}} these edges can be disambiguated dynamically upon reaching an incident vertex.

We call our algorithm CAO*, which stands for AO* with caching. CAO* uses a caching mechanism to avoid re-expansion of previously visited states and makes use of admissible upper bounds at a node level for dynamic state-space pruning. CAO* is not polynomial time, but it can dramatically shorten the execution time needed to find an exact solution for moderately sized instances.

40|$|This {{assignment}} {{problem is}} investigated in several steps. First, a myopic deterministic version is studied in which travel time, service {{time and the}} demands are fixed. A new non-decreasing partitioning scheme to deal with time window constraints for this problem is developed. A feasible option for solving the dynamic assignment problem is to repeatedly apply this deterministic algorithm in a dynamic setting in a rolling horizon framework whenever new information is available. The deterministic algorithm provides a basis for further consideration of stochastic factors including queuing times, handling times and travel times under traffic congestion. Several stochastic models are proposed and discussed. The discussion indicates that direct adoption of stochastic models aimed at other problems involves great difficulty because of the complex nature of this problem. Therefore, approximation models are preferable. Further, by incorporating additional requirements of trailer repositioning, a more general problem of multi-layered resource allocation is defined. Multi resource allocation problems have wide practical implications in air, rail and <b>maritime</b> <b>carrier</b> fleet operations. The discussion of these models highlights a promising opportunity for future research. All the methods and ideas motivated by this specific assignment problem can be easily extended to other routing and scheduling problems. As part of this research, we further investigated some NP-hard problems that generally underlie such applications. A special case of TSP problem, titled "the TSP with separation requirement", is examined and a new formulation is presented. The formulation takes the TSP with precedence constraints and the time dependent TSP as special cases. Additionally, a new general cutting plane method is proposed. It applies, but is not limited to, integer programming problem with binary variables. We believe that this method has some advantages over its counterpart, Gomory's method.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the {{production}} process in the offshore Oil & Gas (O&G) industry has concentrated on innovative subsea solutions. This development has increased the need for advanced multi-purpose Offshore Support Vessels (OSV). Their role in oil field development has widened the intersection between the traditional petroleum and maritime sector, leaving the borderline between them somewhat diffused. This has increased the need for interfacing the two business sectors. As a response to the demand of innovative and efficient solutions, the O&G industry has implemented its novel operation scenario solution, termed Integrated Operations (IO). However, this study shows that the maritime sector is still oblivious to IO and its proven effect in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCF). The remarkable difference in the operational approach between the two sectors is a challenging situation as {{there is a need for}} a seamless interface between the two operational environments. This study describes the opportunities and limitations of adapting the IO approach into Maritime Asset Management (MAM) and specifically in the OSV management companies. The study has a practical approach to <b>actual</b> <b>maritime</b> operations, using specific problems encountered during normal operations, critical maintenance operations and an environmental initiative project. By the use of three industrial case studies, supported by interviews, the frictional elements in the operational interface of the two sectors have been identified.

However, in order to utilize the full potential of IO several identified obstacles needs to be acknowledged by the maritime industry and mitigated through a joint effort and an open and including process. The study outlines 13 recommended actions specified to the authority, the oil field operator and the OSV companies for facilitating full implementation of IO into the maritime sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the competition among ports. In particular we study the relation between port characteristics and port market share of <b>maritime</b> traffic. <b>Maritime</b> <b>carriers</b> make two primary decisions that affect ports. In the long-term, they assign vessels to routes. In the short-term, they assign each shipment to a vessel and, with that vessel, a port. In this research, we assume that vessel schedules are fixed and model the assignment of shipments {{as a function of the}} attributes that describe each port. For a carrier, some assignments are simpler than other assignments. Each assignment should, however, take into account the same criteria. We begin by examining the scheduling of vessels for its effect on the assignment of shipments. We measure the impact of being a vessel's first or last port of call on a port's market share, and we discuss factors that might influence these schedules. We then examine the assignment to ports for exports of various commodity types as a function of geographic location (oceanic and inland distances), port characteristics (vessel capacity and port charges), and characteristics of vessel schedules (frequency and the order ofvisits). We use a multinomial choice model to analyze port choice. We find that the most significant factors are the geographic factors, which are beyond port control. The factors that ports can influence directly appear to be of far less significance. We also find that the choice processes vary with commodity type as well as carrier. The decisions are also found to differ between local and discretionary cargo. Our findings could affect decisions made by port managers as well as carriers or shippers. With the recognition of geographic advantages, port managers could focus marketing more effectively. Recognizing the impact of each carrier's schedules, they could suggest changes to carriers presently visiting the port or recruit new carriers to use present facilities more efficiently. Port managers could also evaluate more effectively investments designed to increase market share. Facilities or technologies could be incremented with a more accurate vision of future traffic levels at individual ports. ...|$|R
