40|$|In {{this work}} the {{activation}} of transparent PS substrates by chlorosulfonation is described and their {{distribution in the}} subsurface region is analyzed using vibrational spectroscopies. Confocal Raman microspectroscopy is shown to be insufficiently surface selective and only the highest modified samples can be analyzed using a mathematical procedure for the correction of diffraction effects on the depth profile. On the other hand, FTIR-ATR spectroscopy carried out using different internal reflection elements and varying <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence allows <b>discrimination</b> between the different modification profiles including those with low modification degrees obtained at low treatment times. The {{results show that the}} electrophilic aromatic substitution of polystyrene in pure chlorosulfonic acid is extremely quick with the complete surface covered by chlorosulfonic groups after only 10 min reaction time at - 10 Â°C. It is further demonstrated that the reaction is very surface selective and that even after reaction times as long as 3 h the modification is limited to a layer with a thickness of less than one m.

40|$|Mammalian {{cells in}} culture (BHK- 21, PtK 2, Friend, human flia, and glioma cells) have been {{observed}} by reflection contrast microscopy. Images of cells photographed at two different wavelengths (546 and 436 nm) or at two different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence allowed <b>discrimination</b> between reflected light and light that was both reflected and modulated by interference. Interference is involved when a change in reflected intensity (relative to glass/medium background reflected intensity) occurs on changing either the illumination wavelength or the reflection incidence angle. In cases where interference occurs, refractive indices can be determined at points where the optical path difference is known, by solving the given interference equation. Where cells are at least 50 nm distant from the glass substrate, intensities are also influenced by that distance {{as well as by}} the light's <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence and wavelength. The reflected intensity at the glass/medium interface is used as a standard in calculating the refractive index of the cortical cytoplasm. Refractive indices were found to be higher (1. 38 [...] 1. 40) at points of focal contact, where stress fibers terminate, than in areas of close contact (1. 354 [...] 1. 368). In areas of the cortical cytoplasm, between focal contacts, not adherent to the glass substrate, refractive indices between 1. 353 and 1. 368 were found. This was thought to result from a microfilamentous network within the cortical cytoplasm. Intimate attachment of cells to their substrate is assumed to be characterized by a lack of an intermediate layer of culture medium...|$|R

The level <b>of</b> colour <b>discrimination</b> in bumblebees, and honeybees (Apis mellifera) (based upon previous observations), exceeds predictions of models considering receptor noise in the honeybee. Bumblebee and honeybee photoreceptors are similar in spectral shape and spacing, but bumblebees exhibit significantly poorer colour discrimination in behavioural tests, suggesting possible differences in spatial or temporal signal processing. Detection of stimuli in a Y-maze was evaluated for bumblebees (experiment 2) and honeybees (experiment 3). Honeybees detected stimuli containing both green-receptor-contrast and colour contrast at a visual <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> approximately 5 °, whilst stimuli that contained only colour contrast were only detected at a visual <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 15 °.

40|$|This article {{examines}} discrimination {{in information technology}} (IT) organisations from two different perspectives [...] that of anti-discrimination law, drawing on reported cases <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in IT-related employment, {{and that of the}} experiences, understandings and responses of women IT professionals, drawing on focus group interviews with women from a range of private and public sector organisations. Both the cases and the interviews suggest that the major forms <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> against women in IT organisations revolve around pregnancy, maternity leave, the unavailability of part-time work to accommodate family responsibilities, and sexual harassment. However most of the women interviewed either did not see these as forms <b>of</b> <b>discrimination,</b> avoided the subject <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> altogether, or pointedly denied the existence <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in their organisation. The article then considers the phenomenon of the denial <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> and concludes that the,focus group interviews provided illustrations of the day-to-day 'practices of the self', whereby women IT professionals disavow their femininity and any disadvantages flowing from it.

40|$|People may be {{subjected}} to discrimination {{from a variety of}} sources in the workplace. In this study of mental health workers, we contrast four potential perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> (managers, co-workers, patients, and visitors) to investigate whether the negative impact <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> on victims’ well-being will vary in strength depending on the relative power of the perpetrator. We further explore whether the negative impact <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> is at least partly explained by its effects on people’s sense of organizational justice, and whether the strength of mediation varies according to the source <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Using survey data from 1, 733 UK mental health workers, a structural equation model was designed to test these hypotheses following a bootstrap approach. Discrimination from all sources was related to well-being, with that from managers having the strongest effects. The results support an explanation of the effect <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> on well-being in terms of organizational justice perceptions for discrimination from managers and from visitors, but less so for discrimination from co-workers or from patients. The study highlights the importance of differentiating amongst sources <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> at work and the salience of organizational justice perceptions in explaining the effects <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> from some sources.

The aim is to find out how the perception <b>of</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> may be linked to attitudes towards the proposal <b>of</b> the new <b>discrimination</b> legislation.
