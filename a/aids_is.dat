5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (<b>AIDS)</b> <b>is</b> {{defined in}} terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, including those who have died. <b>AIDS</b> <b>is</b> a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
50|$|One {{challenge}} {{for assessing the}} effectiveness of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that not all <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> intended to generate economic growth.

5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of <b>AIDS</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to have been}} in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Scouts South Africa is {{actively}} involved in community work, particularly {{in the rural areas}} of South Africa. In some rural areas, such as the greater Tzaneen area, there are Troops with over 100 Scouts. Rural Troops are often limited in their activities by funding and lack of equipment. Their programme focuses on educating the Scouts in becoming good citizens and in the dangers of HIV. Educating Scouts in HIV and <b>AIDS</b> <b>is</b> vitally important due to the large number of infections in both rural and urban areas of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). <b>AIDS</b> <b>is</b> a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from <b>AIDS</b> <b>is</b> inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from <b>AIDS</b> <b>is</b> inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the fungibility {{of foreign aid}} and makes three contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, fungibility of aid at the aggregate level is reexamined on a richer panel dataset of 91 developing countries for 1980 - 2009, taking into account endogeneity of aid and autocorrelation in residuals. Results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible: around 80 % is substituting rather than increasing government spending in the short run. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the sample, with aid being more fungible for countries with a low share of aid in GDP. Secondly, <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> disaggregated into bilateral and multilateral components. Despite substantial differences between both components, there are only very small indications that multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> less fungible than bilateral <b>aid</b> and estimates <b>are</b> volatile when <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> instrumented. Thirdly, this study attempts to distinguish between off- and on-budget aid at the aggregate level using the value of technical cooperation {{as a proxy for}} off-budget aid. While on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible, off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> non-fungible. In the long run, around 50 % of aid increases government expenditures, although results are not stable. High levels of fungibility (except for off-budget aid) suggest that resources spent on earmarking may be wasted and donors should rethink the way <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> distributed...|$|R

30|$|Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the {{one that}} seeks to enhance {{economic}} development. According to Lumsdaine (1993 : 38), this kind of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the sort of assistance offered with the pure objective of {{improving the quality of}} life. Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> usually offered on soft-terms and in long-term basis. Morgenthau (1962 : 304) refers to it as ‘aid for economic development’ and Hook (1995) labels it under ‘aid welfare’. The difference between humanitarian and altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that the former is provided in emergency situations and its interventions are punctual, while the latter seeks sustained development with long-term interventions.|$|R

40|$|<b>Aid</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} fungible at the {{aggregate}} level if it raises government expenditures by less than the total amount.

This study makes three contributions to both fungibility and fiscal response literature. First, fungibility at {{the aggregate}} level is re-examined on a bigger recent panel dataset, distinguishing between short- and longterm impact of aid. The results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible {{in the long run}} and highly fungible in the short run. Second, to account for aid bypassing the budget, technical cooperation is used as a proxy for off-budget <b>aid.</b> Off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> found to be non-fungible and on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible. Third, fungibility of bilateral and multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> analysed: the results indicate lower fungibility of multilateral aid...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the effects of aid on fiscal behaviour in Indonesia. There are four main findings. First, the inflow of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> driven primarily {{by the need to}} fill the fiscal gap; that <b>is,</b> <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> demand driven. Second, although project <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> by definition intended for development expenditures, it results in an increase in routine expenditure as well. This suggests that project <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> fungible: it creates extra resources available to increase non-discretionary spending. Third, programme aid tends to increase routine expenditure but not development expenditure; thus, it mainly serves as budgetary support. Fourth, aid flows make the Government of Indonesia fiscally “lazy”. The availability of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> a disincentive to mobilize domestic revenue through a more efficient and effective taxation system.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the {{development}} aid literature have concluded that bilateral <b>aid</b> flows have <b>been</b> dominated by strategic objectives of major donors. Similar analysis of multilateral aid flows has determined that these allocations are more sensitive to economic need and quality of institutions and policy of the recipient country. A consensus has emerged that all bilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strategically driven while multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> independent of these political pressures. This paper challenges these conventional notions of the different aid types by analyzing allocation decisions from U. S. bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. It finds that strategic considerations influence both bilateral and multilateral aid. Donor influence over multilateral aid allocations requires a rethinking of how strategic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> pursued. Improvements to the models of <b>aid</b> flows <b>are</b> offered, and a preliminary empirical analysis is attempted. It is found that the dynamics of strategic uses of <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> more complex that previous studies have concluded.
