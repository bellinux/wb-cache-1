40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by pathological lesions such as amyloid-beta (<b>A</b> beta) <b>plaques</b> and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Both these lesions consist mainly of aggregated A beta protein and this aggregation is affected by macromolecules such as heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. Previous studies demonstrated that HS enhances fibrillogenesis of A beta and that this enhancement {{is dependent on the}} degree of sulfation of HS. In addition, {{it has been reported that}} these sulfation epitopes do not occur randomly but have a defined tissue distribution. Until now, the distribution of sulfation epitopes of HS has not yet been studied in human brain. We investigated whether a specific HS epitope is associated with <b>A</b> beta <b>plaques</b> by performing immunohistochemistry on occipital neocortical and hippocampal tissue sections from AD patients using five HS epitope-specific phage display antibodies. Antibodies recognizing highly N-sulfated HS demonstrated the highest level of staining in both fibrillar <b>A</b> beta <b>plaques</b> and non-fibrillar <b>A</b> beta <b>plaques,</b> whereas antibodies recognizing HS regions with a lower degree of N-sulfate modifications were only immunoreactive with fibrillar <b>A</b> beta <b>plaques.</b> Thus, our results suggest that a larger variety of HS epitopes is associated with fibrillar <b>A</b> beta <b>plaques,</b> but the HS epitopes associated with non-fibrillar <b>A</b> beta <b>plaques</b> seem to be more restricted, selectively consisting of highly N-sulfated epitopes. status: publishe...|$|R
