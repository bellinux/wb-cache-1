40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy associated with mandibular <b>advancement</b> <b>by</b> intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO) with endoscopically assisted intraoral rigid or semi-rigid internal fixation. The study sample included all patients who had undergone an mandibular <b>advancement</b> <b>by</b> IVRO procedure with endoscopically assisted intraoral plate fixation from September 2008 to May 2012. An mandibular <b>advancement</b> <b>by</b> IVRO with endoscopically assisted intraoral rigid or semi-rigid internal fixation was used for mandibular advancement. The patients were analyzed prospectively, with more than 2 years of follow-up, and were evaluated in terms of functional results, postoperative complications, and skeletal stability. A total of 14 patients (bilateral, 7 patients with class II; unilateral, 7 patients with asymmetry) were included in the present study. The average degree of mandibular advancement was 5. 5  ±  1. 9  mm (range, 3 – 9  mm). Both the occlusal relationship and facial appearance in all patients were significantly improved by the surgical-orthodontic treatment, with no major harmful clinical symptoms. In addition, one-screw semi-rigid fixation could control postoperative passive condylar seating. This study showed that mandibular <b>advancement</b> <b>by</b> IVRO with endoscopically assisted, intraoral semi-rigid internal fixation offers a promising treatment alternative for patients with skeletal class II malocclusion or facial asymmetry...|$|R
