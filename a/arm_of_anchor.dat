50|$|Harrison {{developed}} the grasshopper escapement from a conventional anchor escapement which he built for a turret clock {{to go in}} the stable block at Brocklesby Park in Lincolnshire. This proved to be unreliable, needing repeated attention by which Harrison was inconvenienced, so around 1722 he modified the escapement by putting a hinge in the middle <b>of</b> each <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anchor.</b> The hinged pallets both pointed the same way, opposing the rotation of the escape wheel. As the escape wheel pushes the pallet, the hinge moves away from the escape wheel. The pallet pivots about its contact point with the wheel as it pushes the anchor. At the same time, the other pallet is approaching the wheel. When it contacts the wheel, it pushes it backwards slightly and contact between the wheel and the first pallet is broken. Both the pallets are slightly tail-heavy so that they naturally tend {{to move away from the}} wheel. The first pallet therefore moves out of the path of the escape wheel and the job of impulsing the pendulum passes to the second pallet.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The creep {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod in argillaceous {{soft rock}} is remarkable. The big undisturbed mudstone samples in Nanning Basin {{as a typical}} argillaceous soft rock is chosen to the research object in this paper. The laboratory simulated destructive tests and the creep tests <b>of</b> full grouted <b>anchor</b> rod have been down. Through the destructive tests of mudstone sample, the instantaneous adhesive strength between the anchor body and mudstone in Nanning Basin is 70 kPa. By analyzing the creep curves <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod, a conclusion {{is that there is}} a long-term adhesive strength <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod in argillaceous soft rock. When the design adhesive strength <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod is less than the long-term adhesive strength, eventually the anchor rod is stable during the process of long-term pull-out. When the design adhesive strength <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod is greater than the value, the creep <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod with the time will do not stop until the anchor rod failure. The greater difference value between the instantaneous and long-term adhesive strength, the faster the rate of creep, the faster the anchor rod failure. Finally, for the permanent support engineering design <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod in argillaceous soft rock, the paper gives two principles, as follows: (1) the design <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> rod in argillaceous soft rock must be determined according to the long-term adhesive strength.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{provides}} {{a method for}} designing anchor benches and trenches used to secure geomembranes exposed to wind action. Only the cases where anchorage is provided by gravity (i. e. {{by the weight of}} the material in the bench or trench) are considered. Anchorage by tensile members is not considered. Three potential failure mechanisms are identified for the case <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> benches: (i) sliding <b>of</b> the <b>anchor</b> bench in the downslope direction; (ii) sliding <b>of</b> the <b>anchor</b> bench in the upslope direction; and (iii) uplifting <b>of</b> the <b>anchor</b> bench. It is shown that the firstmechanism is themost likely and that the thirdmecha-nism is the least likely. Criteria are provided to determine the governing potential failure mechanism {{as a function of the}} geometry of the slope on which the geomembrane is resting and the geomembrane tensions induced by wind action. Equations are provided to calculate the required size <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> benches for each of the three identified potential failure mecha-nisms. It is shown that the usual method, which consists of only checking the resistance <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> benches against uplifting, is unconservative because, in the case <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> benches, lateral sliding ismore likely to occur than uplifting. The use of the proposed method as a con-servative approach for the design <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> trenches is discussed. Practical recommenda...|$|R

INTRODUCfION Although the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>anchor</b> plates at working loads is of considerable practical importance, previous investigations into the eleastic load-deflection behaviour <b>of</b> horizontal <b>anchors</b> have been restricted to the case of a fully bonded, perfectly flexible or infinitely rigid anchor resting in either an elastic half-space (Fox 1) or within an infinite elastic mass (Selvadurai 2). In this paper, an analytical technique will be presented for the analysis <b>of</b> an <b>anchor</b> <b>of</b> general shape buried at a depth h below the surface of an isotropic elastic soil layer (with elastic modulus E and Poisson's ratio II) which extends a further distance D below the anchor plate.

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, {{considerable}} {{attention has been given}} to the ultimate horizontal pull-out resistance <b>of</b> vertical deadman <b>anchors,</b> which are usually used together with earth retaining wall. Unfortunately, no significant effort has been made to understand/study the behaviour <b>of</b> discrete deadman <b>anchor</b> in earth retaining wall (anchored wall) subjected to the deflection of earth retaining wall. Therefore, this research aims to fill up this gap. The study on the behaviour of single-plate discrete deadman anchor in anchored wall subjected to the deflection of earth retaining wall is carried out by three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element analysis adopting finite element software named PLAXIS. The behaviour <b>of</b> discrete deadman <b>anchor</b> is studied by investigating the effects of several key factors. These include the effects of length of tie rod, embedment depth <b>of</b> <b>anchor,</b> spacing between deadman <b>anchors,</b> friction angle <b>of</b> soil, depth <b>of</b> <b>anchored</b> wall, and stiffness <b>of</b> <b>anchored</b> wall. Practicing geotechnical engineers are able to understand the interactions among soil-anchor-wall by studying the effects of several key factors on the behaviour <b>of</b> discrete deadman <b>anchor.</b> This allows practicing geotechnical engineers to determine the potential failure mechanisms and hence provide the most suitable design <b>of</b> <b>anchored</b> wall in geotechnical engineering. Furthermore, the effects of abovementioned key factors are summarised and design charts are proposed for the preliminary design <b>of</b> <b>anchored</b> wall. The design charts are developed based on limiting the wall deflection to 0. 5...|$|R
