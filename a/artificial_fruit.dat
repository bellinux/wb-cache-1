40|$|Modeling clays {{have been}} used in several {{ecological}} experiments and have proved to be an important tool to variables control. The objective of our study was to determine if fruit color in isolated and grouped displays influences the fruit selection by birds in the field using <b>artificial</b> <b>fruits.</b> Data were collected in six plots distributed homogeneously in 3 km long trails with a minimum distance of 0. 5 km. We used a paired experimental design to establish our experiments, so that all treatments were available to the local bird community in each plot. Overall, red was more pecked than brown and white. Isolated red and brown displays were significantly more pecked than others display. Even though our study was conducted in small spatial scales, <b>artificial</b> <b>fruits</b> appeared to be efficient in register fruit consumption attempts by bird. Although inconclusive about selective forces that sharp the dynamics of fruit color polymorphisms and choice by frugivorous birds, our findings corroborate recent studies wherein birds showed preferences by high- over low-contrast fruit signals...|$|R
40|$|Unlearned colour choices by {{consumers}} are generally {{interpreted as an}} adaptation to avoid unprofitable prey, often involving red warning coloration. However, red colour is a context-dependent stimulus. It signals palatability in ripe fruits, but unlearned fruit colour preferences have rarely been assessed. Therefore, we tested unlearned preferences {{and the effect of}} experience on differently coloured <b>artificial</b> <b>fruits</b> in an omnivorous bird. Naïve hand-raised blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) preferred red to blue, green, yellow and white <b>artificial</b> <b>fruits,</b> while adult wild-caught birds had no colour preference. In the area from which the experimental birds originated, red ripe fruits are present in 53 % of the species with fleshy fruit displays in summer. In these circumstances, unlearned preferences for red might facilitate food recognition in inexperienced fruit-eating birds. Unlearned colour choices should thus be interpreted in a broader context of foraging and not only to explain warning coloration. The contrasting choices of adult and naïve birds imply, however, a low potential for directional selective pressures on fruit colour evolution in this system...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fruit features such as nutrient content, size and colour have co-evolved with dispersal agent behaviour, physiology and morphology. Avian nectarivore feeding ecology is relatively well studied; however, less is known about fruit selection in avian frugivores. Previous work highlights the importance of individual factors that contribute towards fruit preferences, but few studies bring these factors together. Consequently the aim of this dissertation was to attempt this in terms of frugivory by investigating behavioural, physiological and morphological aspects of fruit selection in generalist avian dispersers. This was achieved by manipulating the nutritional content, size and colour of <b>fruits</b> (<b>artificial</b> <b>fruits)</b> under controlled conditions.

40|$|Fruit color {{changes during}} {{ripening}} are typically {{viewed as an}} adaptation to increase signal efficacy to seed dispersers. Plants can increase signal efficacy by enhancing chromatic (wavelength related) and/or achromatic (intensity related) contrasts between fruit and background. To assess how these contrasts determine the detectability of fruit signals, we conducted 2 experiments with free-flying crows (Corvus ossifragus) under semi-natural conditions in a 2025 m 2 aviary. Crows searched first for artificial red and black fruits and detected red fruits from a larger distance. Because <b>artificial</b> red <b>fruits</b> had higher chromatic and lower achromatic contrasts against foliage than <b>artificial</b> black <b>fruits,</b> crows apparently prioritized chromatic contrasts. Thus, the common change in fruit color from red to black during ripening does not increase signal efficacy to crows. In a second trial, crows searched for UV-reflecting and black blueberries (Vaccinum myrtillus) against backgrounds of foliage and sand. Against foliage, UV-reflecting berries had higher chromatic and achromatic contrasts than black berries, and crows detected them from a larger distance. Against sand, UV-reflecting berries had low achromatic contrasts and black berries low chromatic contrasts. Crows detected both fruit types equally, suggesting that they used chromatic contrasts to detect UV-reflecting berries and achromatic contrasts to detect black berries. Birds prioritized chromatic contrasts when searching for <b>artificial</b> red <b>fruits</b> in foliage but not when searching for blueberries on sand. We suggest that {{the relative importance of}} chromatic and achromatic contrasts is contingent on the chromatic and achromatic variance of the background. Models of signal perception can be improved by incorporating background-specific effects...|$|R

40|$|Culture {{evolution}} requires both modification {{and faithful}} replication of behaviour, {{thus it is}} essential to understand how individuals choose between social and asocial learning. In a quasi-experimental design, 3 - and 5 -year-olds (176), and adults (52) were presented individually with two novel <b>artificial</b> <b>fruits,</b> and told of the apparatus' relative difficulty (easy versus hard). Participants were asked if they wanted to attempt the task themselves or watch an experimenter attempt it first; and then had their preference either met or violated. A significant proportion of children and adults (74 %) chose to learn socially. For children, this request was efficient, as observing a demonstration made them significantly quicker at the task than learning asocially. However, for 5 -year-olds, children who selected asocial learning were also found to be highly efficient at the task, showing that by 5 years children are selective in choosing a learning strategy that is effective for them. Adults further evidenced this trend, and also showed selectivity based on task difficulty.

Due to its biochemical and pharmacological effects, Cordyceps militaris, commonly known as orange caterpillar fungus, is being inves-tigated with great interest. Cultivation of C. militaris has been practiced {{on a large scale}} in order to fulfill a demand for scientific investigation and product development. Isolates of C. militaris can be easily established from both spores and tissue. For isolation of spores, ascospores released from mature stromata are trapped in sterile medium.

Progeny ascospore strains can be isolated from <b>artificial</b> <b>fruiting</b> bodies, thus, the cycle of fruiting body production can be continued {{for a long period of}} time. In this study, we examined fruiting body production from multi-ascospore isolates and their progeny strains for three generations.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effect of odor and color on fruit predators and dispersers. The present study was conducted in a 30 ha area of secondary forest in Southeastern Atlantic Brazil. This area was divided into two transects, in which four points were marked with a 30 m distance from each other. Each sampling point contained a total of 30 <b>artificial</b> <b>fruit</b> which belong to six different treatment groups, with five <b>artificial</b> <b>fruit</b> per group. Each group was randomly placed on the ground and that <b>artificial</b> <b>fruit</b> was checked every seven days. For each group of five fruit, 5 mL of essence (vanilla or pineapple) were placed, and no essence was used in the control group. <b>Artificial</b> <b>fruit</b> was made with green and red nontoxic modeling clay, as well as artificial essences (vanilla and pineapple). A total of 960 fruits were used. Predated fruit equaled 26. 9 % (258 units), from which the red/pineapple had the highest predation rate (81. 9 %), followed by red/vanilla (46. 3 %), while green/control fruits were not predated. Throughout the experiment, bitten fruit and pecked fruit equaled 58. 3 % and 41. 7 %, respectively. No significant differences were recorded (x²= 7. 57, df= 5, p= 0. 182) between bitten and pecked fruit. Fruit color and odor are important in attracting predators and dispersers, which explains the high rate of predation of red/vanilla and red/pineapple, and the absence of predated fruits in the green/control group. Regarding the potential disperser, there was no statistically significant difference between pecked fruit and bitten fruit. As a result, it should be taken into consideration that zoochory (mammalochory and ornithochory) is the most important dispersal; therefore, it should be concluded that birds are more attracted by color and mammals by odor.
