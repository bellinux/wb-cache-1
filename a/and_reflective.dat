5|$|Shin used archival {{photographs}} of the 2nd and 3rd Avenue Elevated train (El) to create compositions in ceramic tile, glass mosaic, and laminated glass. The imagery is manipulated and re-configured with each level having a different design. On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are ceramic tiles depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, a mosaic reveals the sky where the train had previously been present. The platform level features semi-transparent <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood.|$|E

In Longyearbyen, midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August, and polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February.

A Covenant design scheme of purples <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated the challenge they provided to players; several critics lamented the change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in Halo 3 and conversely praised their return in the later Halo: Reach.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the cases}} of most other {{refractory}} metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material {{that is one of the}} hardest materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, <b>and</b> <b>reflective,</b> and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E

For the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, a title decider with Mika Häkkinen, he {{replaced}} the German flag with a chequered flag motif <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> silver replacing the white areas. At the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, the German flag design {{was replaced with}} an Italian flag in honour of his team's home race. For the Brazilian Grand Prix race of 2006 (at the time intended to be his final Grand Prix), he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories. For the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet. The helmet, very similar to his current helmet, included the year of his début to the present, and the years of his seven World titles. For the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 300th Grand Prix appearance, he wore a special platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, 4th Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, KG (c. 1310 – 23 March 1361), also Earl of Derby, was {{a member}} of the English nobility in the 14th century, and a {{prominent}} English diplomat, politician, and soldier. The son and heir of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and Maud Chaworth, he became one of Edward III's most trusted captains in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War and distinguished himself with victory in the Battle of Auberoche. He was a founding member and the second Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348, and in 1351 was created duke. An intelligent <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> man, Grosmont taught himself to write and was the author of the book Livre de seyntz medicines, a highly personal devotional treatise. He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which was established by two of the guilds of the town in 1352.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E

30|$|The {{assessment}} of the measurement model includes the evaluation of reliability, convergent validity, <b>and</b> discriminant validity. <b>Reflective</b> <b>and</b> formative constructs are treated differently; for formative constructs, different indicators {{are not expected to}} demonstrate internal consistency <b>and</b> correlations, unlike <b>reflective</b> constructs (Chin & Todd 1995). The relevance and level of contribution of each indicator was assessed by examining the absolute indicator weights. Taking into account the recommendations of Lewis et al.
