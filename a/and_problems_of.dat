5|$|Dava Sobel {{argues that}} prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues {{that the problem of}} Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} was {{not observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E

25|$|Dava Sobel {{argues that}} during this time, Urban had fallen under the {{influence}} of court intrigue <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> state. His friendship with Galileo began to take second place to his feelings of persecution and fear for his own life. The problem of Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo, following claims by a Spanish cardinal that Urban was a poor defender of the church. This situation did not bode well for Galileo's defense of his book.|$|E
25|$|Before ratifying the Constitution in 1787, the {{thirteen}} states were {{bound by the}} Articles of Confederation, which authorized the Continental Congress to conduct foreign diplomacy and granted sovereignty to the states. By 1787, both Congress and the states had accumulated considerable debt from the Revolutionary War, but the Articles of Confederation denied Congress the powers of taxation and regulation of foreign and interstate commerce. Alexander Hamilton, {{along with many other}} Framers, believed the solution to this <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> federal law enforcement could be solved with a strong centralized government.|$|E

After two years Darrow felt {{he was ready to}} take on new and different cases and moved his practice to Ashtabula, Ohio, which had a population of 5,000 people and was the largest city in the county.

25|$|The {{building}} design was reviewed {{to incorporate the}} necessary protection for the UK's foreign intelligence gathering agency. This includes overall increased security, extensive computer suites, technical areas, bomb blast protection, emergency back-up systems and protection against electronic eavesdropping. While the details and cost of construction have been released, about {{ten years after the}} original National Audit Office (NAO) report was written, some of the service's special requirements remain classified. The NAO report Thames House and Vauxhall Cross has certain details omitted, describing in detail the cost <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> certain modifications, but not what these are. Rob Humphrey's London: The Rough Guide suggests one of these omitted modifications is a tunnel beneath the Thames to Whitehall. The NAO put the final cost at £135.05m for site purchase and the basic building, or £152.6m including the service's special requirements.|$|E

25|$|The women labourers were {{surprisingly}} {{important to}} the canal's engineering. Many came from former Roman bath colonies in the Pyrenees, where elements of classical hydraulics had been maintained as a living tradition. They were employed at first to move earth to the dam at Saint Ferréol, but their supervisors, who were struggling to design the channels from the dam to the canal, recognized their expertise. Engineering in this period was mainly focused on fortress construction, and hydraulics was concerned mostly with mining <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> drainage. Building a navigational canal across the continent was well beyond the formal knowledge of the military engineers expected to supervise it, but the peasant women who were carriers of classical hydraulic methods added to the repertoire of available techniques. They not only perfected the water supply system for the canal but also threaded the waterway through the mountains near Béziers, using few locks, and built the eight-lock staircase at Fonserannes.|$|E
25|$|A port of Pinball FX 2 to Xbox One was {{announced}} in March 2014. In July 2014, Zen Studios set a launch date for July 31, 2014 and further announced that the front-end {{would be free to}} download and include Sorcerer's Lair, with the game running in 1080p and at 60 frames per second. The announcement also noted that owners of the Xbox 360 edition of the game would have to repurchase Xbox One versions of tables they already owned on Xbox 360. Later that month, however, Zen Studios announced a delay of the release of Pinball FX 2 into August 2014, but added the delay was necessary in order to update the game to permit players to transfer their tables from Xbox 360 to Xbox One at no additional charge. On August 14, 2014, Zen Studios announced that Pinball FX 2 was officially available for Xbox One, including the ability to import tables from the Xbox 360 version. In October 2014, the Windows 8 version of the game was updated with a new pane-based UI and the ability to play all available tables in the game for free with video advertisements playing before each game. The option to buy full tables were maintained, as buying full tables in the new Windows 8 version removes the adverts and allows access to the tables' operator's menu feature. However, the update was plagued with issues, including some of the tables being (initially) removed post-update <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> restoring the full ad-free versions of tables if they were purchased pre-update, including the restoration of the then-fully free Mars table.|$|E

His stories gave the games context and addressed the pressures <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> {{growing up in the}} spotlight, moving sports from the realm of pulp magazines to serious fiction.|$|E
