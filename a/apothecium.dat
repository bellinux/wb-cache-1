5|$|Viewed with a microscope, {{the wall}} of the <b>apothecium</b> is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, {{leathery}} and compact, and covered with a fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.|$|E
25|$|Species in the Cookeina have a deep, {{cup-shaped}} to funnel-shaped fruiting bodies, or apothecia. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of}} the <b>apothecium,</b> the hymenium, is brightly colored, yellow to red, although the color will fade upon drying. The outer surface is less brightly colored. The excipulum, the tissue making up {{the walls of the}} <b>apothecium,</b> is thin and flexible. When hairs are present on the <b>apothecium,</b> they are fasciculate―made of bundles of cylindrical hyphae.|$|E
500|$|Helvella {{acetabulum}} has {{a deeply}} cup-shaped fruit body (technically an <b>apothecium)</b> {{that is up}} to [...] in diameter, and [...] deep. The inner spore-bearing surface, the hymenium, is brown, and may be smooth or slightly wavy; the exterior surface is cream-colored, and is covered with minute [...] "hairs". The ribs start from the cream-colored stem and extend almost {{to the edge of}} the fruit body. The stem is typically [...] tall by [...] thick. The odor and taste of this mushroom are not distinctive.|$|E
500|$|With many cup fungi, {{microscopic}} {{analysis of the}} anatomy {{and structure of the}} <b>apothecium</b> is necessary for accurate identification of species, or to help distinguish between related species that have a similar external appearance. In W.americana, the ectal excipulum (the outer layer of tissue comprising the apothecia) is 125µm thick, and composed of dark angular to roughly spherical cells that are 40–70µm in diameter. The angular cells form pyramidal warts on the outer surface. The medullary excipulum (the inner fleshy layer of tissue underneath the ectal excipulum) is almost gelatinous, composed of interwoven hyphae 10µm in diameter.|$|E
500|$|The cap of this fungus (known {{technically}} as an <b>apothecium)</b> is [...] {{in diameter}} by [...] long, with a conical or bell shape. It is folded into longitudinal ridges that often fuse together (anastomose) in a vein-like network. The cap {{is attached to}} the stem at the top only—hanging {{from the top of the}} stipe, with the lobed edge free from the stem—and varies in color from yellowish brown to reddish brown; the underside of the cap is pale. The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cream-white in color, and tapers upward so that the stem is thicker at the base than at the top. Although the stem is initially loosely stuffed with cottony hyphae, it eventually becomes hollow in maturity; overall, the mushroom is rather fragile. The spore deposit is yellow, and the flesh is white.|$|E
500|$|The cap of {{the fruit}} body (technically an <b>apothecium)</b> is up to [...] high by [...] wide and is reddish brown, and {{somewhat}} saddle-shaped with 2–4 lobes. It frequently develops blackish-brown spots on the surface. During {{the development of the}} mushroom, the periphery of the cap grows into the stipe below, to form a hollow, roughly bell-shaped structure with the fertile spore-bearing surface (the hymenium) on the outside; as the surface growth of the hymenium continues to expand even after joining to the stipe, the hymenium can no longer follow and it arches up into folds and pads. The stipe, typically between [...] high and [...] thick, can be various colors from reddish brown to whitish or even bluish, but is typically lighter colored than the cap. The stipe is minutely tomentose – covered with a layer of very fine hairs. The context is thin (1–2mm) and brittle. G.infula does not have any appreciable odor or taste.|$|E
500|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{collected}} in Austin, Texas, in 1893 by botanist Lucien Marcus Underwood, who sent the specimens to mycologist Charles Horton Peck for identification. Peck described the species as Urnula geaster in that year's Annual Report of the New York State botanist, although he expressed doubt about its generic placement in Urnula. In 1902, student mycologist Elsie Kupfer questioned the proposed classification of various {{species in the}} genera Urnula and Geopyxis, as suggested in an 1896 publication on the Discomycetes by German mycologist Heinrich Rehm. She considered Rehm's transfer of the species to the genus Geopyxis illogical: [...] "Even externally the fungus does not closely answer Rehm's own description of the genus Geopyxis under which he places it; {{the texture of the}} <b>apothecium</b> is described as fleshy, the stem, as short and sometimes thin; while in this plant, the leathery character of the cup and the length and thickness of the stem are its noticeable features." [...] Working with Underwood's guidance, Kupfer compared the microscopic structure of the hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue) of the Texan species with a number of similar ones—Geopyxis carbonaria, Urnula craterium, and Urnula terrestris (now known as Podophacidium xanthomelum). She concluded that the Texan species was so dissimilar as to warrant its own genus, which she named Chorioactis. Although this taxonomical change was opposed in later studies of the fungus by Frederick De Forest Heald and Frederick Adolf Wolf (1910) and Fred Jay Seaver (1928, 1942), Chorioactis was established as a valid genus in 1968 by Finn-Egil Eckblad in his comprehensive monograph about the Discomycetes.|$|E

5000|$|Germinating ascospores cause {{very early}} {{symptoms}} on mature foliage that appear as several small cream-coloured {{spots on the}} upper surface of individual cedar leaflets. These spots later develop into lesions, which coalesce as a discreet spot, but the entire leaf becomes brown contrasting with adjacent green, healthy leaves. Infected leaflets are scattered over a branch, but they only occur on the previous year's leaflets, and not the current year's growth. Mycelial growth occurs within individual leaflets and once sufficient growing degree days have accumulated under suitable environmental conditions, apothecia are formed. A cross section of leaflet through an <b>apothecium</b> shows that the <b>apothecium</b> is initially covered by the leaf cuticle and a one-cell thick epidermal layer which is golden brown to brown in colour. The <b>apothecium</b> is raised slightly above the surrounding leaf tissue. When the epidermal covering breaks three quarters around the circumference of the <b>apothecium,</b> it lifts up as a scale, exposing the hymenial layer. As the exposed <b>apothecium</b> matures, it changes from golden brown to dark brown in colour. When moist, the cushion-like hymenial layer of the <b>apothecium</b> is golden-olive. At this point ascospores are released. When dry, apothecia appear much darker and the epidermal scale often folds back over the <b>apothecium,</b> and no further ascospores are released. Under repeated episodes of wetting and drying for up to week, ascospore release can occur. Discharged ascospores are covered with a sticky, mucilaginous coating that attach the ascospores to any type of surface. [...] Where ascospores stick to the host material, they produce a germ tube and directly penetrate the epidermis, and not through stomata. Affected leaflets often remain on the tree, weathering to a grey colour with dark cavities where spent apothecia have either shrivelled or fallen out. No anamorphic stage is known.|$|E

50|$|Lichens {{reproduce}} {{by means}} of spores or vegetatively. This characteristic is also seen in free-living fungi and many other plants. There are three common spore-bearing structures found in lichens: the <b>apothecium,</b> the perithecium and the pycnidium. The <b>apothecium</b> is described as being either sessile or immersed. The thallus is known as sessile if it sits atop the surface of its growth medium. If the <b>apothecium</b> is level with or sits below the surface it is known as immersed. The second form of spore-bearing structure is a perithecium which refers to the complete immersion in the substratum of rock or bark. Finally, the pycnidium, commonly seen {{on the surface of}} foliose lichen and crustose lichen, are absent in fruticose lichens.|$|E

50|$|An <b>apothecium</b> is a wide, open, saucer-shaped or {{cup-shaped}} fruit body. It is sessile and fleshy. The {{structure of}} the <b>apothecium</b> chiefly consists of three parts: hymenium (upper concave surface), hypothecium, and excipulum. The asci {{are present in the}} hymenium layer. The asci are freely exposed at maturity. An example are the members of Dictyomycetes. Here the fertile layer is free, so that many spores can be dispersed simultaneously. The morel, Morchella, an edible ascocarp, not a mushroom, favored by gourmets, is a mass of apothecia fused together in a single large structure or cap. The genera Helvella and Gyromitra are similar.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} {{characterized}} by having stiff brown hairs {{on the surface of}} the ectal excipulum, the outer layer of the <b>apothecium.</b> The ectal excipulum is thin, and made of roughly spherical to somewhat spherical/angular cells.

50|$|A podetium (plural podetia) is a lichenized stem-like {{structure}} of an <b>apothecium</b> {{rising from the}} primary body of the thallus. Since {{it is part of}} the reproductive tissue, it is not considered part of the thallus. The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. It usually bears the pycnidia or apothecia or both.|$|E
50|$|Apothecia {{are small}} and either {{scattered}} through the thallus or grouped in small clusters; diameters rarely greater than 0.8 mm. The orange disc (a deeper colour than the thallus) surface is concave initially but matures to convex; the <b>apothecium</b> rim also narrows giving {{the effect that the}} convex disc is spilling over it.|$|E
50|$|A set of {{characteristics}} such as excipulum and hamathecium structure, ascospore color and iodine reaction, and chemistry, was suggested to reach a much more sufficient genus model. The excipulum is the cup shaped tissue that holds the hymenium, asci, in the <b>apothecium.</b> The hamathecium is the hypha emerging between the asci of the hymenium.|$|E
50|$|The {{three most}} common spore body types are raised discs called apothecia (singular: <b>apothecium),</b> bottle-like cups {{with a small}} hole at the top called perithecia (singular: perithecium), and pycnidia (singular: pycnidium), shaped like perithecia but without asci (an ascus is the {{structure}} that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the Ascomycota).|$|E
