40|$|Mounting {{emphasis}} on construction {{supply chain management}} (CSCM) is due to both global sourcing of materials and a shortage of labor. These factors force increasing amounts of value-added work to be conducted off-site deep in the supply chain. Construction Supply Chain Management Handbook compiles in one comprehensive source {{an overview of the}} diverse research and examples of construction supply chain practice around the world. Reflecting the emergence of CSCM as an important area of multi-national research and practice, this volume takes an interdisciplinary perspective with contributions from leading international authors in three major areas: production and operations analysis, organizational perspectives, and information technology. The book begins with a survey of the current literature on modeling construction supply chain production and describes a set of approaches and methods for designing and operating project supply chains with references to design and materials production. It provides the basic framework for understanding the challenges and approaches to representing and improving supply chain performance. The next section recognizes the importance of considering arrangements between the different firms involved in designing, procuring, and <b>assembling</b> <b>construction,</b> and reviews various perspectives to understanding and improving organizational issues in the supply chain. The final section provides an overview of a range of information technologies that can contribute to supply chain performance, as well as examples of effective use...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analysed}} {{the results}} {{and the status of}} China's building energy efficiency, explored the new areas of building energy in future: the industrialized composite wall on construction. As China is engaginga process of rapid urbanization,it is believed thatlarge amount of construction will continue for 25 - 30 years, and all of new buildings must be strictly in accordance with the standards of energy-saving by 50 % or 65 % in the processes of design and construction. Chinese construction industry is currently implementing the “Four Savings and Environment Protection” policy, which requires energy, land, water and materials saving and environmental protection in every building project. In Heilongjiang Province, as other areas in China, the requirements of energy-efficient design have been comprehensively and strictly implementedon the new buildingssince 2000. By 2010, energy-efficient design has been completely popularized in all kinds of new buildings by 50 % energy saving compared with the same type of buildings built in 1980 s. According to the requirements of the Ministry of Construction, in the future the further energy efficiency targets should be increased from 50 % to 65 %, meanwhile the main field of building energyefficiencywill been changed from the initial entry points such as the thermal insulation of externalwall, roof, doors and windows to further wide areas, such as the Optimization of building material, component manufacturing, construction quality and method, all of which could be realized by the industrialized composite panels and walls completely. Industrialized composite panels and wallsbring thoroughgoing innovationson wall materials and construction, the improvementof the construction accuracy, so that the wall thermal insulation performance is much higher than traditional buildings. Due to the productionconcentrated in the factory and the batch processing, the energy consumption ofbuilding industrialization is much lower than the traditional human construction at the construction site. The industrialized composite panel and wall of buildings can reduce the loss of the main materials of construction,the <b>assembling</b> <b>construction</b> reduce the loss of Secondary buildingmaterials. Compared with traditional construction methods, building industrialization of the composite panelrealizesthe field fabricated construction, which greatly minimizes the generation of construction waste, building waste water emissions, construction noise interference, harmful gases and dust emissions, and so on. The Building industrialization could maximize the improvement of the quality of components and assembly precision, and effectively reduce the roof leaks, wall cracks, quality defects of wall and window such as cold air infiltration, so the architectural quality and accuracy can be improved significantly. Factory production and on-site assembling of prefabricated components can reduce the workers of construction site and management, saving a lot of labor costs. Building industrialization transfer most of the operation to production line, saving construction cost and schedule greatly. It is particularly important to the construction in cold areas. Moreover, three types of building composite walls and panel are introduced. In this paper, composite walls and panel include composite material, composite structure or both of them applied in the wall and panel. The first kind of composite wall is the straw board. The straw board is clean, which is made of natural straw or wheat straw as the main raw material. This kind of straw board is mainly used for internal and external walls of the building and roof of the building, etc. Straw board whichis regarded as wall materials generally does not work as load-bearing walls. When it comes to application, the surface should be decorated to ensure that its fire, moisture, fire-retardant abilities. Straw board is not only suitable for load-bearing frame structure buildings, including civil construction, light industrial plants, but also for the old buildings which need to be rebuild, storage buildings and temporary buildings, etc. It is a lightweight, high strength, thermal insulation board which is new and environmentally friendly, particularly suitable to use in cold regions construction. The second example is the HS-EPS core column structure system, whichis invented by Harbin Hong Sheng housing energy system research and development centre with the whole intellectual property patents. This system consists of base beam, EPS moulded wall composed with core column of reinforced concrete, eaves ring beam and roof trusses and other components, is suitable for various types of single storeybuildings. EPS module consists of polystyrene beads by heating and foaming, through a dedicated heat moulding equipment and moulds in the system with closed-cell structure of different types, different specifications and different shape. The modules are rectangular, which internal and external surfaces distribute the uniform dovetails. There are two bridges connecting the fixed plug door in the middle of three 200 mm × 240 mm rectangular hole, both inside and outside of the hole wall thickness is 50 mm. In 2010, itwas applied in Piaohe town as a pilot project and in Antu County as 800 post-disaster housing, where thissystem has been widely recognized. The third sample is Gao Ge Composite Panel of Husk Mortar, with the both advantages of composite material and composite structure. This panelis precast, made from light husk mortar, welded wire mesh and steel as the skeleton, and thermal, noise insulation layers. The husk mortar is made of cement, sand, husks and water by mixing. This panel can be used to the wall-bearing housing, and multi-storied and high-rise reinforced concrete frame construction as the envelope, its overall size is the same with the external wall of a room, as in Four sides of the panel are joined with the beams and columns of the buildings. The wall panel consists of two surface layer of husk mortar, and two insulation layer (benzene or rock cotton) and a air layer inside. The two surface layers are connected by the vertical and horizontal reinforced ribs, and the insulation layers are spliced inside by mortar, each small insulation board was totally fixed by insulation mortar from 5 surfaces. The cavities between two insulation layers are supported by the ribs...|$|E

40|$|Lattice truss cores are an {{emerging}} family of synthetic periodic materials that can add multifunctional capabilities to lightweight sandwich constructions while maintaining {{high standards of}} strength and stiffness. Recent strides in prototyping technologies allow efficient monolithic truss cores to be built from advanced metals without the nuisances of <b>assembled</b> <b>constructions.</b> Based on published models for these materials, this paper tackles the optimal design of tetrahedral truss cores for minimum density under prescribed constraints on strength and stiffness. A closed-form, single-pass algorithm is developed, which finds the optimum after {{a finite number of}} steps.

A numerical example demonstrates that optimized aluminium tetra-hedral cores outperform high-profile polymer foams and compete favourably with commercial-grade aluminium honeycombs of equal density.

Two students sit back-to-back in front of the class. One student (the teacher) gets the <b>assembled</b> <b>construction,</b> while the other student (the learner) gets the unassembled pieces. The teacher must describe the model and give instructions to the learner to build a matching model. The learner cannot speak or ask questions. The teacher may only use verbal instructions.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to developing software for formal synthesis in architectural design. It presents theoretical foundations, describes prototype specifications for computable implementation, and illustrates some examples. The approach derives from the observation that architects explore ideas through the use of sequences of drawings. Architects derive each drawing in a sequence from its predecessor by executing some transformation on a portion of the drawing. Thus, a formal design state is established by a sequence of drawings with historical information about their construction through progressive transformations. The proposed system allows an architect to develop a design in three ways. First, a new transformation can be added to a current sequence of drawings. Second, existing sequences can be edited by exchanging their subset sequences. Third, an existing sequence can be revised parametrically by assigning new values to its design variables. The system implements scripts that specify categories of shapes and transformations between any two shape categories. When an instance of a shape category is found in a design, a transformation can replace it with an instance of another shape category. Recursive application of a given set of transformations to an initial shape instance produces a sequence of drawings that represents a formal design state. The system encodes this formal design state as an assembly of all the shape instances used and their relationships (nesting, emergent and replacement). Furthermore, this assembly, called a construction graph, allows the existing sequences to be edited efficiently by exchanging subsets and to be revised parametrically. The advantage of this approach as demonstrated in the examples is that it allows intuitive, rapid and interactive construction of complex designs. Moreover, design knowledge can be captured by scripts that depict heuristic shapes and transformations as well as by <b>assembled</b> <b>construction</b> graphs which depict cases of formal design. Such a reusable and expandable knowledge base is essential for assisting disciplined and creative architectural design. ...|$|R
