40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach for}} one-dimensional dynamic compaction of foam produced <b>by</b> a <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is presented. Approximate numerical procedures for solving the Riemann problem associated with shock are implemented within the Godunov finite volume scheme for the fluid domain. A numerical framework for enforcing the traction and velocity continuity across the fluid–solid interface is presented. Numerical evaluation is performed considering foams of different strengths. Results {{of the analysis}} indicate that the fluid-structure interaction effects are significant only {{in the early part}} of the <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> history. The energy consumed during the dynamic compaction of foam produced <b>by</b> a <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is higher than the energy obtained as the area under the quasi-static stress-strain curve of the material. During the dynamic compaction of foam, there is a difference between the energy absorbed by the foam and the total energy consumed in the compaction of foam, which is available as kinetic energy of the compacted foam. The compaction of the porous material continues even after the blast over-pressure decreases below the crushing strength of the foam because of the kinetic energy available in the compacted foam. The energy transferred from the <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave to weaker foam is higher than the energy transferred to foam with higher crushing strength. There is a critical length of the foam when the energy absorbed by the foam is totally dissipated by the compaction of the material and the kinetic energy in the compacted foam becomes equal to zero. When the length of foam is greater than the critical length, the impulse of the transmitted pressure pulse is equal to the impulse of the reflected blast over-pressure. There is however a decrease in the pressure amplitude which depends upon the crushing strength of the foam...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} <b>by</b> which <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> waves cause mild {{to moderate}} traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are an open question. Possibilities include acceleration of the head, direct passage of the blast wave via the cranium, and propagation of the blast wave to the brain via a thoracic mechanism. The hypothesis that the <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave reaches the brain via a thoracic mechanism is considered in light of ballistic and <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave research. Ballistic pressure waves, caused by penetrating ballistic projectiles or ballistic impacts to body armor, can only reach the brain via an internal mechanism and {{have been shown to}} cause cerebral effects.

An Arrhenius equation was applied to derive the activation energy for the dissolution of CP Ti/Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI in sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) at different temperatures. In addition, white-light interferometry was applied to measure the surface nanomorphology of the implant to obtain 2 D or 3 D roughness parameters (Sa, Sq, and St). The nanopore size that formed after etching was approximately 100 – 500 nm. The surface roughness of CP Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI decreased as the activation energy decreased but weight loss increased. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI has a higher level of activation energy than Ti in HCl, which results in lower surface roughness after acid etching.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the {{behavior}} of conventional and modified sandwich plate designs subjected to blast loads is examined with the finite element method. The conventional sandwich design consists of thin outer (loaded side) and inner facesheets made of fibrous laminates, separated by a layer of structural foam core. In the modified designs, a thin ductile interlayer is inserted between the outer facesheet and the foam core. Two materials are selected for the interlayers; one is rate-independent, hyperelastic (polyurethane, PUR), {{and the other is}} rate and pressure-dependent, elastic–plastic (polyurea). A comparison is made between the two enhanced designs and the conventional design during an extended time period of 5. 0 ms under an exponential pressure impulse lasting for 0. 05 ms, and has a peak pressure of 100 MPa. Results show that utilizing PUR or polyurea to separate the outer facesheet and the foam core leads to a much reduced core compression, facesheet vibration, and overall deflection compared to the conventional design. Similar reductions are found in the kinetic energy and the stored and dissipated strain energy. This is attributed to the ability of the interlayers to store energy and shield the inner foam by exhibiting great stiffness under pressure. Although strain rates as high as 104 s 1 are produced <b>by</b> the <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> impulse in the sandwich plates, the strains in both the PUR and the polyurea interlayers are relatively small. This leads to generally similar responses for the two interlayer types, with the initially stiffer PUR providing a slightly better protection for the foam core...|$|R

40|$|A {{test setup}} {{consisting}} of a shock-tube with an instrumented short rod is developed for investigating the blast response of cellular concrete foams. In the shock tube facility, <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is generated by the rupture of a notched Aluminum membrane. An instrumented rod is calibrated for measuring transmitted stress from the cellular foam. Experiments are conducted on brittle cellular concrete foam, which exhibits non-linear stress-strain behavior associated with crushing of the cellular structure and subsequent densification. Crushing is initiated when the stress exceeds the crushing strength and continued crushing produces an upward concave stress-strain curve leading to densification of the material. Foams with two different crushing strengths are evaluated. The influence of length of the foam is investigated. For an applied <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> amplitude which {{is higher than the}} crushing strength of foam, the wave structure in the foam consists of an elastic precursor wave followed by a compaction front which produces crushing of the cellular structure of the material. From the experimental investigation, the existence of a critical length for completely attenuating the applied <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is established. For a given <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> loading, when the length of foam is larger the critical length, the applied <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is transmitted as a rectangular pulse of nominally constant magnitude, which is slightly higher than the crushing strength of the foam. The foam is compacted without significant densification. The critical length depends on the crushing strength of the foam and the <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> amplitude and duration. If the length of foam is smaller than the critical length, there is an enhancement in the transmitted stress amplitude. If the length of foam is significantly smaller than the critical length, the transmitted stress is enhanced to a magnitude higher than the applied <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> amplitude and the compaction of foam leads to significant densification of the material...|$|R
40|$|Results from an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} dynamic response of cellular concrete subjected to blast-pressure loading are presented. The cellular concrete has large entrained porosity {{in the form of}} uniformly distributed air cells in a matrix of hardened cement. Under quasi-static loading, once the applied stress exceeds the crushing strength of the cellular concrete, crushing and densification of material results in an upward concave stress-strain response. The shock-tube experimental test setup used for generating blast-pressure loading in a controlled manner is described. Experimental results from the cellular concrete subjected to blast-pressure loading with pressure amplitude greater than its crushing strength indicate that a compression stress wave, which produces compaction of the material due to collapse of the cellular structure, is produced in the material. As the compaction front propagates in the material, there is a continuous decrease in its amplitude. The impulse of the <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is conserved. When a sufficient length of the cellular concrete is present, the applied <b>blast</b> <b>pressure</b> wave is completely attenuated to a rectangular stress pulse.
