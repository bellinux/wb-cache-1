40|$|Modern {{military}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>transparency</b> systems, windshields and canopies, {{are complex}} systems which must meet {{a large and}} rapidly growing number of requirements. Many of these transparency system requirements are conflicting, presenting difficult balances which must be achieved. One example of a challenging requirements balance or trade is shaping for stealth versus aircrew vision. The large number of requirements involved may be grouped {{in a variety of}} areas including man-machine interface; structural integration with the airframe; combat hazards; environmental exposures; and supportability. Some individual requirements by themselves pose very difficult, severely nonlinear analysis problems. One such complex problem is that associated with the dynamic structural response resulting from high energy bird impact. An improved analytical capability for soft-body impact simulation was developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{scattered}} light, or haze, typically increases as transparent materials age, wear, become dirty, or become scratched from cleaning. Light scattered from scratched <b>aircraft</b> <b>transparencies,</b> such as windscreens, head-up-display combiners, and helmet visors, can potentially reduce pilot visual performance and reduce target detection range. Presented {{in this paper}} are {{the results of an}} investigation of light scattered from transparencies exhibiting different levels of wear and surface damage. Two methods of measuring scattered light are compared. Visual performance under conditions of white light scatter relevant to the use of helmet-mounted displays in the cockpit is also examined...|$|R
40|$|When {{birds and}} {{aircraft}} occupy the same airspace {{at the same}} time, bad things happen. Annual DoD costs probably exceed $ 200 Million per year, and dollar losses to world-wide aviation have been estimated at $ 3 Billion to $ 4 Billion per year (in US dollars). Much {{has been done in}} the past to improve the bird impact resistance of aircraft, and some further improvements would be cost effective on some aircraft. A new manufacturing technology for <b>aircraft</b> <b>transparencies</b> that can increase strength while slashing costs by 80 % is one promising approach. However, the “law of diminishing returns” comes into play, and the penalties involved in creating a truly “bird-proof” aircraft would be unacceptably high. Several new approaches and technologies for avoiding birdstrikes could be used {{to reduce the number of}} damaging birdstrike collisions. Some of these approaches are being used, and others are mature enough to enter the operational testing stage. Collectively, the more promising concepts could reduce birdstrike losses by 50 % to 80 % for those aircraft and/or airports that make use of them. Some strategies and points of contact for those wishing to pursue the new concepts will be provided. There are many facts and trends that optimists can focus on to be encouraged, and (for want of a better term) “good luck” has often been a factor in past birdstrike mis haps that kept severe damage from becoming a disaster. There are also many facts and trends that pessimists can focus on to be discouraged. An attempt will be made to provide a “good news” slant on many facts that are worrisome to many, to improve the spirits of those receiving the information and help them focus on key problems and candidate solutions.

40|$|An {{intensive}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the utility of manual densitometry and color additive viewing of <b>aircraft</b> and LANDSAT <b>transparencies</b> for monitoring land use and land use change. The relationship between land use and selected water quality parameters was also evaluated. Six watersheds located in the Cumberland Plateau region of eastern Kentucky comprised the study area for the project. Land uses present within the study area were reclaimed surface mining and forestry. Fertilization of one of the forested watersheds also occurred during the study period...|$|R
