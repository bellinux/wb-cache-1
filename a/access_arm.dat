25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or <b>access</b> <b>arm)</b> moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording – increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E

5000|$|The Saturn IB {{was used}} between 1973 and 1975 for three manned Skylab flights, and one Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight. This final {{production}} run {{did not have}} alternating black and white S-IB stage tanks, or vertical stripes on the S-IVB aft tank skirt, which were present on the earlier vehicles. Since LC-34 and 37 were inactive by then, these launches utilized Kennedy Space Center's LC-39B.

While the ET was being fueled, hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank through the GUCP, out a vent line to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance. Sensors at the GUCP measured gas level. The GUCP was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of STS-127 and were also detected during attempts to launch STS-119 and STS-133. The GUCP released from the ET at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with prior}} Z channel protocols, {{there is a}} concept of a channel to control unit [...] "connection". In its most {{primitive}} form, a connection {{is associated with a}} single channel program. In practice, a single channel program may result in the establishment of several sequential connections. This normally occurs during periods where data transfers become dormant while waiting for some type of independent device activity to complete (such as the physical positioning of tape or a disk <b>access</b> <b>arm).</b> In such cases, the connection may be closed by action of the device's control unit with the signaling of appropriate status. When the control unit is ready to resume such an interrupted connection, it signals the channel to reconnect and resume the interrupted channel program. By closing temporarily dormant connections, channel and control unit facilities may be better utilized to serve other active channel programs and certain protocol timeouts that might otherwise occur may be avoided.|$|E

30|$|Variables {{encapsulating}} {{the openness}} of the economy are often included in the empirical estimations (inter alia: Nikolaidou 2008; Dunne et al. 2003). The sum of exports and imports {{of goods and services}} measured as a share of GDP is the variable most preferred to quantify openness. The effect of openness on military spending is ambiguous. For example, Rosh (1988) postulates that countries highly integrated in the global economy probably find it easier to <b>access</b> <b>arms</b> markets and finance for arms procurement. On the other hand, however, {{it has been shown that}} international trade has a peace promoting influence both between belligerent countries as well as within countries (Seitz et al. 2015; Huang and Throsby 2011; Kollias and Paleologou 2017). The openness of the economy and increased access and participation of countries in international trade is a factor that reduces the probability of conflict (Huang and Throsby 2011) whereas the benefits from increased peacefulness also take the form of reductions in defence spending with the concomitant welfare effects (Seitz et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Background-Heart {{failure is}} {{associated}} with frequent hospitalizations, often resulting from volume overload. Measurement of intrathoracic impedance with an implanted device with an audible patient alert may detect increases in pulmonary fluid retention early. We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome. Methods and Results-We studied 335 patients with chronic heart failure who had undergone implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator alone (18 %) or with cardiac resynchronization therapy (82 %). All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance (OptiVol) and other diagnostic parameters. Patients were randomized to have information available to physicians and patients as an audible alert in case of preset threshold crossings (<b>access</b> <b>arm)</b> or not (control arm). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. During 14. 9 +/- 5. 4 months, this occurred in 48 patients (29 %) in the <b>access</b> <b>arm</b> and in 33 patients (20 %) in the control arm (P = 0. 063; hazard ratio, 1. 52; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 97 - 2. 37). This was due mainly to more heart failure hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 1. 79; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 08 - 2. 95; P = 0. 022), whereas {{the number of deaths}} was comparable (19 versus 15; P = 0. 54). The number of outpatient visits was higher in the <b>access</b> <b>arm</b> (250 versus 84; P < 0. 0001), with relatively more signs of heart failure among control patients during outpatient visits. Although the trial was terminated as a result of slow enrollment, a post hoc futility analysis indicated that a positive result would have been unlikely. Conclusion-Use of an implantable diagnostic tool to measure intrathoracic impedance with an audible patient alert did not improve outcome and increased heart failure hospitalizations and outpatient visits in heart failure patients...|$|E
5000|$|The first RAMAC {{to be used}} in the U.S. auto {{industry}} was installed at Chrysler's MOPAR Division in 1957. It replaced a huge tub file which was part of MOPAR's parts inventory control and order processing system. The 305 was one of the last vacuum tube computers that IBM built. It weighed over a ton.

Two independent <b>access</b> <b>arms</b> moved up and down to select a disk, and in and out to select a recording track, all under servo control.

More than 1,000 systems were built. Production ended in 1961; the RAMAC computer became obsolete in 1962 when the IBM 1405 Disk Storage Unit for the IBM 1401 was introduced, and the 305 was withdrawn in 1969.|$|R
