40|$|Extreme {{events are}} an {{important}} part of climate variability and their intensity and persistence are often modulated by large scale climatic patterns which might act as forcing drivers affecting their probability of occurrence. When the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) and the Equatorial Pacific (Niño 3 region) anomalies are of opposite signs and the first one is positive while the second one is negative, the rainfall response is stronger in the northern coast of Venezuela as well as in the Pacific coast of Central America during the Nov-Feb period. The difference between these two SST anomalies series (NTA-Niño 3) is used in this analysis and it is called the Atlantic-Pacific Index or API. By fitting a dynamic generalized extreme value (GEV) model to station based daily rainfall at different locations and to the Xie and Arkin dataset for the Vargas state, we found the <b>API</b> <b>index</b> to be an adequate index to explain the probabilistic nature of rainfall extremes in the northern Venezuelan coast for the months Nov-Feb.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{interpreting}} the major conceptual features of California's Academic Performance Index (API) as a coherent set of statistical procedures. To facilitate a characterization of its statistical properties, we first cast the index {{as a simple}} weighted average of the subjective worth of students' normative performance and present its estimation {{in the form of}} a linear model. In the process, we illustrate with an example several problems with this index for the study of a school's year-to-year progress. In its current usage the API lacks realistic estimates of precision and, on closer examination, further misrepresents conceptually student and school performance. We present an alternative analysis of the <b>API</b> <b>index,</b> based on a Bayesian meta-analysis of results from school-specific multilevel models of longitudinal student test scores. We introduce a display for the precision of estimated relative gains of each school {{in the form of a}} profile that represents the probability that a gain estimate exceeds set fractions of the distance the pretest is from the statewide target of 800. Along with estimates of their reliabilities, we also produce rank estimates of school API gains rather than simply ranking schools. We illustrat...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what perceived factors contribute to academic achievement in a high performing urban high school and whether or not there is a link between student engagement and academic achievement.; Historically, students in urban high schools have underperformed academically in comparison to their suburban counterparts. Nonetheless, some urban high schools, such as Trojan High School, have achieved significant gains in academic achievement. What contributes to the high academic achievement in these schools? Very little research has focused on urban school environments and as the global population increases, understanding how to increase academic achievement in these environments is paramount for future success.; This case study focused on a high performing urban high school in the Southern California Union High School District which recently had demonstrated steady academic achievement as measured by California's Academic Performance (<b>API)</b> <b>index.</b> Trojan High School met the definition for an urban school environment and fulfilled the criteria of a high performing urban high school.; A mixed method qualitative analysis was utilized to look for common themes and patterns to triangulate the data collected. Document analysis, observations, surveys and interviews were conducted for the data collection. An analysis of Trojan High School's High School Survey of Student Engagement (HSSSE) data compared student engagement at a high performing urban high school to student engagement levels nationally.; Factors such as campus community/culture, leadership and curriculum were perceived factors that contribute to academic achievement at this high performing urban high school. Conclusions utilizing the HSSSE indicated that students at a high performing urban high school were not substantially more engaged than their national counterparts. Other perceived factors significantly contributed to the academic success of the institution. Students at this high performing urban high school had the same levels of student engagement compared to the national HSSSE data. The analysis of the perceived factors that contribute to academic achievement played a greater role in student achievement than student engagement. Commitment to students in a caring environment, using data to guide best practices and instruction, and effective leadership and collaboration impacted student achievement more than student engagement...|$|E
40|$|White spot lesions {{associated}} with orthodontics {{are one of}} the major risks in orthodontic treatment and are considered a harmful side effect. The adjunctive use of high concentrated fluoride gels (amine fluoride) could be an effective method for the prevention of caries lesions during fixed orthodontic treatment. Elmex® gelée is indicated as an anti-cariogenic treatment for individuals at risk for caries. The primary aim of this Study was to compare the efficacy of weekly topical application of fluoride (tooth brushing with elmex® gelée) together with a tray application once every 3 months with the efficacy of a fluoride-free placebo gel in the prevention of white spot lesions in patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances. A total of 156 prospective orthodontic patients in Berlin participated in this study. The median age of all patients was 14 years (10 - 53 years). The study is a randomized double-blind, international, two centers study with two-arm parallel group design approved by the responsible ethics review committees (P 305 -R-EG 04). The results reported in this dissertation are related to Berlin. At the end of the screening visit, patients were randomly selected into one of two treatment conditions; test group and placebo group. The products (elmex® gelée or placebo gel) were supplied to the patients. Subjects in the placebo group were treated according to an identical test protocol. they received a placebo gel but without fluoride. Every three months visual examinations using the modified DMFS index were carried out to determined if any patient reached the endpoint. At the same appointments <b>API</b> <b>index</b> and oral hygiene habits were also recorded for both groups. Additionally, every three months tray applications either with the test substance or with the placebo, were administered. A toothbrush (elmex® interX short head) was provided every six weeks to both groups and they were required to brush their teeth once per week with their provided product. Professional tooth cleanings were given to every participant at baseline and at six months intervals. Every year bite-wing radiographs took place to determine if there was any new or progressing interproximal lesion. The study duration per patient was scheduled for a maximum of 30 months. If the teeth of the patient were debonded or an endpoint occurred before the end date, the study was terminated for that patient. The "Endpoint" was defined as follows: •	 cavitation •	 any white spot exceeding 2 mm in any direction •	 new or progressing approximal lesion detectable by bite-wing radiograph •	 more than 4 teeth affected with white spots (in any size) There were no differences in the baseline data between the two groups. The following hypothesis was tested: Endpoints will occur earlier and more frequent in patients using a placebo gel compared to patients using a fluoride gel (elmex gelée). The working hypothesis could not be confirmed statistically. Analysis of the data {{at the end of the}} study revealed that 43 % of the test group and 41. 6 % of the placebo group developed carious and early carious lesions, indicating no significant differences between the two groups. Nevertheless, white spot lesions occurred in 2. 9 % of the teeth treated with elmex® gelée and in 4. 0 % of the teeth treated with the placebo. The API remained unchanged at a moderate level during the course of the study for both groups. Oral hygiene habits were also at median not so good. The median amount of study medication shows a limited level of cooperation in the study population. Factors such as good compliance and adequate oral hygiene are very important for the prevention of white spots during fixed appliance. Safety analysis show that none of the adverse events or the serious adverse events that occured were related to the study treatments...|$|E
