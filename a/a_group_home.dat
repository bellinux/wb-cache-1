With each of these setbacks, Williams found himself using PCP more and more. To support his drug habit and obtain PCP, Williams would intimidate and/or rob drug dealers in South Central L.A..

25|$|Some {{believe that}} those who have a high degree of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>home</b> or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.|$|E
500|$|Brie Larson {{auditioned for}} the role of Grace via Skype after the script had been sent to her; John Gallagher, Jr. also won his role after a Skype {{conversation}} with Cretton, calling the screenplay [...] "probably the best script that I've been sent, ever". Larson and Gallagher prepared for their roles by shadowing line staff at <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>home</b> similar to that in the film, and collaborated to create backstories for their characters. Lakeith Stanfield was the only actor from the original short film to reprise his role in the feature. Cretton struggled to contact Stanfield when casting the film in 2012—Stanfield had stopped acting, left his managers, and did not own a cell phone—but Cretton was eventually able to reach him by email to tape an audition. Most of the children featured in the film were cast through open casting calls, and most had no prior acting experience. Alex Calloway, who played Sammy, found a casting call through Craigslist and won the role after sending in a cell phone video audition.|$|E
500|$|Not {{only did}} the Department of Information art advisors {{consider}} these new works dull, but the War Office censors also objected to three of the paintings. Nevinson was quite happy to reverse the direction of traffic in the painting The Road from Arras to Bapaume but {{was not prepared to}} compromise over the other two paintings. The censor objected to A Group of Soldiers on the grounds that [...] "the type of man represented is not worthy of the British Army". Amid the sarcasm and vitirol of Nevinson's response, he did make the point that the soldiers in the painting were sketched from <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>home</b> on leave from the Front that he had encountered on the London Underground. The canvas was eventually passed for display. Not so Paths of Glory, Nevinson's painting of two fallen British soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire. Told at the beginning of 1918 that the painting would not be passed for exhibition Nevinson insisted on displaying it with a brown strip of paper across it, with the word 'Censored' scrawled on it. This earned Nevinson a reprimand not just for displaying the painting but using the word 'Censored' without authorisation.|$|E

500|$|After {{the divorce}} became final in 1976, the children, then aged 12 and 9, {{returned}} {{to live with}} their mother, who was director of nursing at a Montreal hospital. [...] In 1977, the family moved to a house purchased in the middle-class Montreal suburb of Pierrefonds. Gamil Gharbi attended junior high and high school, where he was described as a quiet student who obtained average to above average marks. He developed a close friendship with another boy, but he did not fit in with other students. [...] Taunted as an Arab because of his name, at the age of 14 he legally changed it to [...] "Marc Lépine", citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother's surname. Lépine was uncommunicative and showed little emotion. He suffered from low self-esteem, exacerbated by his chronic acne. [...] Family relations remained difficult; his younger sister Nadia publicly humiliated him about his acne and his lack of girlfriends. He fantasized about her death, and on one occasion made a mock grave for her. [...] He was overjoyed when in 1981 she was placed in <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>home</b> because of her delinquent behaviour and drug abuse. Seeking a good male role model for Lépine, his mother arranged for a Big Brother. For two years, the experience proved positive as Lépine, often with his best friend, enjoyed the time with photography and moto-cross motorcycles. However, in 1979 the meetings ceased abruptly when the Big Brother was detained on suspicion of molesting young boys. Both Lépine and his Big Brother denied that any molestation had occurred. Lépine owned an air rifle as a teenager, which he used to shoot pigeons near his home with his friend. [...] They also enjoyed designing and building electronic gadgets. [...] He developed an interest in World War II and an admiration of Adolf Hitler, and enjoyed action and horror movies. [...] Lépine also took considerable responsibility at home, including cleaning and doing repairs while his mother worked.|$|E
