5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the day off from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had spent the <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E
5|$|However, Prime Minister Churchill was not {{satisfied}} with Ironside's progress, {{especially with regard to}} the creation of a mobile reserve. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside should be replaced by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> Brooke and was soon convinced that they were in close agreement as to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E

5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> my friend David Poe.

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is mostly}} active {{during the morning}} and the late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>with</b> the hottest hours of the day being spent in rest. These extremely agile and wary animals can run at speeds of up to , waving their tails and tossing their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} of {{parachute}} troops were dropped in two groups {{to the west of}} the cemetery at about midday. The drop zone was within fields of fire of the Partisans to the west of Drvar, and they suffered many casualties during the drop. Collecting the remainder, Rybka mounted a second attack, but the pressure on his flanks was too heavy, and the assault again failed. Fighting continued throughout the <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> both sides taking heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before the race; {{the first was}} held on Friday morning, with the second held on Saturday morning. Both were held in damp conditions due to overnight rain with the track drying towards {{the conclusion of the}} respective sessions. Both sessions lasted 1hour and 45minutes.

5|$|As {{this was}} happening, General Dean arrived {{south of the}} town with Lieutenant General Walton Walker to observe the conflict, and the final {{elements}} of the 34th leave Chonan. Dean ordered the 34th Infantry Regiment to retreat to the Kum River. 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry, now down to 175 men, had lost two thirds of its strength in Chonan, around 350 men. Most of the battalion's heavy equipment including mortars and machine guns were also lost. The North Korean radio reported 60 Americans were taken prisoner in the town. The regiment began its retreat in the late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>with</b> North Korean forces moving on ridges parallel to the regiment. Most of the battalion moved out on foot and by truck, resting {{on the evening of}} July 8 before arriving at the Kum River July 9 and setting up new defensive positions.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the four}} Tests, and being severely attacked in the previous match at Headingley, Johnson was dropped in favour of leg spinner Doug Ring. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> Ring not required to bowl, as the pacemen made light work of the hosts. Ring was economical in the second innings, taking 1/44 from 28 overs as Australia sealed the series 40 with another innings victory.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the largest}} crowd to ever witness {{a game in}} Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, Alabama {{defeated}} their long-time rival, the Ole Miss Rebels, 22–3. Alabama struggled to put {{the ball in the}} end zone all <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> drives stalled at the Mississippi 8, 4, 4, 4, and 13. Each of those drives resulted in a field goal by Leigh Tiffin, who was 5 for 5 on the day. Other special teams contributions included a blocked punt in the second quarter and a recovered Dexter McCluster fumble on a punt return in the third quarter, both by Cory Reamer. McElroy struggled, completing only 15 of 34 passes for 147 yards, but Mark Ingram ran for a then career-high 172 yards and accounted for Alabama's only touchdown on a 36-yard run in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Police Alf Reksten {{arrived in}} the {{afternoon}} and took over responsibility. Later, the ship Mira, belonging to Bergen Steamship Company (BSD), arrived with two doctors, two nurses, material from the Red Cross, specialist police officers, fire fighters, representatives from the airline and Norway Post, and journalists. The sister aircraft Najaden arrived later in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company. The three, along with Reksten and Bredvik, became the investigation commission.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 December, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) engaged the PVA 175th Regiment of the 59th Division at Hill 1542 and Hill 1419. The {{tenacious}} Chinese defenders soon forced the Marines to dig in on the slopes between {{the road and the}} peaks when the convoy passed 3/7's position by the <b>afternoon.</b> <b>With</b> Hagaru-ri still not captured, the PVA High Command scrambled the 79th Division to resume attacks on Yudam-ni while the 89th Division rushed south towards Koto-ri. The Chinese struck at night, and the ferocious fighting forced the rear covering forces to call in night fighters to suppress the attacks. The fighting lasted well into {{the morning of}} 2 December until all the Marines managed to withdraw from Yudam-ni.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{got under}} way on Saturday <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> new rules in place. Just as in years before, the {{qualifying}} procedure was divided into three parts, with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given point being taken out from contention every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot is {{a predominantly}} ground-based seed eater, foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest margins, and near trees in more open {{areas such as}} pastures. It occasionally feeds along road verges and rarely ventures onto lawns. Birds forage in pairs or small troops of up to thirty or even fifty individuals. Observations at Chiltern in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with turquoise parrots foraging in groups of 5–30 in winter and 6–8 in spring and summer. Foraging takes place from {{early in the morning}} till late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>with</b> a break between midday and mid-afternoon. Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged in the grass.|$|E
5|$|At 09:50 on 23 August, a U.S. PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (based at Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands) {{initially}} sighted Tanaka's convoy. By late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>with</b> no further sightings of Japanese ships, two aircraft strike forces from Saratoga and Henderson Field took off {{to attack the}} convoy. However, Tanaka, knowing that an attack would be forthcoming following the PBY sighting, reversed course once he had departed the area, and eluded the strike aircraft. After Tanaka reported to his superiors his loss of time by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike, the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August. By 18:23 on 23 August, with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of {{their presence in the}} area, Fletcher detached Wasp (which was getting low on fuel) and the rest of TF18 for the two-day trip south toward Efate Island to refuel. Thus, Wasp and her escorting warships missed the upcoming battle.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first <b>afternoon.</b> <b>With</b> the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} in second practice on Friday <b>afternoon</b> <b>with</b> {{a time of}} 1:37.583, using the super-soft compound. Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent {{him back to the}} pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time. Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas. Slowest of the session was Sauber's Marcus Ericsson, with the two Manor drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein slotting in ahead of him. Wehrlein reported a loss of power after crossing the chequered flag {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest {{in the first}} free practice session on Friday <b>afternoon,</b> <b>with</b> Räikkönen the only driver to lap the course in less than 1:38. The Mercedes team focused on long runs, running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively. Vettel's Ferrari showed problems early in the session, but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end. Jenson Button spun out in turn one on {{the start of his}} first flying lap and was unable to run again as his team tried to change his car's battery. It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless, since Button's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place, just seven-tenths away from Räikkönen's fastest time. After China the week before, Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus.|$|E
