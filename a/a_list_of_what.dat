5|$|In a {{statement}} on Egyptian state television, Suleiman announced the formation of two independent committees for political and constitutional reforms, both starting work immediately. One committee would carry out constitutional and legislative amendments to enable a shift of power. The other would monitor the implementation of all proposed reforms. Suleiman also stressed that demonstrators would not be prosecuted and that a separate independent fact-finding committee would be established to probe the violence of 2February. He said that wider press freedoms were under consideration {{and that he would}} produce <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was needed to hold free elections. He also said that plans were underway to organize a peaceful transfer of power. Suleiman reiterated his view that Egypt was not ready for democracy, while warning of a possible coup d'état unless demonstrators agreed to enter negotiations.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the stories}} within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first-person {{narrative}} {{from the point of}} view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices, such as [...] "a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent." [...] It suggests that, in contrast, [...] Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of [...] "official incompetence and aristocratic privilege". The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were [...] "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" [...] (as his favourite), [...] "The Red-Headed League" [...] (second), [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia" [...] (fifth) and [...] "The Five Orange Pips" [...] (seventh). The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its alleged [...] "occultism", but the book gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.|$|E

500|$|Very {{soon after}} its initial release {{in the spring}} of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the UK and US. Robin Wood wrote that [...] "Witchfinder General is {{certainly}} [...] most successfully achieved work ... what one is immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of what is on the screen... the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully. With it is associated Paul Ferris’ theme-music, which suggests a traditional air without being actual quotation. Against the peace and fertility of nature is set the depravity of men." [...] David Pirie, who wrote extensively and enthusiastically about the film in his 1973 book A Heritage of Horror, reviewed the film in 1971 for Time Out, commenting: [...] "...one of the most personal and mature statements in the history of British cinema... The performances are generally excellent, and no film before or since has used the British countryside in quite the same way." [...] Danny Peary noted, [...] "The Conqueror Worm is a stunning film in many ways, but probably Reeves's greatest achievement is {{that he was able to}} maintain an extraordinary momentum throughout, until the film ends as it began, with a woman (this time Sara) screaming." [...] In 2000, Derek Malcolm included Witchfinder General as part of his series The Century of Films, <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he considered to be the one hundred most [...] "artistically or culturally important" [...] movies of the 20th Century. Malcolm asserted that the film [...] "is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain" [...] and [...] "transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making." [...] In 2005, J. Hoberman of the Village Voice stated that the film [...] "...has long been a cult item– in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before [...] the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil... Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance... it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{creation}} of new words {{through the use of}} grammatical (i.e. inflectional) suffixes, such as nura (mere) from nur (only), tiama (contemporary) from tiam (then), or vido (sight) from vidi (to see), is covered in the article on Esperanto grammar. What follows is <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> are usually called [...] "affixes". Most of them, however, are actually lexical roots, in that they can be used as independent words and their relative order in a compound is determined by semantics, not grammar. They are called [...] "affixes" [...] mainly because they derive from affixes in Esperanto's source languages. Some are true affixes in that, although they may be used independently, their order within a word is fixed by the grammar. Only a few cannot be used independently and so correspond to how a typical affix behaves in English.|$|E
2500|$|Fire is {{moreover}} the [...] "auxiliary of the truth," [...] "and not only, {{as in the}} ordeal, {{of justice}} and of truth at the same time."

In Yasna 34-44 devotees [...] "ardently desire [...] mighty fire, through aša." [...] In Yasna 43-44, Ahura Mazda [...] "shall come to [...] through the splendour of [...] fire, possessing the strength of (through) aša and good mind (=Vohu Manah)." [...] That fire [...] "possesses strength through aša" [...] is repeated again in Yasna 43.4. In Yasna 43.9, Zoroaster, wishing to serve fire, gives his attention to aša.

Max Ernst's painting [...] "Europe After the Rain". Thomas Pynchon. The atmosphere of British Second World War films. The Prisoner. Robin Hood. Dick Turpin... The influence of such a wide number of references has been thoroughly demonstrated in academic studies, above which dystopian elements stand out, especially the similarity with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four in several stages of the plot.|$|E
2500|$|For the music, Uchikoshi {{wrote down}} {{directions}} about the mood and {{concept of the}} game, describing it as [...] "sad and lonely, like a worn-out record", and [...] "dark and visceral". Hosoe described the music as generally less melodic: {{because they could not}} make the music hit on queue like in film, they decided during the planning stage to include silence in the soundtrack, so Hosoe created atmospheric tracks to be used as background noise. Because the Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors characters Junpei and Akane and the Virtue's Last Reward characters Sigma and Phi appear in the game, Uchikoshi decided to have arrangements of songs from those two games included in the soundtrack. He also had the songs [...] "Digital Root" [...] and [...] "Trepidation", which had been used in both previous games, be included, as he saw them as a sort of theme songs that tie the games together as a series, similarly to [...] "The Imperial March" [...] from the Star Wars films. Hosoe received <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> songs were to be rearranged and how they were to be used within the game, and was asked to compose a total of 45 songs; he did however end up composing nearly 70 songs, ensuring that they had something that fit every situation in the game. For the ending theme, Hosoe incorporated several callbacks to songs from the previous games as [...] "a sendoff for the series", leading into [...] "Morphogenetic Sorrow".|$|E
