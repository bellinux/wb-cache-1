5|$|In Doe v. Wilson (1859), Justice Catron, for the Court, {{held that}} a treaty with the Pottawatomie created {{individual}}, <b>alienable</b> allotments; thus, the grantee of an individual Pottowatomie had good title.|$|E
25|$|The affixed {{possession}} {{paradigm for}} inalienable and <b>alienable</b> possessives can be derived. The <b>alienable</b> possessives only use the first consonant of the <b>alienable</b> prefixes {{and do not}} mark the possessor when the prefix begins with a vowel. The final suffix transforms into a diphthong from /-o/.|$|E
25|$|One typological study {{discovered}} that in 78% of South American languages that do distinguish between inalienable and <b>alienable</b> possession, inalienable possession {{was associated with}} fewer morphological markers than its <b>alienable</b> counterpart; by contrast, {{only one of the}} surveyed languages required more morphological features to mark inalienable possession than <b>alienable</b> possession. If a language makes a grammatical distinction between <b>alienable</b> and inalienable nouns, it is redundant to have an overt possessive marker to mark inalienability; by nature of being inalienable, a noun must be possessed.|$|E
25|$|Hawaiian uses {{different}} prepositions to mark possession {{depending on}} alienability. a (<b>alienable</b> of) {{is used to}} indicate <b>alienable</b> possession, as in (13a) and (14a), whereas o (inalienable of) indicates inalienable possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>alienable</b> and inalienable possession is often marked with various morphosyntactic properties such as morphological markers and word order. There {{is a strong}} typological pattern for inalienable possession to require fewer morphological markers than <b>alienable</b> possession constructions.|$|E
25|$|In the {{inalienable}} reading, arm is {{a complement}} of the determiner phrase. This contrasts to the <b>alienable</b> reading where John has an arm {{is part of}} the determiner. Fillmore and Chomsky make a syntactic distinction between <b>alienable</b> and inalienable possession and suggest that this distinction is relevant to English.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between a (<b>alienable</b> of) and o (inalienable of) is used for other semantic distinctions less clearly attributable to common alienability relationships except in metaphorical ways. Although lei is a tangible object, in Hawaiian this noun can be either <b>alienable</b> (15a) or inalienable (15b) depending on the context.|$|E
25|$|This is {{demonstrated}} in Hua, a Papuan language. In Hua, <b>alienable</b> possession {{is marked by}} a free form pronoun as in (27a). In contrast, inalienable possession constructions use an inalienable possessor prefixed on the possessee, as in (27b). This construction has less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee than in the <b>alienable</b> construction.|$|E
25|$|Other things, such as most objects, {{may or may}} not be possessed. When {{these types}} of objects are possessed, the {{possession}} is <b>alienable.</b> <b>Alienable</b> possession is generally used for tangible items which one might cease to own at some point (e.g. my money) whereas inalienable possession refers to a perpetual relationship which cannot be readily severed (e.g. my mother).|$|E
25|$|In {{inalienable}} possession constructions, {{the relationship}} between the possessor and possesee is stronger than in <b>alienable</b> possession constructions. Johanna Nichols characterizes this through the tendency of inalienable possession to be head-marked but <b>alienable</b> possession to be dependent-marked. In head-marking, the head of an inalienable possession construction (the possessed noun) is marked, whereas in dependent-marking, the dependent (the possessor noun) is marked.|$|E
25|$|The possessive {{morpheme}} ɛ̃̀ɟ in examples (3) and (4) {{indicates an}} <b>alienable</b> relationship between possessor and possessee.|$|E
25|$|German uses a {{definite}} article (die) for the inalienable body part construction, but a possessive (meine) for <b>alienable</b> possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>alienable</b> and inalienable possessions can {{be influenced by}} cognitive factors. Languages, such as English, that do not encode the alienability distinction in their grammar rely on the real-world relationship between the possessed noun and possessor noun. Nouns that are “inherently relational” and whose possession {{is associated with a}} single, dominant interpretation (e.g. mother), are of the inalienable type, whereas nouns whose possession is open to interpretation (e.g. car), are of the <b>alienable</b> type.|$|E
25|$|Cavite's land {{resources}} are categorized into two: forest lands and <b>alienable</b> and disposable lands. Forest lands are being maintained as {{they play a}} great role for the ecological balance of the province {{aside from the fact}} that they are home to numerous flora and fauna that needs to be protected and preserved. Correspondingly, the <b>alienable</b> and disposable lands are the built-up areas as well as production areas. These lands are intended for urban, economic and demographic developments.|$|E
25|$|However, the genitive {{follows the}} possessee in <b>alienable</b> {{possession}} constructions, such as (10). In this sentence, the genitive Petrus follows the possessee amah.|$|E
25|$|Nichols {{notes that}} {{frequently}} possessed nouns, such as body parts and kinship terms, almost always occur with possessors, whereas <b>alienable</b> nouns occur with possessors less often.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{relationships}} listed above {{are likely to}} be instances of inalienable possession, ultimately what is classified as inalienable depends on language- and culture-specific conventions. It is impossible to say that a particular relationship is an example of inalienable possession without specifying the languages for which this holds true. For example, neighbor may be an inalienable noun in one language, but <b>alienable</b> in another. Thus, whether a certain type of relationship is described as <b>alienable</b> or inalienable can be arbitrary, and in this respect alienability is similar to other types of noun classes, such as grammatical gender.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{languages}} {{distinguish between}} <b>alienable</b> and inalienable possession {{is to have}} one noun class that cannot appear without an explicit possessor. For example, Ojibwe, an Algonquian language, has a class of nouns that must have explicit possessors.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{semantic}} dependency {{is the difference between}} possible interpretations in a language that marks inalienable possession (e.g. French) with a language that does not (e.g. English). Inalienable possession is semantically dependent and is defined in reference to another object to which it belongs. (20) is ambiguous and has two possible meanings. In the inalienable possessive interpretation, la main belongs to the subject, les enfants. The second interpretation is that la main is an <b>alienable</b> object that does not belong to the subject. The English equivalent of this sentence (The children raised the hand) only has the <b>alienable</b> possessive reading in which the hand does not belong to the children.|$|E
25|$|The {{examples}} below {{illustrate that}} the same phrase, the table's legs, is regarded as inalienable possession in Italian but not in French: (1b) is ungrammatical (as indicated by the asterisk); French cannot use the inalienable possession construction for a relationship which is <b>alienable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{shows the}} frequency of possession between <b>alienable</b> and unalienable nouns in German. The table below shows {{the number of times}} each noun occurred with or without a possessor in texts from the German Goethe-Corpus, comprising works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.|$|E
25|$|Based {{from the}} record of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the {{municipality}} of Quezon has a forest zone of 36km². Quezon had 153.9km² of <b>alienable</b> and disposable lands. However, most of these areas are actually open grasslands and denuded. Only a few areas are planted with trees as a result of reforestation projects in the past.|$|E
25|$|Being <b>alienable</b> and {{disposable}} lands, the Chocolate Hills {{are seen}} as quarrying assets and {{source of income for}} small-scale miners, as well as quarry materials for the province's construction projects. The challenge is how the national and local officials can harmonize the current needs of small-scale miners, the construction sector and the tourism sector with the preservation of the Chocolate Hills.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>alienable</b> and inalienable possession constructions may be {{marked with a}} difference in word order. Igbo uses another syntactic process when the subject and the possessor refer to different entities. In possessor switch, the possessor of the inalienable noun is placed {{as close as possible}} to the verb. In the following examples, the possessor yá is not deleted because the two referents in this sentence are different.|$|E
25|$|The {{region has}} a total land area of , {{representing}} 6.3% of the country's total land area and 18.5% {{of the island}} of Mindanao. 47.6% of the total land area of the region belongs to the province of Agusan del Sur. Of the total land area, 71.22% is forestland and 28.78% is <b>alienable</b> and disposable land. Major land uses include forestland comprising 31.36% and 23.98% of agricultural and open spaces.|$|E
25|$|In general, the alienable–inalienable {{distinction}} {{is an example}} of a binary possessive class system, i.e., a language in which two kinds of possession are distinguished (<b>alienable</b> and inalienable). The alienability {{distinction is}} the most common kind of binary possessive class system, but it is not the only one. Some languages have more than two possessive classes: the Anêm language of Papua New Guinea, for example, has at least 20 and Amele language has 32.|$|E
25|$|Alienability {{can only}} be {{expressed}} in attributive possession constructions, not in predicative possession. Attributive possession {{is a type of}} possession in which the possessor and possessee form a phrase. This contrasts to predicative possession constructions, in which the possessor and possessee are part of a clause and the verb affirms the possessive relationship. The examples in (21) express the same <b>alienable</b> relationship between possessor and possessee, but illustrate the difference between attributive and predicative possession.|$|E
25|$|Nouns are {{classified}} as either inalienably or alienably possessed, according to which possessive markers they occur with. Inalienably possessed nouns {{are those that are}} inherently possessed or nondetachable associations, specifically body parts and family members, opposed to alienably possessed nouns whose entity is not inherently possessed. This rule is not absolute as some body parts and kin nouns can be considered <b>alienable</b> and some nouns with close associations to its possessor (i.e. aasúu 'his house', isaashkakaáshi 'her dog') can be considered inalienable.|$|E
25|$|Haiman {{describes}} iconic {{expression and}} conceptual distance and how two concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect {{each other and}} cannot be separated from one another. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that {{the distance between the}} possessor and possessee in a sentence with <b>alienable</b> possession will be greater than it will be in sentences inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect this and {{there will not be a}} lot of distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would in turn increase their conceptual independence.|$|E
500|$|Mayan {{languages}} often contrast <b>alienable</b> and inalienable possession {{by varying}} {{the way the}} noun is (or is not) marked as possessed. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts inalienably possessed [...] "my photo (in which I am depicted)" [...] with alienably possessed [...] "my photo (taken by me)". The prefix we- marks the first person singular possessor in both, but {{the absence of the}} -e possessive suffix in the first form marks inalienable possession.|$|E
500|$|The single reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 20, 1910. The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "Here is a rather exaggerated farce with a good many laughs in it. It has for its basis recent cartoons, but has original treatment. The male members of the cast seemed to enjoy their roles, perhaps {{for the reason that}} it is a man's picture; the laugh seems on the ladies." [...] A more contemporary analysis of the film was covered in a paper by Eric Dewberry, who credits this film as Thanhouser's first film portraying suffragists. Dewberry writes that the film presents the idea of a woman mayor, something which was not farfetched for women to find to be humorous. Despite Jack's lack of power in the new era which he awakes to, he managed to win the heart of a powerful woman and easily restore the rights of men. Taken one way, the film seems to advance the idea that a women of power are controlled by their hearts. Dewing writes, [...] "On the one hand it mocks many female suffrage [...] "fighting tactics," [...] as suffragists, in an attempt to not appear too extremist and <b>alienable,</b> exploited conservative ideas of feminine virtue in order to assert their citizenship and reform desires. In the film, the man assumes effeminate passions to woo the Mayor. On the other hand, those sympathetic to the cause can see this as proof that these tactics can work in politics. The film also toys with the fears men harbored concerning the loss of power over females in public spaces, a threat to masculinity and manhood." [...] The film is also believed to have been the first adaptation of Curwood's work.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{language}} has separate <b>alienable</b> and inalienable possession constructions, {{and if one}} of these constructions is overtly marked whereas the other is [...] "zero-marked", the marked form tends to be <b>alienable</b> possession. Inalienable possession will be indicated {{by the absence of}} this overt marker. The data from Dâw are an example of this.|$|E
