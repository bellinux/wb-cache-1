2500|$|By April 1917, Diamandy {{had formed}} his own {{parliamentary}} party, called Labor Party (Partidul Muncei). It had the radical agrarianist Nicolae L.

Diamandy himself authored the central manifesto, published as a brochure.

He was [...] "evidently ridiculous", [...] "acutely megalomaniac", driven to [...] "a pathological state" [...] by {{the urgency of}} his heart disease. The Minister of Agriculture, Gheorghe Gh.

In 2010, Timberlake's manager, Johnny Wright, began conversations with the singer about working on new music.

Wright proposed a promotion based on an application or releasing a new song every month. Timberlake, however, was not interested in going back into music and instead continued to focus on his film career. Around the [...] "late part of May/first week in June" [...] 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last couple of nights in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling Billboard magazine that he [...] "wasn't prepared for that." [...] The two immediately began marketing plans for how the album should be promoted and when it should be released.
