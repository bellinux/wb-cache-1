5|$|Story and {{characters}} were a primary concern for Gilbert and Winnick. The pair based the game's cast on friends, family members, acquaintances, and stereotypes. For example, Winnick's girlfriend Ray was {{the inspiration for}} Razor, while Dave and Wendy were based, respectively, on Gilbert and a fellow Lucasfilm employee named Wendy. According to Winnick, the Edison family was shaped after characters from EC Comics and Warren Publishing magazines. The sentient meteor that brainwashes Dr. Fred {{was inspired by a}} segment from the 1982 anthology film Creepshow. A man-eating plant, similar to that of Little Shop of Horrors, was included as well. The developers sought {{to strike a balance between}} tension <b>and</b> <b>humor</b> with the game's story.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether there is a difference among prospective teachers in terms of humor styles, problem solving skills and self- esteem in regard to gender variable and whether there is a relation among humor styles, problem solving and self- esteem. The data of the study have been gathered through Humor Styles Scale, Problem Solving Inventory, Self- Esteem Scale and Personal Information Form. The sample of the study is composed of randomly selected 442 prospective teachers (251 female, 191 male) studying at various departments of Education Faculty of Selcuk University. Statistical analysis of the data has been carried out by independent t test and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. It is observed that there is not a significant difference between the average scores of affiliative <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> self-enhancing <b>humor</b> styles, when the humor styles of prospective teachers are analysed in regard to gender. However it is observed that the difference between the average scores of aggressive <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> self-defeating <b>humor</b> is significant. Moreover, a significant and positive relation has been observed between self- esteem and affiliative <b>and</b> self-enhancing <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> a significant and negative relation has been observed between self- esteem and aggressive <b>and</b> self-defeating <b>humor.</b> Through an increase of positive problem solving approach, self- esteem, affiliative <b>and</b> self-enhancing <b>humor</b> are also increasing and aggressive <b>and</b> self-defeating <b>humor</b> are decreasing...|$|R

5|$|The coyote {{features}} prominently as a trickster {{figure in}} the folktales of America's indigenous peoples, alternately assuming {{the form of an}} actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote acts as a picaresque hero which rebels against social convention through deception <b>and</b> <b>humor.</b> The coyote was likely given its trickster role in light of the actual animal's intelligence and adaptability; pre-Columbian American people observed its behavior, and their folkloric representations reflected its attributes. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike the gray wolf, which has undergone a radical improvement of its public image, cultural attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E

5|$|Though Fox was {{initially}} worried about an entire episode {{set in the}} other universe, they soon came to appreciate the storyline. The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes.

40|$|The <b>Humor</b> Styles Questionnaire <b>and</b> Interpersonal Reactivity Index {{were given}} to 103 (28 men, 75 women) {{undergraduates}} in a community college in the Midwestern United States.

5|$|Brahmashiva, {{the court}} poet of King Vikramaditya VI, earned the title Kavichakravarti ("Emperor among poets") from his patron for his writing Samayaparikshe ("Analysis of the doctrine", c.1125). In this {{philosophical}} writing, containing touches of propagandist satire <b>and</b> <b>humor,</b> the author seeks {{to prove the}} virtues of Jainism superior to all other contemporary religions. Brahmashiva portrays contemporary life and beliefs {{of the people of}} the Kannada-speaking region. He criticises Hinduism and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the Tirthankar Chandrapraba in Kholapur into a Hindu temple deifying the goddess Mahalakshmi. He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths. The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement. Prince Kirtivarma, a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI, wrote Govaidya ("Cattle Medicine"), the earliest available writing in Kannada on veterinary science, which mixes medicine and magic.|$|E
