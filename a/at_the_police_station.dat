40|$|Thesis (MA (Public and Development Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. In any {{organisation}} {{it is of}} {{the utmost}} importance that employees form part of the decisions made by management that influence them personally as well as those decisions that have an influence on their daily responsibilities. A sound principle that could be practised by managers to address this aspect is that of participative management. Although it will depend on the type of manager there is legislation in South Africa that forces managers to ensure that their personnel are managed in a participative manner. There are formal and informal methods to practice participative management in an organisation and certain factors that will have an influence on the successful implementation of this type of management style. In this research the focus will be on participative management <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Metropole, Western Cape as well as a benchmarking with <b>the</b> <b>police</b> departments in Wyoming, United States of America. The methods that will be used to gather information to evaluate participative management will entail a questionnaire that has to be completed by <b>the</b> employees <b>at</b> <b>the</b> identified <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> and personal interviews with the individual Station Commissioners and Chiefs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> departments in Wyoming. The analysis in relation to the questionnaires, interviews and literature review has been used by the researcher to formulate the findings and recommendations. The employees who work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Metropole are satisfied with the amount of responsibility and accountability that is delegated to them by the management. The employees are therefore adequately empowered to render a professional service to their respective clients. There is a need for <b>the</b> management <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Metropole to improve on the following: {{to make use of the}} ideas, talents and suggestions of employees; to obtain commitment from employees before embarking on a course of action; to utilize the ideas on how to solve problems and improve service delivery by employees; the identifying of critical outputs and goals by the employees for their work, although the Performance Enhancement Process has ensured the opportunity it seems that the negotiation of the outputs in the individual performance plans of employees still need improvement; to create a working environment where employees are treated as stakeholders and democracy is enhanced by means of participative management; and the dispute settlement between management and unions. That <b>the</b> management <b>at</b> station level: do not always consult with employees in relation to decisions that affect them; and there are not always opportunities created for employees to participate in decisionmaking. The legislation and collective agreements that relate to participative management in the SAPS are not always adhered to by <b>the</b> management <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Metropole, Western Cape. Shop stewards should get more involved at station level in the representation of their respective employees. Participative management is being practised <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Metropole, but there is a need for the improvement thereof. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> departments in Wyoming do not have legislative prescriptions to formal participative management as <b>the</b> <b>Police</b> Service of South Africa. The organisational The informal methods used in Wyoming to practice participative management are very similar to that of South Africa, despite the fact that there is no legislation or prescriptions to the adherence thereof. The researcher is of the humble opinion that a clear policy in relation to the practice of participative management in <b>police</b> organisations at <b>station</b> level should be compiled that will incorporate existing legislation and collective agreements in the SAPS as well as the methods to practice participative management. The shop stewards that represent their employees <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Metropole, Western Cape should be sensitised on their role and responsibilities. Managers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>stations</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Metropole, Western Cape should again be sensitised on the legislation and collective agreements that relate to participative management and that a suggestion box, quality circles and a participative management forum be implemented at station level...|$|R
