25|$|It {{is alleged}} {{sometime}} around or after 4pm, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator {{of the nearby}} Drexel Building, at 319 South Main Street, to use the top-floor restroom, which was restricted to blacks. He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. The two likely knew each other at least by sight, as this building {{was the only one}} nearby with a restroom which Rowland had express permission to use, and the elevator operated by Page {{was the only one in}} the building. A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store located on the first floor of the Drexel, heard what sounded like a woman's scream and saw <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> rushing from the building.

Entertainment Weeklys Matt Diehl calls Method Man's and Redman's lyrics [...] "misogynistic", {{adding that it}} upsets Voodoos [...] "organically sensual vibe". The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it [...] "could be about his MIA status ('Will I hang or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it's up to God'), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence ('I'm gonna {{put my finger on}} the trigger/I'm gonna pull it, and then we gon' see/What the deal/I'm for real')". Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E
500|$|Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance (1993) {{observed}} that in Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson represents a [...] "modern good fairy" [...] attempting to guide troubled youth {{to a more}} positive way of life. Each of the three segments serve a different purpose, beginning with affinity and companionship in [...] "Miss You Much", followed by anger and frustration in her rooftop solo and ending with [...] "Rhythm Nation", in which Jackson and her dancers [...] "have become a uniformed, formidable army, whose controlled energetic moves and shouts project a disciplined resolution to inspire others through dance and music." [...] Their group dynamic visually depicts a gender neutral equality, with Jackson [...] "performing asexually and anonymously in front of, but {{as one of the}} members of the group." [...] It is also noted that the success of the film is not only the final product, but in the commercial and social implications of its development. In selecting an unknown street dancer, Anthony Thomas, to develop her choreography, [...] "Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement: she satisfies the dictates of the commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work; she demonstrates that, despite fame, she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions; and finally, she , not the dance traditions of Hollywood musical... but the work of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro-American cultural expression of the late 1980s." [...] The film received positive reception. Jefferson Graham in USA Today commented that [...] "she dances up a storm in the moody black-and-white video's three songs... and plays the role of a mystical figure to young kids." [...] Jon Pareles remarked that [...] " [...] juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams." [...] It was later released on VHS as the Rhythm Nation 1814 Compilation, and reissued the following year with each of the album's promotional music videos. Jackson received two MTV Music Video Award nominations for [...] "Best Dance Video" [...] and [...] "Best Choreography" [...] for [...] "Rhythm Nation", winning the latter.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{influential}} African American {{of the nineteenth}} century, Douglass {{made a career of}} agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle.

The Kittredges are trying to get the money to buy a painting by Paul Cézanne and now have this wounded stranger in their home. Paul claims he is in New York to meet his father, who is directing a film version of the Broadway musical Cats.

In one of the early episodes, the Jeffersons move into a house down the block from the Bunkers (later, the house is said to be next door).
