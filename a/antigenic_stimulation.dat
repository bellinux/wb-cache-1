40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus/simian {{immunodeficiency virus}} (SIV) diversification {{is a direct}} consequence of viral replication and occurs principally in secondary lymphoid organs where CD 4 (+) T cells are activated and proliferate. However, the evolution of viral quasispecies may also be driven by various nonexclusive mechanisms, including adaptation to specific immune responses and modification of viral fitness. Analysis of viral quasispecies in SIV-infected macaques subjected to repeated <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> allowed us to demonstrate transient expansions of SIV populations that were highly dependent upon activation of antigen-specific T cells. T-cell clones expanded in response to a particular antigen were infected by a specific viral population and persisted for prolonged periods. Upon a second stimulation by encounter with the same antigen, these specific genomes were at the origin of a new burst of replication, leading to rapid but transient replacement of the viral quasispecies in blood.

In some instances, however, marked hyperplasia accompanied with structural alteration (2 ̆ 2 Splenoides Mark 2 ̆ 2) is followed by fibrillosis and fibrosis even in the earlier stage (4 rabbits, 39, 108, 120, and 236 days). Extensive or pathy inflammatory exudation and following fibrosis also appear in the course of prolonged sensitization (6 rabbits, 40, 83, 114, 118, 164, and 232 days). Besides these fibrosing processes, there occures focal fibrosis in the organization of anemic infarction of bone and myeloid tissue due to thrombotic angitis (4 rabbits, 80, 95, 160, arid 238 days).

The results indicate that a serologic population profile may provide an indication of the history and status of malaria. Technical aspects of the IHA test are reviewed; it may be desirable to use homologous antigens instead of a simian Plasmodium antigen. To obtain the most useful additional epidemiological information about a malaria situation, serologic data need to be age-related, and longitudinal surveys are usually more informative than a cross-sectional survey...|$|R
40|$|Failure to {{generate}} CTL responses in early {{life has been}} linked to the preferential maturation of CD 4 T cells into TH 2 rather than TH 1 cells in response to some, but not other, <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulations.</b> Here, we provide preliminary evidence for the role of the viral replication pattern in the shaping of neonatal cellular responses to live viral vaccines. Neonatal and early life immunization with live attenuated Sendai virus vaccine led to the induction of IgG 2 a antibodies and cytotoxic responses as efficiently as immunization of adult animals. Similarly, although early life immunization with live attenuated measles virus led to preferential TH 2 polarization of T cells compared with adult primed animals, it allowed the induction of CTL responses which had not been observed following immunization with a live recombinant canarypox vector. Thus, conversely to a non-replicating canarypox recombinant vaccine expressing the measles haemagglutonin, viral vaccines with limited but present replication capacity appear capable of activating neonatal antigen presenting cells to trigger TH 1 and CTL responses, as recently observed for DNA vaccines...|$|R

[...] In fact, the severity of asthma can {{be determined by the}} elevated titres to C. pneumoniae, but not to other potential pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenovirus, influenza A and B or parainfluenza virus. [...] It is hypothesized that C. pneumoniae is associated with asthma because C. pneumoniae has been found to cause ciliostasis in bronchial epithelial cells. [...] Meanwhile, sero-epidemiological data also provide evidences to support that C. pneumoniae plays a role in asthma by amplifying inflammation and inciting the disease process. [...] The association of C. pneumoniae and asthma begins with C. pneumoniae producing 60-kDa heat shock proteins that provide a prolonged <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulation.</b> [...] This particular heat shock protein is known as a member of hsp60 family of stress proteins, which can be found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The production of hsp60 remains unaltered even when C. pneumoniae is dormant and does not replicate, since that hsp60 serves as a protective antigen. [...] Its <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> strongly amplifies chronic inflammation by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ by infected cells, which ultimately leads to immunopathological tissue damage and scarring in the asthmatic lungs.

We analyzed the tissue distribution of the immune interferon-producing cells (IIPC) which appeared in various lymphoid organs after allogeneic stimulation. Although fluid from cocultures of L-cell-sensitized thymocytes and L-cells could not detect interferon activity consistently, small numbers of IIPC could be detected by using the enumeration method of IIPC.

Multiple <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> were more effective and induced longer-lasting immune interferon production than a single stimulation.

40|$|Most gut intraepithelial cells (IEL) of {{the mouse}} are T cells that bear CD 8 molecules, present either as alpha-beta chain heterodimers (CD 8 beta+) or as alpha chain homodimers (CD 8 beta-). All CD 8 beta+ IEL bear alpha/beta T cell receptors (TCR); CD 8 beta- IEL bear either alpha/beta or gamma/delta TCR and are {{considered}} to be a thymus-independent (TI) population, probably arising locally from a small fraction of CD 3 - IEL containing the recombinant activating gene RAG proteins. Here we report that TI CD 8 beta- IEL, whether bearing alpha/beta or gamma/delta TCR, contain, in normal mice, mRNAs for both zeta and Fc epsilon RI gamma chains. These chains are present in their CD 3 -TCR complexes as homo- or heterodimers. In contrast, only zeta chain mRNA and homodimers are found in gut CD 8 alpha/beta+ IEL and in peripheral T lymphocytes. Intestinal CD 3 - precursor cells contain only gamma chain, and CD 3 - IL- 2 R+ thymocyte precursors only zeta chain mRNAs. Only very primitive thymocyte precursors contain detectable gamma chain mRNA, and it thus appears that Fc epsilon RI gamma chain use is switched off at a very early stage during thymocyte differentiation. Thus, T cell differentiation in the gut epithelium differs from that occurring in the thymus, from which CD 8 beta+ IEL appear to derive. Use of different TCR transducing modules and CD 8 accessory molecules between the TI and the thymus-derived T cell populations provides an explanation for their difference in reactivity to <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> and thus in selection of repertoires...|$|R

No effects were observed using other fungal cell wall components such as glucan or alkali-acid treated glucomannan. The highest CMC level was detected after 7 - 10 days of PBMC incubation {{in the presence}} of 50 micrograms/ml of whole Candida cells and the cytotoxic immunoeffectors elicited by these <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> equally affected NK-susceptible (K 562) and NK-resistant (Raji, Daudi and Jurkat) tumor cell lines. Both Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) were produced by GMP-stimulated PBMC, the IL- 2 peak production constantly preceding that of IFN production. GMP-induced generation of natural CMC was potentiated by the addition of IFN-gamma and a monospecific anti IFN-gamma serum totally abrogated both IFN activity and CMC generation. The cytolytic effectors were shown to be OKT 3 -, OKT 8 - and HLA-DR-. They did not possess typical NK markers (e. g. Leu- 7 and AB 8. 28) but were partially recognized by A 10, a IgG 2 a monoclonal antibody reacting to PBMC-NK lymphocytes and activated T cells. These results suggest that the antitumor cytolytic effectors generated in PBMC cultures exposed to Candida material belong either to a discrete subset of natural effectors lacking classical NK markers or to other lymphokine-activated cells.

Such findings have suggested that cells in the suppressor lineage may be particularly sensitive to this alkylating agent. The experiments reported here demonstrate that a single injection of CY before sensitization can induce a long-lasting state of enhanced DTH responsiveness to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in mice. This enhancement required concurrent <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulation</b> {{and appeared to be}} antigen-specific. Additionally, CY treatment of sensitized mice before the first antigenic challenge for DTH resulted in suppressed responses to that challenge, followed by enhanced DTH to subsequent challenge with the same antigen. The suppressed response was achieved with a lower dose of CY than the subsequent enhancement and also required concurrent <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulation.</b> These results indicate that the effects of CY on both effector and suppressor mechanisms are critically dependent upon <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulation,</b> and suggest that apparent suppressor sensitivity to CY may be a function of differential ability to recover from CY treatment in a context of <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Total-body X-irradiation {{has been}} shown to {{suppress}} ~mmune responses to a large variety of <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> (1), followed, in the case of sublethal doses, by gradual spontaneous recovery. It has been demonstrated that such a spontaneous recovery may not be manifest if thymectomy precedes irradiation (2 [...] 4). Experiments using thymus grafts (4 - 6) or thymuses placed within diffusion chambers (7) indicated that the thymus might influence this recovery by the liberation of humoral factors. Although the idea of humoral factor activity has been repeatedly stated by various groups for radiation recovery {{as well as for the}} normal development in the neonate (8 - 11), its mechanism of action is still obscure. Several suggestions can be made to explain the process of thymus activity; e. g. the thymus may activate cells residing in the lymphoid-depleted (or immature) organs, or it may activate stem cells to migrate and develop in these tissues. However, humoral activity of the thymus may reflect only a part of its role in the immune system (cf. references 12 and 13). For example, circulation of lymphoid cells between lymphoid organs (14) provides an additional factor to be considered in studies on the mechanism of the thymus effect and for identification of the tissue origin of immunocompetent cells in a regenerating system. The recent development of methods for induction of immune responses in vitro (15 - 17) and particularly the graft versus host response (17) enabled a direct approach to a study of reactivation of immunocompetence in isolated individual organs, and thus to trace the tissue origin of the competent cells and to follow the mechanism of the thymus effect.

40|$|During {{the last}} 15 years, virologic and {{immunologic}} studies {{have provided a}} series of valuable clues on the modalities of gamma-herpesvirus-induced oncogenesis, which do not only consist of the direct subversion of intracellular signaling pathways, leading to a frank neoplastic molecular network in the infected cell, but also rely on viral manipulations of the cellular and cytokine microenvironment, especially in conditions of immunodeficiency in the host. At the virus-host interface, something iniquitous, strikingly favoring the aggressive expansion of human herpesvirus 8 -infected lympho-endothelial clones, known as Kaposi's sarcoma, often occurs in different types of immunocompromised patients, able to establish a deleterious "pro-Kaposi's sarcoma" neo-angiogenic inflammatory network. However, these patients may control - or even resolve - the neoplastic burden as soon as an immunologic reassessment restores functional anti-Kaposi's sarcoma immune responses and reconstitutes a proper inflammatory environment. Indeed, the occurrence of iatrogenic Kaposi's sarcoma remissions, after the reduction or switch of immunosuppressive regimens, strongly suggests that the reset of immunologic constraints characterizing the Kaposi's sarcoma onco-pathogenic system may be sufficient to inhibit human herpesvirus 8 -positive lympho-endothelial proliferations. Accordingly, immunologic reports all underline the pivotal protective role of anti-human herpesvirus 8 memory T-cells (harmonically, both CD 8 + and CD 4 + subsets), thus definitely implying a general requirement for an effective, antiviral immuno-inflammatory environment, based on correct and productive interactions between different compartments of dendritic, myeloid, and specific T-cells, {{in order to achieve}} and maintain optimal control on human herpesvirus 8 -associated <b>antigenic</b> <b>stimulations</b> and Kaposi's sarcoma disease. In this review, we recapitulate some remarkable features about the outstanding immunologic issue raised by human herpesvirus 8 -driven neoplastic outgrowths in immunodeficient patients, and in particular, we discuss the emerging view of Kaposi's sarcoma as an atypical neoplastic process, tightly dependent on immune system dynamics. It is conceivable that functional dissection of the specific immune responses, capable to cope with human herpesvirus 8, and further definitions of a global inflammatory profile with protective activity against Kaposi's sarcoma outbreaks, will eventually foster immunologic monitoring protocols during the follow-up of AIDS and posttransplant patients, either preventing or treating human herpesvirus 8 -related tumors by multifunctional immunomodulation or prompt development of adoptive immunotherapeutic approaches...|$|R

Inability of primed CTL to differentiate to mature CTL in the spleen might be explained by the effect of splenic suppressor cells, since mature CTL became detectable in the spleen of immune mice by treatment with cyclophosphamide...|$|R
