Michael Schumacher blamed his brother for instigating the move and did not {{understand}} why he was upset over the incident. Ralf Schumacher did not comment and stated that he would watch a video of the incident before he would say anything. Their father, Rolf talked to the pair {{in an effort to}} get them reconciled. One week after the race, Ralf Schumacher said that tensions between him and his brother had eased and that there were no hard feelings for each other, saying, [...] "It's a lot of fun when we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on the track duelling against each other."

While Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero II are fully backward-compatible through the hardware PlayStation 2 emulation {{in the initial}} North American release of the console, it was impossible at launch to use the guitar controller to play either game. Kai Huang, of RedOctane, states that they are [...] "working on that with Sony right now – looking at how we can get all the PlayStation 2 guitars that <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and all the owners of them, to use them on the PlayStation 3." [...] Nyko, an accessories company, was poised to make a special PlayStation 2 controller adapter for the PlayStation 3, but put the product on hold due to technical difficulties. Tac, another accessories company, also made a PlayStation 2 controller adapter for a PlayStation 3 game console so players could use their Guitar Hero guitar controllers that were made for the PlayStation 2 with a PlayStation 3. However, the May 2007 PlayStation 3 V1.80 system update has made the guitar controller compatible with generic PlayStation 2 controller to USB adapters when playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero II. In addition, Pelican Accessories has released a special controller adapter that supports both games, including the ability to switch the handedness of the guitar.|$|E

Existing games may receive updates to provide enhancements or additional 4K support for Xbox One X. Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow-up interview that he was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be [...] "up to the game development community what do they want to do." [...] Spencer also touted that Xbox One X's hardware could also be used to support virtual reality, noting that especially at a console price point, [...] "having something at six teraflops that will get millions of people buying it is very attractive to some of the VR companies that <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> already, and we've architected it such that something will be able to plug right in and work."

They believed that Stewart's efforts to release communications from her client were part of an appropriate defense method to gain public awareness and support. They also expressed alarm that wiretaps and hidden cameras authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were used by the government to gather evidence against her, which they called a violation of attorney–client privilege. George Soros' Open Society Institute also donated $20,000 to Stewart's legal defense fund in 2002.

The event offered opportunities for men to have health checks with experienced staff from Action Cancer, and speakers such as Ken Harland (University of Ulster's Centre of Young Men's studies), Peter Mc Donald, a senior child care worker from Giggles Daycare nursery, and local athlete Ronan Murtagh shared their own insight into the choices young men make and the opportunities that <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> for young men today.

[...] Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors' mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, an attitude that upset the Australian: [...] "He really does say some funny things at the wrong time", said Rafter, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> busting our guts and he doesn't show a lot of respect {{at the end of the}} day.

[...] Following Rafter's successful defense of his 1997 U.S. Open title by defeating Mark Philippoussis in the 1998 final, when asked about Sampras' earlier comments about having to win another Grand Slam in order to be considered great, Rafter replied: [...] "Maybe you can ask him that question, if he thinks that now. For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn't sunk in yet. It's very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it". For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, [...] "When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off." [...] Rafter responded by calling Sampras a “cry baby” and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1.|$|E
