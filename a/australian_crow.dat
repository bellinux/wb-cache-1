5|$|Gregory Mathews {{described}} the western subspecies perplexus in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting {{that it was}} smaller than the nominate subspecies.

In the same work he listed the raven as Corvus marianae, with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its range as New South Wales. He listed the little raven and forest raven as subspecies. Mathews had erected C. marianae in 1911 as the name after declaring Corvus australis Gould to be preoccupied; French-American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black nunbird—to preserve the stability of the name.

500|$|The Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) is a {{passerine}} bird in {{the genus}} Corvus native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring [...] in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the <b>Australian</b> <b>crow</b> species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white irises, younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow (C. corone).

50|$|The true currawongs are {{a little}} larger than the Australian magpie, smaller than the ravens (except {{possibly}} the little raven, which is only slightly larger on average), but broadly similar in appearance. They are easily distinguished by their yellow eyes, {{in contrast to the}} red eyes of a magpie and white eyes of <b>Australian</b> <b>crows</b> and ravens. Currawongs are also characterised by the hooked tips of their long, sharply pointed beaks.They are not as terrestrial as the magpie and have shorter legs. They are omnivorous, foraging in foliage, on tree trunks and limbs, and on the ground, taking insects and larvae (often dug out from under the bark of trees), fruit, and the nestlings of other birds. They are distinguishable from magpies and crows by their comical flight style in amongst foliage, appearing to almost fall about from branch to branch as if they were inept flyers.|$|R

50|$|Trapping is a {{rarely used}} {{technique}} in the U.S., but {{is being used}} with success in parts of Europe and Australia. The ladder-style trap (e.g., <b>Australian</b> <b>Crow</b> Trap or Modified <b>Australian</b> <b>Crow</b> Trap) {{seems to be the}} most effective in crow-trapping techniques. Ladder traps are constructed {{in such a way that}} unintentional catch of nontarget species is avoided. If a nontarget species is caught, it can be easily released without harm to the bird. The traps are cost-efficient because they are inexpensive and simple to construct, and require little manpower to monitor. The bait used in the traps can also be specific to corvids. Carrion, grains, unshelled raw peanuts, and shiny objects in the trap are effective baits. When removing crows from a ladder trap, one living crow is left as an extremely effective decoy for other crows. Trapping is considered the most humane method for crow removal because the crows can be relocated without harm or stress. However, most wild birds in general have a knack for returning to their home ranges.|$|E
500|$|Many species prey on {{the cane}} toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat, {{including}} the broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), the banded cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira annulata), [...] eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the rock flagtail (Kuhlia rupestris), some species of catfish (order Siluriformes), some species of ibis (subfamily Threskiornithinae), and Paraponera clavata (bullet ants). Predators outside the cane toad's native range include the whistling kite (Haliastur sphenurus), the rakali (Hydromys chrysogaster), the black rat (Rattus rattus) {{and the water}} monitor (Varanus salvator). The tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) and the Papuan frogmouth (Podargus papuensis) have been reported as feeding on cane toads; some <b>Australian</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus spp.) have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the Didelphis genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let their toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad.|$|R

50|$|Most prey is {{captured}} {{on the ground}} in gliding attacks or (less frequently) in the air. Choice of prey is very much a matter of convenience and opportunity; since the arrival of Europeans, the introduced rabbit and brown hare have become the primary items of the eagle's diet in many areas.

Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true <b>crows,</b> <b>Australian</b> magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class.

40|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{being carried out}} by Denver Wildlife Research Center {{personnel}} on starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and blackbirds {{as part of a}} research program to alleviate damage by these species. The objectives are to determine the breeding and wintering areas, migratory routes, local movement patterns, and turnover rates of problem populations. Knowledge about the movement of problem birds is essential for determining those points in their daily and seasonal movement cycles where {{they are likely to be}} more vulnerable to control. Banding and marking programs are presently the primary means of gathering movement data. Since 1960, Denver personnel and cooperators have banded nearly 200, 000 starlings and blackbirds in Arizona, Nevada, California, Colorado, Oregon, South Dakota, and North Dakota. About 60, 000 of these birds were also color-tagged with leg streamers to increase the normally low recovery rate of starlings and blackbirds and to provide data on the feeding, movement, and roosting patterns of local populations. The most successful and efficient trapping technique used to capture these birds was the use of bait traps such as the modified <b>Australian</b> <b>crow</b> trap and the decoy trap used successfully by Patuxent Research Center biologists. Use of long-handled dip-nets in frozen marsh roosts at night and cannon nets and chemical soporifics in feeding and preroosting areas also resulted in thousands of banded birds.

40|$|Airports in {{southern}} California {{have experienced a}} number of damaging bird strikes associated with raptors during the last 10 years, including two substantially damaging strikes involving red-tailed hawks. Southern California airfield habitats attract a large variety of small birds and rodents, especially California ground squirrels and pocket gophers, which attract red-tailed hawks and other predators into aircraft movement areas. Effective, publically acceptable methods to reduce prey populations and/or reduce raptor use of airport habitats are needed. Over a 14 -month period during 2006 - 2007, body grip traps and gas cartridges were used to remove 927 California ground squirrels from one airfield. Monthly raptor observations were directly correlated with the reduction in ground squirrels. Red-tailed hawk observations were reduced by 47 % and ground squirrels capture rates were reduced by 98 % after ground squirrel management efforts were undertaken. Swedish goshawk traps (SGT) and <b>Australian</b> <b>crow</b> traps (ACT) positioned in areas utilized by hunting raptors (e. g., between the runways) were used to live-capture and relocate a variety of raptors from 3 southern California airports (from August 2006 through April 2008), consisting of: (Airport # 1) 2 BAOW, 1 GHOW, and 16 RTHA; (Airport # 2) 1 AMKE, 1 COHA, and 18 RTHA, and; (Airport # 3) 9 RTHA and 9 COHA. Effective use of SGT required modifications to trap location and use of bait and decoys (e. g., a live rock pigeon secured below the perch mechanism). The ACT required the action of Airfield Operations to close the trap door once a raptor was observed inside of the trap. Modifications to ACTs increased trapping efficiency. Prey reduction and raptor trapping methods (SGT and ACT) are effective wildlife mitigation tools acceptable {{to the public for}} the live-capture and relocation of raptors, allowing for reduced risk of raptor-aircraft collisions at airports {{in southern}} California and elsewhere...|$|E
