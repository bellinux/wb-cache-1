5|$|Alexander {{was also}} noted for his {{nepotism}} that was partially {{due to his}} <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> and belief that his family would have little time to profit from his reign.

5|$|During the 1848 revolution, San Martin left Paris {{and moved}} to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a small city in {{northern}} France. He was almost blind and had many health problems because of his <b>advanced</b> <b>age,</b> but continued to write letters and {{keep in touch with}} the news from South America. Shortly after receiving the news of the Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, three o'clock on 17 August 1850.|$|E

5|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{is rare in}} otherwise healthy, well-nourished individuals. It {{can occur}} in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total parenteral nutrition, and in those of <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> (over 90).

Although New Zealand soil has low levels of selenium, adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents.|$|E
5|$|Several older star {{players who}} were left unprotected, {{including}} Danny Tartabull, Jack Morris, and Shawon Dunston, were not selected due to their high salaries and <b>advanced</b> <b>age.</b> Based {{on the results of}} the expansion draft, the Marlins were projected to have a higher payroll in 1993 than the Rockies.

We found that work history was modestly related to some measures of health. We also found that childhood health and socioeconomic status were correlated with health even at <b>advanced</b> <b>ages.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine this connection in developing countries and at such <b>advanced</b> <b>ages.</b> Aging, oldest-old, longevity...|$|R

5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule.

Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do display a cross.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the walls}} of the chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. They were {{forgotten}} until its rediscovery in 1958. Due to their historical significance, an international search was conducted to locate the original painter in helping to restore the damaged and faded murals. Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. He made three trips to Singapore between 1963 and 1988 to restore his former paintings. Due to Stanley's <b>advanced</b> <b>age,</b> only four of the original murals were fully restored. In the 1990s, the former site of the murals was gazetted as a Heritage Site by the National Heritage Board of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Anna Mary Robertson Moses (September 7, 1860 – December 13, 1961), {{known by}} her {{nickname}} Grandma Moses, was an American folk artist. She began painting in earnest {{at the age}} of 78 and is often cited as an example of an individual who successfully began a career in the arts at an <b>advanced</b> <b>age.</b> Her works have been shown and sold in the United States and abroad and have been marketed on greeting cards and other merchandise. Moses' paintings are displayed in the collections of many museums. The Sugaring Off was sold for US $1.2 million in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 France began a {{blockade}} of the Rio de la Plata against Rosas. San Martín offered his military services to Rosas, which was declined because of San Martín's <b>advanced</b> <b>age,</b> and condemned {{the role of}} the unitarians in that conflict, as they had allied themselves with France against their own nation. San Martín bequeathed his curved saber to Rosas, because of his successful defense of the country. The conflict between France and Argentina renewed in the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata, which San Martín condemned as well. During this time he met Florencio Varela and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that Menem was {{under investigation for}} his role in the 1995 Río Tercero explosion, which is alleged to have been part of the weapons scandal involving Croatia and Ecuador. Following an Appeals Court ruling that found Menem guilty of aggravated smuggling, he was sentenced to seven years in prison on June 13, 2013, {{for his role in}} illegally smuggling weapons to Ecuador and Croatia; his position as senator earned him immunity from incarceration, and his <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> (82) afforded him the possibility of house arrest. His minister of defense during the weapons sales, Oscar Camilión, was concurrently sentenced to five and a half years.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to 2008, {{there was no}} organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF. The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred 2008's election {{so as not to}} undermine its credibility, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to vote for the party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1861, when Rainilaiarivony was 33 years old, Queen Ranavalona's <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> and acute illness {{produced}} speculation about who would succeed her. Ranavalona had repeatedly stated her intention that her progressive and pro-European son, RadamaII, would be her successor, much {{to the chagrin of}} the conservative faction at court. The conservatives privately rallied behind the queen's nephew and adoptive son Ramboasalama, whom the queen had initially declared heir apparent some years prior, and who had never abandoned hope to one day reclaim the right that had briefly been accorded to him.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{appeals for}} Hess's release were {{launched}} by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, beginning {{as early as}} 1947. These were denied, mainly because the Soviets repeatedly vetoed the proposal. Spandau was located in West Berlin, and its existence gave the Soviets a foothold in that sector of the city. Additionally, Soviet officials believed Hess must have known in 1941 that an attack on their country was imminent. In 1967 Wolf Rüdiger Hess began a campaign to win his father's release, garnering support from notable politicians such as Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey in Britain and Willy Brandt in Germany, but to no avail, {{in spite of the}} prisoner's <b>advanced</b> <b>age</b> and deteriorating health.|$|E

40|$|Given that {{mortality}} risks at <b>advanced</b> <b>ages</b> (over 85) due to circulatory diseases {{have decreased}} recently {{and that it}} is likely that the effects of risk factors change with age, it is important to study the age dynamics of circulatory disease and circulatory risk factors in elderly populations. Analysis of chronic disease risks, however, is complicated at <b>advanced</b> <b>ages</b> because of the prominence of natural age increases in risk and the rapid rate at which health status changes at those ages. As a consequence, to identify the effects of putative risk factors at <b>advanced</b> <b>ages</b> one must employ appropriate analytic procedures to isolate risk factor effects from aging dynamics. Special risk assessment procedures developed to represent age-related biological processes are applied to an analysis of circulatory disease risk in a study population with a mean age at study entry of over 70 years — the first Duke University Longitudinal Study of Aging population. Key Words: Circulatory disease, Risk factors, Longitudinal aging studies, Dynamic analysis, Sex differentials ALTHOUGH there have been numerous studies • of the relation between putative risk factors and circulatory disease risk for middle-aged populations, there are relatively few such studies of populations at <b>advanced</b> <b>ages.</b> This paucity o...|$|R
