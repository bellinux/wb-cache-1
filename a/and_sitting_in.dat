At the same time, hundreds of acres of working class and artisan homes were built, especially in the south and east of the city. To support the growing population, public service buildings such as the Beaufort Hospital (now Glenside), schools such as Clifton College and public houses such as the Mauretania Public House were constructed.|$|E
5|$|The fatwa {{reaffirmed the}} {{obligation}} of Spanish Muslims to perform the ritual prayers (salat), the ritual charity (zakat), and the ritual ablution (ghusl), {{even if they could}} not be performed in the correct form. It described {{the obligation of}} the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, prostrating, <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a prescribed sequenceeven if done only by making slight movements. The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Upon his return, Edge {{began to}} show some villainous {{characteristics}} centering on his obsession for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday in October 2004. Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot, giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot. During the match, an angry Edge abandoned his partner (although Benoit managed to win the title on his own) and instead interfered in the main event, costing Michaels the championship. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Edge and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship with Edge abandoning Benoit again <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a chair and watching the match. After {{the conclusion of the}} match, Edge attacked Benoit, officially turning heel {{for the first time since}} 2001. Edge then adopted a drastically different gimmick, becoming a crazed and brash villain in the process. At Survivor Series, Edge was part of Team Triple H along with Triple H, Batista and Snitsky. They were defeated by Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven). During the match, Edge eliminated both Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho before getting eliminated by Randy Orton.|$|E

25|$|The other 12th-century window, {{perhaps the}} most famous at Chartres, is the {{so-called}} « Notre-Dame de la Belle-Verrière », found in the first bay of the choir after the south transept. This window is actually a composite; the upper part, showing the Virgin and child surrounded by adoring angels, dates from around 1180 and was probably positioned at the centre of the apse in the earlier building. The Virgin is depicted wearing a blue robe <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a frontal pose on a throne, with the Christ Child seated on her lap raising his hand in blessing. This composition, known as the Sedes sapientia ('Throne of Wisdom'), which also appears on the Portail royal, is based on the famous cult figure kept in the crypt. The lower part of the window, showing scenes from the Infancy of Christ, dates from the main glazing campaign around 1225.|$|E
25|$|Parma's stay in Serie B started badly under Luca Cagni, who {{was sacked}} six games {{into the season}} and {{replaced}} by Francesco Guidolin who guided the club to joint top at the half-way mark and a second-place finish, ending the season unbeaten at home and fired on with goals from Alberto Paloschi and Cristiano Lucarelli, finally securing promotion back to Serie A with a 2–2 draw on 16 May 2009 with two games left to play. Parma went on to finish the season in second place, 4 points behind eventual winners Bari. Parma's return to Serie A in 2009–10 started with good form, winning eight of the first sixteen matches <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> fourth position before Christmas, as Daniele Galloppa became the first Parma player to represent Italy in over three years, the longest period without Parma representation since Alberto Di Chiara became the first to play for Italy in 1992. Although Parma's form dropped off in the new year, despite the re-signing of fans' favourite Hernán Crespo they did manage to finish eighth in the final standings, narrowly missing out on qualification for the Europa League, just three points behind rivals Juventus. Head coach Guidolin's contract was not renewed and he left for Udinese, swapping posts with Parma's newly appointed Pasquale Marino {{in the summer of}} 2010.|$|E

The morning of the combat saw thousands of Parisians arriving at the Abbey at dawn, long before the appointed hour.
