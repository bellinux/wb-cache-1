5|$|Though it {{had large}} {{nostrils}} and a fleshy snout, Nigersaurus had an underdeveloped olfactory region of its brain and thus {{did not have}} an advanced sense of smell. Its brain-to-body-mass ratio was average for a reptile, and smaller than those of ornithischians and non-coelurosaurian theropods. The cerebrum comprised about 30% of the brain volume, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> other dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Another global field model, called World Magnetic Model, is {{produced}} {{jointly by the}} United States National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the British Geological Survey. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the United States Department of Defense, the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Office as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> civilian navigation systems.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> other African societies, prebendalism {{and high}} rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> other ISSF events, {{the target}} for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows {{a contrast to}} that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E

Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, {{a second}} wave of the punk rock {{movement}} was breaking in the three countries where it had emerged, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> other places. Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E
5|$|Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther {{proposed}} {{reform to}} the Church, {{often based on}} humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517 Luther published the 95 Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, {{particularly with regard to}} instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.|$|E

5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> of those less developed.|$|E
5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides a civilization through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the upper}} and lower masseteric ridges come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E

5|$|St. Louis {{suffered}} {{as much or}} more than comparable cities {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. Manufacturing output fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent, and output remained low until World War II. Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis was no exception (see table). Black workers in St. Louis, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than their white counterparts. To aid the unemployed, the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E
