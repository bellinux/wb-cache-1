40|$|A clear sailing {{agreement}} (or clause) is a compromise {{in which a}} class action defendant agrees not to contest the class lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s petition for attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees. This Article argues that clear sailing provisions often facilitate collusive settlements in cases involving non-pecuniary relief or claims-made common funds that return all unclaimed monies to the defendant. Because these types of settlements present difficult valuation problems, trial courts lack a clear benchmark for calculating attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees. Defendants and class can exploit this uncertainty by presenting an inflated settlement value to the court (to justify higher attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees) while simultaneously reducing the true cost imposed on the defendant. Although courts purportedly apply 2 ̆ 2 heightened scrutiny 2 ̆ 2 to settlements involving clear {{sailing agreement}}s, this approach rarely threatens the underlying settlement. As a result, clear sailing agreements tend to undermine the deterrence function of class action by producing settlements that are systemically too low. This Article proposes a per se ban on settlements that rely upon clear sailing provisions. In addition, this Article recommends the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>guardian</b> ad litem to litigate the issue of attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees in all cases involving non-pecuniary relief or a claims-made reverter fund...|$|E

The concept of a diagnosable “Parental Alienation Syndrome” (“PAS”) developed as an attempt to explain this phenomenon, but it has been widely discredited by mental health professionals and thus fails the standard for evidentiary admissibility. Nevertheless, PAS and related theories continue to influence the decisions of family courts, and even in jurisdictions that explicitly reject such theories, judges still face the daunting task of resolving these volatile cases. In the midst of this highly adversarial process, children deserve independent representation to ensure that their interests remain front and center.

The national law determines whether a person is a minor and whether a married woman can contract without authorization from her husband. It determines also the method, if any, by which the capacity of a person under disability can be supplemented, as, for example, by authorization from his legal representative or a court of guardianship.
