40|$|Future {{commercial}} space {{systems may}} include geosynchronous-orbit communication satellites; Earth-observing satellites in polar, sun-synchronous orbits; and tended low-earth-orbit platforms. All such space systems require onboard propulsion {{for a variety}} of functions, including stationkeeping and drag makeup, <b>apogee</b> <b>motors,</b> and delivery and return. In many cases, the onboard propulsion exerts a major influence on the overall mission performance, lifetime, and integration. NASA has established a Low Thrust Propulsion Program, which is developing chemical and electric propulsion concepts that offer potential for significant benefits for onboard propulsion for the various classes of commercial spacecraft. The onboard propulsion requirements of future commercial space systems are briefly discussed, followed by a summary of the characteristics and status of relevant elements of the NASA Low Thrust program...|$|R

50|$|Unlike earlier GPS satellites, {{which were}} {{launched}} on Atlas E/F and Delta II rockets, GPS IIF SV-1 was placed directly into its operational orbit, {{eliminating the need}} for an <b>apogee</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is a {{satellite}} platform manufactured by Orbital Sciences Corporation with an <b>apogee</b> kick <b>motor</b> {{to place a}} communications satellite into geostationary orbit, a thruster to provide the satellite with orbital station-keeping for a 15-year mission, and solar arrays to provide the satellite payload with 5 kW of electrical power.|$|R
50|$|The launch {{successfully}} placed GOES-C into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, {{from which}} it raised itself to geostationary orbit using an onboard SVM-5 <b>apogee</b> <b>motor.</b> Its insertion into geosynchronous orbit occurred at 03:22 on 17 June.|$|E
50|$|Following launch, the {{satellite}} raised its own orbit {{by means of}} an onboard <b>apogee</b> <b>motor.</b> At 18:33 GMT on 31 May, it was injected into geostationary orbit. It was subsequently tested, and positioned at a longitude of 113° West for operational service.|$|E
50|$|Optus D3 {{separated}} from its carrier rocket into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, {{from which it}} raised itself to geostationary orbit using an IHI -500-N <b>apogee</b> <b>motor.</b> It has a design life of fifteen years, and carries thirty two J band transponders (US IEEE Ku band).|$|E
50|$|After its {{launch into}} Geo-synchronous {{transfer}} orbit by Soyuz, AMOS-2 {{was taken to}} its final geo-stationary orbit by firing the <b>apogee</b> boost <b>motor</b> in phases.

5000|$|Initial {{versions}} of the Blok DM-03 are powered by a single RD-58M engine, fueled by RG-1 and oxidised by liquid oxygen. The last evolution is powered by the improved RD-58MF a less powerful but more efficient evolution of the venerable engine. It can carry 25% more propellant than the Blok DM-2, which it replaced as a Proton upper stage for some government launches. However most government launches and all commercial missions use the Briz-M instead. The payloads {{for the first two}} Blok DM-03 launches were groups of three Uragan-M satellites for the GLONASS programme, with further missions slated to carry three more Uragan-M satellites, and two Ekspress satellites on separate launches. The Blok DM can inject payloads into orbit more accurately than the Briz-M, [...] making it better suited for launching satellites such as the Uragan-M which lack <b>apogee</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|STAR-1 (originally STARBus): small {{commercial}} satellite platform. Originally {{developed by}} CTA, bought by Orbital Sciences Corporation. Could handle payloads {{with a mass}} of up to 200 kg and requiring up to 555 W of power.

50|$|GOES-I was {{launched}} aboard a Martin Marietta Atlas I rocket, flying from Launch Complex 36B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 06:04 GMT on 13 April 1994, {{and placed the}} satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. It was then raised into geostationary orbit {{by means of an}} R-4D-11 <b>apogee</b> <b>motor.</b> During the first burn of the <b>apogee</b> <b>motor,</b> an unusually high temperature was detected in one of the flanges upon which a thruster was mounted, however later analysis, based on satellites using similar thruster systems, demonstrated that it was still acceptable. During the third burn, a malfunction of the computer controlling the attitude control system caused several manoeuvring thrusters to fire. This resulted in the burn being aborted.|$|E

The 440-newton liquid <b>apogee</b> <b>motor</b> was successfully test fired on 22 September at 09:00 UTC for 3.968 seconds, about 41 hours before actual orbit insertion.|$|E
50|$|The {{launch of}} Intelsat 804 {{made use of}} a Ariane 4 rocket flying from Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guiana. The launch took place at 00:116 UTC on December22, 1997, with the {{spacecraft}} entering a geosynchronous transfer orbit. The satellite subsequently fired its <b>apogee</b> <b>motor</b> to achieve geostationary orbit.|$|E
50|$|With {{a mass of}} 1370 kg at launch, AMOS-2 {{incorporated}} a 400 newton Liquid <b>Apogee</b> Boost <b>Motor</b> (ABM) and fourteen 10 newton Reaction Control Thrusters for raising the satellite's orbit from Geostationary Transfer orbit to its final geostationary orbit {{as well as for}} its attitude control.

40|$|A {{review of}} typical {{surveillance}} and monitoring practices followed during the flight phases of representative solid-propellant upper stages and <b>apogee</b> <b>motors</b> {{was conducted to}} evaluate the need for improved flight diagnostic instrumentation on future spacecraft. The capabilities of the flight instrumentation package were limited to the detection {{of whether or not}} the solid motor was the cause of failure and to the identification of probable primary failure modes. Conceptual designs of self-contained flight instrumentation packages capable of meeting these reqirements were generated and their performance, typical cost, and unit characteristics determined. Comparisons of a continuous real time and a thresholded hybrid design were made on the basis of performance, mass, power, cost, and expected life. The results of this analysis substantiated the feasibility of a self-contained independent flight instrumentation module as well as the existence of performance margins by which to exploit growth option applications...|$|R
50|$|Even though Landsat 6 {{separated}} from the rocket {{at the appropriate time}} and place, the satellite failed to reach orbit. Since fuel could not reach the reaction engines, the satellite could not maintain attitude control during the <b>apogee</b> kick <b>motor</b> (AKM) burn. This caused the satellite to tumble during the burn, resulting in a failure to orbit due to the wasted energy.|$|R
