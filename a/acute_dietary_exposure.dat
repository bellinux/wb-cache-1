The hypothesis under test was that acute metal pre-exposure would affect the assimilation efficiency (AE) of that and other metals and their rate of uptake from solution. It was found that pre-exposure of the barnacles to atypically high dietary challenges of Cd and Ag did not cause changes in the rates of uptake of Cd, Ag or Zn from solution. Similarly, there was no clear consistent effect of dietary pre-exposure to Cd or Ag on the assimilation efficiency of Cd, Ag or Zn. The efflux rates of the metals were also comparable following the <b>acute</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure.</b> Subcellular fractionation data indicated {{that the majority of}} the three metals were partitioned in the insoluble fraction, with very little in the soluble fraction consisting of metal lothionein-like proteins and other (heat-sensitive) proteins. The lack of induction of increased Cd or Ag AE after pre-exposure in barnacles contrasts with results for mussels; this inconsistency is interpreted to result from differences in physiological accumulation patterns, the barnacles relying to an extreme extent on insoluble detoxification.

Changes in the human plasma and urinary metabolome associated with <b>acute</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> to sucrose and the identification of potential biomarkers of sucrose intake. Molecular Nutrition and Food Research, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. Scope The intake of sucrose is of public health concern but limited information is available on the metabolic effects of short-term exposure. Our aim was to use metabolomics to investigate the metabolic impact of acute sucrose exposure. Methods and results We performed a randomized, parallel, single-dose feeding study on healthy females (n = 90, aged 29. 9 ? 4. 7 years, BMI 23. 3 ? 2. 5 kg/m 2) consuming either 0, 50, or 100 g sucrose in 500 mL water. Blood and urine samples were taken before and 24 h post sucrose intake. Urine and plasma samples underwent detailed metabolite profiling analysis using established protocols. Flow-injection electrospray MS fingerprinting analysis showed that 3 h after intake was the most informative time point in urine and plasma and out of 120 explanatory signals, highlighted 16 major metabolite signals in urine and 25 metabolite signals in plasma that were discriminatory and correlated with sucrose intake over time. The main confirmed metabolites positively correlated with intake were sucrose, fructose, and erythronic acid, while those negatively correlating with intake included fatty acids and derivatives, acyl-carnitines, and ketone bodies. GC-TOF-MS profiling analysis confirmed the fingerprinting data. Conclusion Acute exposure to sucrose identified a number of metabolites correlated with sucrose intake and several compounds attributed to metabolic fasting. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

Although rainbow trout {Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestinal epithelial cells have been isolated in previous studies, a standard, reliable method for their isolation has not been identified. Nanoparticles are included in many conmionly used products throughout the commercial industry. Their use as environmental decontaminants means that {{they are likely to}} get into the food chain. Respiratory exposure has been studied but as far as could be identified, dietary exposure has not yet been studied. Fish are a major source of food for humans; the effect of dietary exposure to their health needs to be identified. This project approached two areas: firstiy the development of a reliable, reproducible method for the isolation of rainbow trout intestinal epithelial cells and secondly, in vitro exposure of the isolated cells to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nanoTiOi). A method involving intestinal aggravation whilst in an isolation solution was successfiiUy developed. Cells were exposed to nanoTi 02 at a range of concentrations for 90 minutes with samples being taken for analysis every 15 minutes. A trypan blue exclusion assay identified significant differences between the exposure viabilities and the control viability. Unexpectedly the viability was increased with the apparent removal of a stabilisation period that had been identified in the cell isolation development. None of the other data that was collected identified any patterns suggesting a toxic effect of nanoTiOa on the cells. It was concluded that i f rainbow trout experienced an <b>acute</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> to the nanoTi 02 they would survive. The effects of a chronic dietary exposure to the nanoTiOa do still need to be assessed though since suggestions of induced apoptosis did emerge from the data. To perform these in vitro, methods of either culturing the isolated cells or identifying a medium which allows them to survive for longer needs to be studied. Faculty of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Consumer risk {{assessment}} {{is a crucial}} step in the regulatory approval of pesticide use on food crops. Recently, an additional hurdle {{has been added to}} the formal consumer {{risk assessment}} process with the introduction of short-term intake or exposure assessment and a comparable short-term toxicity reference, the acute reference dose. Exposure to residues during one meal or over one day is important for short-term or acute intake. Exposure in the short term can be substantially higher than average because the consumption of a food on a single occasion can be very large compared with typical long-term or mean consumption and the food may have a much larger residue than average. Furthermore, the residue level in a single unit of a fruit or vegetable may be higher by a factor (defined as the variability factor, which we have shown to be typically × 3 for the 97. 5 th percentile unit) than the average residue in the lot. Available marketplace data and supervised residue trial data are examined in an investigation of the variability of residues in units of fruit and vegetables. A method is described for estimating the 97. 5 th percentile value from sets of unit residue data. Variability appears to be generally independent of the pesticide, the crop, crop unit size and the residue level. The deposition of pesticide on the individual unit during application is probably the most significant factor. The diets used in the calculations ideally come from individual and household surveys with enough consumers of each specific food to determine large portion sizes. The diets should distinguish the different forms of a food consumed, eg canned, frozen or fresh, because the residue levels associated with the different forms may be quite different. Dietary intakes may be calculated by a deterministic method or a probabilistic method. In the deterministic method the intake is estimated with the assumptions of large portion consumption of a ‘high residue’ food (high residue {{in the sense that the}} pesticide was used at the highest recommended label rate, the crop was harvested at the smallest interval after treatment and the residue in the edible portion was the highest found in any of the supervised trials in line with these use conditions). The deterministic calculation also includes a variability factor for those foods consumed as units (eg apples, carrots) to allow for the elevated residue in some single units which may not be seen in composited samples. In the probabilistic method the distribution of dietary consumption and the distribution of possible residues are combined in repeated probabilistic calculations to yield a distribution of possible residue intakes. Additional information such as percentage commodity treated and combination of residues from multiple commodities may be incorporated into probabilistic calculations.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of human illnesses associated with West Nile Virus (WNV) occurred in New York City in 1999. Since then, it has gradually spread westwards, reaching northern California {{for the first}} time in 2005. WNV is transmitted by several mosquito species and birds serve as the main reservoir. Several control measures have been used, targeting both the aquatic larvae and the adult mosquitoes. In the latter case, roosting birds in trees are sprayed with pyrethroid insecticides because these are highly toxic to mosquitoes, but have low avian toxicity. A request was made to use a resmethrin-containing insecticide during the month of October 2005 in California. Because resmethrin was not registered for use on growing crops, concerns were raised about potential crop contamination. Therefore, an expedited dietary risk assessment was conducted on resmethrin.

40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{are natural}} {{phenomena}} {{caused by the}} massive growth of phytoplankton that may contain highly toxic chemicals, the so-called marine biotoxins causing illness and even death to both aquatic organisms and humans. Their occurrence has been increased in frequency and severity, suggesting a worldwide public health risk. Marine biotoxins can accumulate in bivalve molluscs and regulatory limits have been set for some classes according to European Union legislation. These compounds can be distinguished in water- and fat-soluble molecules. The first group involves those of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, whereas the toxins soluble in fat can cause Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning and Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning. Due {{to the lack of}} long-term toxicity studies, establishing tolerable daily intakes for any of these marine biotoxins was not possible, but an acute reference dose can be considered more appropriate, because these molecules show an <b>acute</b> toxicity. <b>Dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> assessment is linked both to the levels of marine biotoxins present in bivalve molluscs and the portion that could be eaten by consumers. Symptoms may vary from a severe gastrointestinal intoxication with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps to neurological disorders such as ataxia, dizziness, partial paralysis, and respiratory distress. The official method for the detection of marine biotoxins is the mouse bioassay (MBA) showing some limits due to ethical restrictions and insufficient specificity. For this reason, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has replaced MBA as the reference technique. However, the monitoring of algal blooms producing marine biotoxins should be regularly assessed in order to obtain more reliable, accurate estimates of bloom toxicity and their potential impacts...|$|R

JECFA, thus, comprehensively addresses acute and chronic risks by using corresponding estimates for acute and chronic exposure and suitable correction for the limited bioavailability of bound residues by the Gallo-Torres model. On a case-by-case basis, JECFA also considers degradation products that occur from normal food processing of food containing veterinary drug residues.
