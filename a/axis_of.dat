Basic parameters <b>of</b> <b>axis</b> X portal milling machines, options of measuring, guiding <b>of</b> <b>axis</b> and electric motors. Then the limit suitability of using pinion and gear rack is determined. In next chapters is designed few variations of arrangements of drives and selected the best one.

5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis {{is defined as the}} line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the planet Mercury is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally {{no more than a few}} degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E

5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments.

Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E

5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune.

5|$|Although {{both sides}} claimed victory, neither {{achieved}} all their objectives; the JNA garrison evacuated the Logorište barracks, but Croatian defences elsewhere held.

While the JNA removed some weapons and equipment stored in the Logorište barracks, the remaining supplies were removed by the ZNG over a one-week period after the battle.|$|E
5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams.

Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E

5|$|By September 1993, CANBAT 1 was {{relocated}} from Sector West to Sector South (northern Dalmatia and Lika). The UNPFROFOR mandate in Croatia expired on 31 March 1995, and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 981 {{establishing the}} United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) instead. Sector West {{was captured by}} the HV in Operation Flash in early May 1995, with no resistance from UN peacekeepers.

At the same time, the 10th Brigade commanding officer was relieved of duty for failure to advance. Regardless, the unit remained inactive. The HV units that managed to cross the river on 12 December surprised the JNA and reported inflicting considerable casualties.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
