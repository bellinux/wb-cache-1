50|$|The {{role of the}} Mannheim school's composers in the {{evolution}} of the classical symphony is thus significant, although most scholars now agree that these changes occurred nearly simultaneously at various other centers, e.g. in Berlin <b>and</b> <b>Vienna.</b> <b>Their</b> influence on {{the evolution}} of the classical music period is due to the reputation of the ensemble at one hand, and on the other hand to the fact, that the compositions of the Mannheim school's composers were published in Paris and London as well, some of their works even multiple times of different publishers.|$|R

A close collaboration between Leeder and Jooss followed, lasting twenty-three years. In 1926 he was given a teaching and leadership commission at the Westfälische Akademie für Bewegung, Sprache und Musik in Münster. The following year, with Kurt Jooss, he founded the Neue Tanzbühne at the Münster Theater, which employed Fritz A. Cohen as a pianist, Aino Siimola - future wife of Jooss - as a dancer, and Hein Heckroth as stage and costume designer. He also became a professor at the newly established Folkwangschule in Essen.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Vienna {{classification}} of Crohn's disease (CD) subdivides patients {{according to their}} age at diagnosis (A), disease location (L), and disease behavior (B). AIM The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCAs) or anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs) correlate to subtypes of CD according to this classification. METHODS: pANCA, ASCA-immunoglobulin (Ig) A, and ASCA-IgG were detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 120 sera of patients with CD <b>and</b> compared with <b>their</b> <b>Vienna</b> classification. RESULTS: Patients with diagnosis of CD at an age of 40 years or older (A 2) were more frequently pANCA-positive than those whose disease started at a younger age (A 1) (19 % vs. 5 %, p < 0. 05). pANCA-positive patients almost exclusively belonged to the nonpenetrating disease groups (B 1 and B 2); only one patient had penetrating disease (B 3) (B 3 vs. non-B 3 : p = 0. 02). There was a cluster of pANCA-positive patients within the A 1 B 2 L 3 subgroup (B 2 : stricturing disease; L 3 : ileocolonic involvement). Only 7. 5 % of ASCA-IgA-positive patients presented with CD that was limited to the colon (L 2). ASCA-IgA and ASCA-IgG were more frequently found in patients with upper gastrointestinal disease (L 4) (ASCA-IgA: 66. 7 % vs. 31. 5 % in non-L 4, p < 0. 05; ASCA-IgG: 44. 4 % vs. 27. 9 %, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: pANCA and ASCA may be useful in predicting subtypes of CD. They therefore may be helpful in developing subtype-specific disease management strategies...|$|R

5000|$|At {{this time}} operatic style was {{undergoing}} significant change, {{and the model}} of opera seria that Hasse and Metastasio had settled found itself assailed {{by the threat of}} the reforms of Christoph Willibald Gluck and Ranieri de' Calzabigi, as laid down in the music and libretto for Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. Charles Burney, visiting Vienna in 1773, reported on the debate. Party runs as high among poets, musicians <b>and</b> <b>their</b> adherents, at <b>Vienna</b> as elsewhere. Metastasio and Hasse, may be said, to be at the head of one of the principal sects; and Calsabigi and Gluck of another. The first, regarding all innovations as quackery, adhere to the ancient form of the musical drama, in which the poet and musician claim equal attention from an audience; the bard in the recitatives and narrative parts; and the composer in the airs, duos and choruses. The second party depend more on theatrical effects, propriety of character, simplicity of diction, and of musical execution, than on, what they style flowery description, superfluous similes, sententious and cold morality, on one side, with tiresome symphonies, and long divisions, on the other.|$|R
