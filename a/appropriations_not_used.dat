In 1879, the legislature authorized such a facility, but the <b>appropriation</b> was <b>not</b> <b>used</b> for this. In 1883, the governor again tried to fund a new institution, but there was disagreement over the site with both Springfield and Joliet as possibilities. In 1889, the legislature established the Asylum for Insane Criminals, and it received its first patients on November 2, 1891. W.T. Patterson transferred from the staff of Elgin State Hospital to become its first Superintendent. Control of the institution was placed with the Commissioners of the Southern Penitentiary at Menard. The original building on the penitentiary grounds was poorly constructed and was eventually torn down. A replacement was built on a separate campus near Chester, Illinois. When the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities was abolished in 1909, the institute was reorganized and renamed Chester State Hospital effective January 1, 1910. In 1917, the Department of Public Welfare assumed responsibility for Chester State Hospital and retained control until {{the creation of the}} Department of Mental Health in 1961 (L. 1961, p. 2666). In 1975, the hospital changed its name to the Chester Mental Health Center.|$|R

40|$|This article {{suggests}} {{an approach to}} representation simultaneously constructivist, sociocultural, and interpretive that can address the complementary roles of culture and individual agency in development. The necessary starting point is to recognize, following Durkheim, that collective representations are an irreducible reality sui generis and play a constitutive role in the formation and structuring of individual representa-tions. Development must {{be understood as a}} genuinely dialectical process that includes the active <b>appropriation</b> (<b>not</b> just passive absorption) of collective representations through various modes of socially structured symbolic action. This requires both distin-guishing and grasping the interplay of three analytical levels: individual, relational or interactional, and collective. Piaget's work is shown to offer an instructive case of how promising tendencies in this direction have become derailed. The authors also offer a concrete illustration of one line of research informed by the kind of theoretical approac...|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the costs}} for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been funded through regular {{appropriations}} bills, but through emergency supplemental appropriations bills. As such, most of these expenses {{were not included in}} the budget deficit calculation prior to FY2010. Some budget experts argue that emergency supplemental <b>appropriations</b> bills do <b>not</b> receive the same level of legislative care as regular appropriations bills. In addition, emergency supplemental <b>appropriations</b> are <b>not</b> subject to the same budget enforcement mechanisms imposed on regular appropriations. Funding for the first stages of the Vietnam War was provided by supplemental appropriations, although President Johnson eventually acceded to Congressional demands to fund that war through the regular appropriations process.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{a growing number of}} {{publications}} propounding the utility for settler-Australians (and others) of Aboriginal spirituality, other cultural property and identity have emerged.

Nor have the various critiques of academics, literary critics, artists, journalists and a range of other concerned individuals. A reason for their concern is that much of the work advocating the usefulness to settler-Australians and others of Aboriginal non-material cultural property is engaged in the practice of exploitative <b>appropriation,</b> <b>not</b> mutually enriching cultural exchange. Various qualities are assigned to Aborigines according to whatever needs they are being asked to address.

40|$|Cultural {{appropriation}} {{is often}} mentioned but undertheorized in critical rhetorical and media studies. Defined {{as the use}} of a culture’s symbols, artifacts, genres, rituals, or technologies by members of another culture, cultural appropriation can be placed into 4 categories: exchange, dominance, exploitation, and transculturation. Although each of these types can be understood as relevant to particular contexts or eras, transculturation questions the bounded and proprietary view of culture embedded in other types of appropriation. Transculturation posits culture as a relational phenomenon constituted by acts of <b>appropriation,</b> <b>not</b> an entity that merely participates in appropriation. Ten-sions exist between the need to challenge essentialism and the use of essentialist notions such as ownership and degradation to criticize the exploitation of colonized cultures. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1468 - 2885. 2006. 00277. x Cultural appropriation, defined broadly {{as the use of}} a culture’s symbols, artifacts, genres, rituals, or technologies by members of another culture, is inescapable when cultures come into contact, including virtual or representational contact.
