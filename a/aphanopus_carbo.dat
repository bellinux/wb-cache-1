5|$|Given {{the depths}} {{at which it}} lives, the goblin shark poses no danger to humans. A few {{specimens}} have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums, though they only survived a short time. One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer. This shark is not targeted by any fisheries, but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls, hooked on longlines, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; {{one of the few}} areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A black scabbardfish (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo)</b> fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the goblin shark under Least Concern. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.|$|E
500|$|The {{first known}} {{bigeye sand tiger}} was a female [...] long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a {{longline}} set for black scabbardfish (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo).</b> The specimen was mounted and later {{formed the basis for}} a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae. He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo César de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox). Until more specimens were examined in the 1980s, some authors speculated that this species represented an extreme variant of the smalltooth sand tiger.

40|$|The {{sagittal}} otolith and eye {{diameter of}} two sympatric {{species of the}} genus <b>Aphanopus,</b> A. <b>carbo</b> and A. intermedius, from North Atlantic waters were investigated. The study objectives were to find morphometric variables of otoliths to identify the two species and relate ecomorphological characters of otolith and eye diameter to the depth distribution of each species. The otoliths of the two species are very similar, although significant differences in shape, otolith height and weight and the sulcus acusticus area were detected. The ratio between eye diameter and cephalic length (ED:CL ratio) was also significantly different. In both analyses A. carbo obtained higher values, which suggests that A. carbo and A. intermedius live in different spatial niches, and that A. carbo inhabits deeper waters. The ratio between the sulcus and otolith areas (S:O) was low compared to other fish species, {{which suggests that the}} hearing capacity of Aphanopus spp. is adapted to low frequency sound. This adaptation {{may be related to the}} oceanographic conditions in which these species live, and in particular to the characteristics of sound transmission in the “SOFAR channel”...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} use of parasites as {{biological}} tags for discriminating fish stocks of <b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo</b> (Osteichthyes: Trichiuridae) from Portugal (Sesimbra on the mainland, Madeira and the Azores). Sixteen different metazoan parasites were found (14 from Madeira, 9 from Sesimbra and 7 from the Azores). Some parasites occurred only in fish from Madeira. The prevalence and mean intensity of the infection was recorded for each parasite and locality, and their values were statistically compared between the three sampling localities and related to host length classes. The differences between some of these parameters were statistically significant among the three localities or between two of them. It is suggested that 6 parasites (Tentacularia coryphaenae, Sphyriocephalus tergestinus, Campbelliella heteropoeciloacantha, Anisakis spp., Bolbosoma vasculosum and unidentified Acanthocephala larvae) {{can be used as}} biological tags to discriminate Portuguese stocks of <b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo...</b>|$|E

The present work describes the main characteristics of the fisheries for the three species mentioned above that take place mainly from Sesimbra and Peniche. Sesimbra accounts for nearly 50 % of the deep-water sharks landings in mainland Portugal and deep-water sharks constitute a by-catch of the black scabbardfish (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo)</b> fishery and in Peniche, a by-catch of multispecies artisanal fisheries.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mercury is a {{well-known}} toxic element present in seafood. Nevertheless some antioxidants, like selenium, as an integral component of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and alpha-tocopherol having a protective role against it, are present as well. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the levels of total mercury (Hg-T), organic mercury (Hg-Org), Se and alpha-tocopherol in some adult deep-water fish species caught off Portuguese waters. RESULTS: Levels of Hg-T were above EU limits in 6 % of Lophius spp. and <b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo,</b> 2 % ofLepidorhombus spp. and 70 % of Helicolenus dactylopterus. Hg-Org represented the major fraction (more than 84 %) of Hg-T in all studied muscles. The selenium concentration in muscle was similar in all species (about 0. 4 mg kg(- 1) wet weight) and the highest level of alpha-tocopherol (70 mg kg(- 1) wet weight) was found in <b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo.</b> CONCLUSION: The muscle of all species studied is a good source of selenium, but only can give a small contribution of alpha-tocopherol. Attending to the provisional tolerable weekly intake established by the WHO/FAO for methylmercury, it appears that the species studied should be consumed sparingly.

Significant geographical differences in intensity were found: the Azores showed the lowest mean intensity value (53. 7) and Madeira the highest one (253. 9). The intensity of infection was positively correlated with the host length in specimens of Sesimbra and Madeira. Significant seasonal differences in intensity were found in the studied regions.

40|$|As human {{exploration}} and harvesting {{moves to the}} high seas, ecological understanding of the deep sea has become a priority, especially in those commercially exploited species whose life cycle, habitat use, and demographic structure remain poorly understood. Here we combine otolith trace element and stable isotope analyses with microsatellite data to investigate population structure and connectivity in the migratory deep-sea black scabbardfish (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo),</b> sampled along a latitudinal gradient spanning much of the known species range in the Northeast Atlantic. In each sampled life stage, otolith trace element and oxygen isotope compositions are similar among fish from different capture locations, but otolith compositions vary greatly between life stages. Oxygen isotope compositions indicate ontogenetic migrations from relatively warm water conditions during larval growth to cooler waters with increasing age. Analysis of microsatellite DNA also suggests lack of genetic structure among the areas sampled. The multidisciplinary approach employed collectively suggests that A. carbo individuals undergo an ocean-scale ontogenetic migration, beginning with spawning in southern, warm-water Macaronesian areas (potentially dominated by Madeira), followed by {{a large proportion of}} immature fish moving to and feeding on the continental slope in northern areas.

40|$|For several decades, {{the black}} {{scabbardfish}} (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo,</b> Lowe 1839) {{has been a}} valuable resource for fishing communities in Madeira and more recently for those in mainland Portugal. The evaluation of the species’ exploitation status was conducted only in the late 20 th century and separated for the two areas of the Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

This paper presents the first attempt to combine the information available from the two longline fisheries targeting black scabbardfish in Portuguese waters in one single analysis. A description of the two fleets’ technical characteristics was conducted and a unique model was developed for the standardization of the fishing effort aimed at the species in the Portuguese EEZ. From this model, weekly landings-per-unit-effort time series were estimated by region for the period 2005 - 2007 and compared using a non-parametric statistical test.

More specifically, models allows us to: (1) describe the differences between how the lower jaw lever system works during mouth closure and during generating static bite force; (2) evaluate the effects of morphological change on the performance of both functions; (3) determine whether the configuration of each component of the lower jaw lever system is a compromise between both functions, or whether there is a partition of function (optimization for either hard biting or fast jaw closing) between the different parts of the jaw closing musculature; and (4) discuss the dynamical implications of having elongate jaws for capturing prey. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 152, 717 – 736.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to follow the seasonal chemical changes and to study the effect of culinary treatments on the nutritional value of black scabbardfish (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo).</b> The proximate chemical composition of black scabbardfish (BSF) landed in Sesimbra (Portugal) was followed for one year. The nutritional quality (proximate chemical composition, amino acid and fatty acid profiles, cholesterol and minerals) of raw, fried and grilled BSF was evaluated in one period of the year. BSF is a semi-fatty species, the protein content was 15 - 17. 5 % and the most abundant amino acids were glutamic acid, aspartic acid and lysine. The dominant fatty acids were monounsaturated (66 %), followed by saturated (19 %) and polyunsaturated (10 %) ones. Potassium, phosphorus and sodium were the most abundant minerals. Some dehydration occurred in cooked BSF but fat content was the most affected nutrient, particularly in fried fish. These results may suggest that the absorption of frying oil led to important changes in the fatty acid profile, and particularly in the linoleic acid level. The highest protein losses were recorded in fried BSF. In general, the nutritional quality of grilled fish seemed to be more balanced than that of fried fish...|$|E

Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the comparison of metal levels between geographic locations. Other factors such as size, sex and sexual maturity were also investigated. The median concentrations (mg/kg ww) of THg showed a decreasing trend in the order liver>muscle>gonad. Cadmium levels decreased in the order liver>gonad>muscle and Pb levels decreased in the order gonad>liver>muscle. According to the EU limits, the concentration observed in some specimens, particularly those of THg, raises some food safety concerns. In all the tissues the concentrations of each toxic metal differed between locations. In particular: i) THg concentrations in specimens from Madeira were significantly higher than those from the Azores and the mainland; ii) Cd levels in specimens from the mainland were significantly higher than those from Madeira and the Azores; and iii) for all analysed tissues Pb levels were significantly higher in specimens from the Azores than in those from the mainland.

40|$|We review {{information}} from scientific trawl surveys carried out between 1977 and 2002 in the Porcupine Seabight and Abyssal Plain {{area of the}} Northeast Atlantic (240 - 4865 m water depth). Since the late 1980 s, commercial bottom-trawl fisheries targeting mainly roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black scabbardfish (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo),</b> and orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) have been operating at depths of 500 - 1500 m, intersecting the depth ranges of 77 demersal fish species that would therefore be vulnerable to fishery effects. Comparisons of trawls pre- 1989 and post- 1997 indicate {{a significant decrease in}} total abundance of demersal fish down to 2500 m. Detailed analyses of the 15 most-abundant species showed that nine species with depth ranges within the commercial fishing depth have decreased in abundance. Other species were either not affected (Bathypterois dubius) or only affected at the shallow end of their range (Coryphaenoides guentheri). Species with a minimum depth of occurrence > 1500 m (Coryphaenoides armatus and Coryphaenoides leptolepis) increased in abundance over part of their depth range. Decreases in abundance are probably caused by commercial fishing activities, an effect that is transmitted downslope by removal of fish at the shallow end of their depth range, resulting in declines at the deeper end of the depth range. The estimated fishery area is ca. 52 000 km(2), but the potential impact probably extends to ca. 142 000 km(2) and to many non-target species...|$|E

Prevalence [mean intensity (range) ] of T. coryphaenae, S. tergestinus and Nybetinia spp. in A. carbo (n = 135) was 12. 6 % [1. 65 ± 1. 27 (1 - 6) ], 5. 9 % [1. 57 ± 0. 79 (1 - 3) ] and 2. 2 % [1. 33 ± 0. 58 (1 - 2) ] respectively. The prevalence of T. coryphaenae and S. tergestinus showed some seasonality, with a rise in prevalence of T. coryphaenae corresponding to a decrease in prevalence of S. tergestinus. However these differences were not significant. In T. picturatus (n = 304) only N. lingualis was found at a prevalence of 9. 6 %. Both S. tergestinus and N. lingualis were recovered only from the stomach mucosa or external stomach wall, while T. coryphaenae was observed either attached to the stomach mucosa or free in the visceral cavity of the fish. The paper presents the first scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of Sphyriocephalus tergestinus and a new geographical record of N. lingualis in T. picturatu...|$|E

40|$|Potential for new {{developments}} in deep water fishing have been identified by two sampling surveys carried out in April and September 1993, in the deep waters off {{the west coast of}} Ireland and Scotland. The primary objective of the two surveys was to secure samples of a variety of potentially commercial deep water fish species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. These data will be essential in formulating management plans for the expanding deep water fisheries in the area. The surveys were conducted on a chartered fishing vessel using a commercial otter trawl, fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. Fishing activity concentrated on the depth range 400 m- 1200 m and a total of 81 trawling operations were carried out, of which 75 produced fish catches with limited gear damage. Fifteen species of cartilaginous and 50 species of teleost fish were recorded from the catches. These include the roundnose grenadier Coryphaenoides rupestris, black scabbard <b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo,</b> greater forkbeard Phycis blennoides, blue-mouth rockfish Helicolenus dactylopterus and Baird's smooth-head Alepocephalus bairdii. Length, weight, sex, maturity and catch data together with samples of otoliths, gonads and stomachs were secured. In general terms, the fishing ground off the north west of Ireland and west of Scotland caused little problems with gear damage and yielded good catches of deep water species. The two surveys have shown the areas have potential for commercial deep water fishing but the development of this fishery in the area will be contingent on the establishment of suitable markets. This initial report documents the surveys and presents some preliminary results. The data gathered from these surveys are currently under analysis at the FRC and the results will be published in the scientific literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of fish stocks exploitation {{is a complex}} task that comprehends the analysis of several types of data including information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of commercial fishing fleets. Satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) {{is one of the}} best independent data sources available that can provide information on fishing fleet operations. This type of system allows the transmission of data from a satellite-tracking device installed on board to a land-based Fisheries Monitoring Centre. The data transmitted typically contains information on date/time, longitude and latitude coordinates and vessel’s speed and course. Aiming to characterize the fishing operations of the Portuguese deep-water longline fleet targeting black scabbardfish (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo</b> Lowe, 1839), to identify its main fishing areas and also to calculate fishing trip durations, IPIMAR has been analysing VMS data provided by the Portuguese General Fisheries Inspections Service (IGP). In general, data points from the Portuguese VMS are recorded in a constant time lag of 10 min. However, owing to several technical and non-technical problems related with the transmission device installed on board, vessel’s datasets can exhibit large time differences (> 4 hours) between consecutive data points. These temporal discontinuities pose serious difficulties to the analyst when trying to track down vessel’s operations at sea. The present paper presents a software toolkit composed by a set of procedures developed using Oracle PL/SQL and Oracle SPATIAL tools to extract and classify fishing trips held by the longline vessels from VMS discontinued data. The set of procedures was implemented taking into account ancillary information about the fishing operations characteristics and the number of fishing hauls held by fishing trip. The toolkit enabled to identify fishing operations held at sea by fishing trip, namely setting and hauling o...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado, Biologia Marinha, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2016 The black {{scabbardfish}} (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo</b> Lowe, 1839) is a benthopelagic species, {{member of the}} Trichiuridae family with great commercial and scientific importance in Madeira Archipelago and in the entire NE Atlantic. This work, {{as part of a}} bicephalous approach, had two main objectives: perform a biological analysis of A. carbo, and to standardize commercial LPUE data of Aphanopus spp. landed in Madeira Archipelago (A. carbo is not separated from the sympatric species A. intermedius for commercial purposes). In terms of A. carbo biology, individuals were collected in Funchal harbour between 2010 and 2015. In this part of the study, the population structure of A. carbo was analysed through individual length, weight and sex. The reproductive cycle was inferred through the analysis of GSI, HSI and Krel monthly trends. L 50 s were estimated by fitting maturity ogives and WLRs and LLRs were calculated through regressions. Regarding the LPUE standardization, fishery-dependent data was analysed from 2008 to 2015. This part focused on fleet characteristics, the performance of landing trends and effort units. Nominal LPUE was standardized through linear model. The factors affecting the variability of LPUE were obtained and analysis of the overall state of the fishery was made. In general, A. carbo females attain the largest length and weight, the overall sex-ratio differed from 1 : 1 ratio, with females outnumbering males, spawning is performed {{in the last quarter of}} the year, L 50 s were higher in females than in males, and it exhibits isometric growth in terms of WLRs (except for males) and allometric growth in LLRs. The standardization of commercial LPUE data revealed an hyperstability state in Aphanopus spp. fishery in Madeira EEZ. To compensate lower catches in traditional fishing grounds, fishermen exploit new areas, resulting in stable landing performances. Thus, precautionary management policies are required to sustainably exploit this resource...|$|E
40|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtle}} juveniles (Caretta caretta), pelagic stage, {{are found in}} waters of Madeira archipelago. Pelagic turtles are in the main growth phase of their life cycle and {{consequently}} higher energy needs. However, knowledge about the ecology of pelagic loggerhead sea turtles is still quite rudimentary, mainly about the mechanisms that lead them to find food in the vast ocean. Studies with other pelagic species, such as procellariiform birds, revealed that the olfactory system {{play an important role}} for the detection of feeding areas, through the detection of concentration peaks of DMS (dimethylsulfide), a scent compound that naturally exists in the marine environment and it is related to areas of high productivity. Based on the assumption that loggerhead sea turtles use a similar mechanism, behavioural experiments were conducted in order to analyze the chemoreception capacity to DMS (airborne chemoreception - theoretically responsible for the long distance detection of areas with food patches; and aquatic chemoreception - theoretically responsible for the short distance detection of preys). The first step was to observe if pelagic loggerheads demonstrate sensitivity to DMS and the second was to verify if they really use the DMS, in natural conditions, as an airborne cue to find areas where food patches might be available. Four juveniles of loggerhead sea turtles were tested in captivity and three wild turtles in the open ocean. The results of airborne chemoreception experiments in captivity revealed that one turtle clearly demonstrated sensitivity to DMS and the sea experiments confirmed this result. However, the experiments were not conclusive on the question whether the pelagic turtles actually use the DMS as an airborne cue to detect long distance food patches. In aquatic chemoreception experiments was not observed sensitivity to DMS by the three sea turtles tested. In the classical conditioning experiment, where DMS and food were given nearly at the same time revealed that after a certain period of time, the sea turtle tested did not associated the DMS stimulus with a possible food reward. The main cause of mortality of loggerhead sea turtles in Madeira waters is due to the accidental capture (bycatch) by deep pelagic longlines fishery which the target species is the black-scabbard (<b>Aphanopus</b> <b>carbo)</b> fish. Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) is one of the baits used in this fishery. Aquatic chemoreception experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the attractiveness of the chub mackerel for sea turtles. For the three sea turtles tested, the results showed that in 90 % of the cases the sea turtles were extremely attracted by the underwater smell of this fish.
