I will look in your eyes <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I'm not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb or moronic enough not to see that I would have stolen a melody. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only {{similarities}} are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry." ...|$|E

[...] Hirsh said: [...] "The biggest thing I {{got out of it}} was the confidence ...

2500|$|Brahms's {{personal}} life was also troubled. In 1859 he became engaged to Agathe von Siebold. The engagement was soon broken off, {{but even after}} this Brahms wrote to her: [...] "I love you! I must see you again, but I am incapable of bearing fetters. Please write me ... whether ... I may come again to clasp you in my arms, to kiss you, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I love you." [...] They never saw one another again, and Brahms later confirmed to a friend that Agathe was his [...] "last love".|$|E

They {{may also be}} {{in the form of}} a warning, such as stories of escaped convicts et cetera which urge the reader to pass the message on.

2500|$|That same day, Wurzelbacher also {{appeared}} on Good Morning America. Diane Sawyer {{asked him if}} he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said with a laugh [...] "No, not even close." [...] Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, [...] "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{you were going to be}} a major part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" [...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Runner {{up of the}} {{eleventh}} series, Vana Koutsomitis criticized the living conditions that candidates live in; granted they are accommodated in a lavish house, Vana claimed that the bosses impose living conditions similar to Big Brother - with strict rules and zero contact with outsiders. She said [...] "They just throw you into a house <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you have no phone, no internet and you’ll have no {{contact with the outside}} world, You can only talk to your family once a week for 10 minutes and that’s monitored. And we weren’t allowed to go to Boots to grab something. We had to be monitored and guided there." [...] She continued; [...] "I think that element of cabin fever and psychological torture is not necessary for a business competition. I don’t believe that you need to isolate people. I think you can gauge people’s business skills without putting them in that environment.|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, {{show it to you}} <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E

Cole said that he [...] "needed {{a little more time}} than that to get things done." [...] In promotion of Born Sinner, Cole released an EP titled Truly Yours on February 12, 2013, the project consisted of five tracks Cole knew would not appear on Born Sinner. On February 14, 2013, he released the artwork for the first single via Instagram.

Following the originally planned release date of January 28, 2013, Cole had announced a set release date of June 25, 2013 for Born Sinner. However, when it was announced that Kanye West's Yeezus would be released just one week earlier on June 18, Cole moved the release date of Born Sinner up a week in order to compete with West. He later commented, [...] "This is art, and I can't compete against the Kanye West celebrity and the status that he's earned just from being a genius... But I can put my name in the hat <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I think my album is great and you be the judge and you decide." [...] Cole released the second installment in the Truly Yours series on April 30, 2013, the EP featured guest appearances from Bas, Young Jeezy and 2 Chainz. Born Sinner sold 297,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, finishing approximately 30,000 copies short of Kanye West's Yeezus. He released three more singles in support of the album, [...] "Crooked Smile" [...] featuring TLC, [...] "Forbidden Fruit" [...] featuring Kendrick Lamar, and [...] "She Knows". As of December 2016, the album had sold 796,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
