40|$|Despite {{the urgent}} {{response}} {{that climate change}} demands, debate over climate change policy goes round and round without showing signs that it can rest long enough for action to be taken. Meanwhile, the situation with the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>commons</b> continues to deteriorate. In {{a desperate attempt to}} constructively contribute to the climate change debate and break through the morass, this paper engages with Act or Network Theory which affords practitioners the freedom to dialogue with the non-human. The result is a transcription of an interview with The Carbon Cycle. Using the concept of the technopolitical regime, The Carbon Cycle identifies two broadly defined philosophies that humans use to frame climate change policy. The two technopolitical regimes, what The Carbon Cycle calls the Interventionists and the Egalitarians, are informed by conflicting values. According to The Carbon Cycle, humans will need to face the difficult challenge of negotiating a policy response to climate change that lies somewhere between the interventionist and the egalitarian strategies.

40|$|Many {{have argued}} {{that there is no}} silver bullet capable of solving the complex and interdependent {{problems}} of climate change, sustainability, and economic development. A consensus is emerging, however, that a major culprit at the intersection of these problems is what the Stern Review (1) called the “greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen ”- the failure of the market to send proper signals about the real costs of greenhouse gas emissions. This is one of a long list of market failures surrounding open-access resources (2 - 6). The fact that the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>commons</b> is available as a repository for the wastes of greenhouse gas emitters free of charge, while the damages to society and human welfare are major and growing, is a serious problem that must be addressed {{to solve the problem of}} climate change.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} is an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>commons</b> problem where the basic actors are the states. In {{democratic}} nations national policy initiatives depend on {{the opinion of the}} electorate. Unless there is a proper popular perception of climate change, {{it will be difficult to}} undertake appropriate and timely measures. Previous experimental studies of people’s understanding of climate change and of other renewable resource problems have revealed that people misperceive the basic dynamics and that they favour decisions that are systematically biased in the direction of over-utilisation. In the present laboratory experiment, with 251 students, the focus is on understanding why people misperceive and how misperceptions could be avoided. Using a simulator, the subjects are asked to control total global emissions of CO 2 to reach a given target for the atmospheric CO 2 -concentration. Compared to a previous study we find that full information about a simplified system leads to improved performance, particularly among students with a background in mathematics. Subjects perform better in an analogous, however more easily visualisable system, indicating that they have difficulties forming appropriate mental models of the more abstract atmospheric problem. Two information treatments, thought to improve mental models, turn out to have insignificant effects. Finally, information feedback about the development of the CO 2 -concentration helps. According to our findings, current information from the IPCC and the standard media coverage is not effective in helping people to choose policies that are consistent with their own preferences...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{climate change}} as a problem of justice {{from the point of}} view of {{political}} philosophy, especially the distributive model of social justice. The main problem is to examine what justice in the context of climate change means and how it differs from and challenges the traditional ways of conceptualizing justice in terms of distribution. The main argument is that climate change is not simply a problem to be redressed by getting distributive aspects right, and in order to move on from remedial approaches towards preventing further damage it is necessary to discuss the issue in terms of refraining from harming. Climate change is understood in this thesis as fundamentally a question of justice. Justice in this context requires not only fairer allocation of shares of atmospheric capacity to absorb emissions and more generally of ecological space, but also shifting focus to the structures that maintain and reproduce the inequalities in access to environmental goods and distribution of burdens related to climate change. Also participation, which pertains to the domain of procedural justice, of the most vulnerable and powerless people and countries is a crucial aspect of climate justice. Climate change has catalyzed diverse claims and conceptualizations of justice, which reflects the condition of radical heterogenization of justice discourse. A climate treaty cannot address all these legitimate concerns, but this should not be confused with the idea that we should level down the claims of justice. While the idea of compensation of climate related damages is not entirely rejected, critical points about the possibility of compensating environmental goods such as <b>atmospheric</b> <b>commons</b> are raised. Compensatory justice has the same problem as distributive justice: it cannot create more of the depleted resource that is actually needed more than monetary compensation or substitute. In the discussion of the implications of scarcity on distribution and climate politics, the limitations of the ideas of distribution (as it is usually understood) and compensation become even more evident. This thesis examines climate {{change as a}} form of doing harm. This is a relatively novel approach to climate change and justice, because usually the debates revolve around the distributive aspects and not on normative analysis of the actions that contribute to climate change itself. The viewpoint of harm opens new possibilities to examine justice in climate change...|$|E

In the intervening period Lavoisier had {{ample time to}} repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave <b>common</b> <b>atmospheric</b> air. <b>Common</b> air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but [...] "nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air" [...] or the [...] "eminently respirable part of the air".

40|$|The Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) {{has been}} used in order to perform a {{high-resolution}} numerical simulation of two meteorological events related to the most <b>common</b> <b>atmospheric</b> environments during the summer over the Western Mediterranean coast: mesoscale circulations and western synoptic advections. In this regard, we take advantage of the operational RAMS configuration running within the real-time forecasting system environment already implemented over this Mediterranean area, precisely in the Valencia Region and nearby areas. The attention of this paper is especially focused on identifying the main features of both events and the ability of the model in resolving the associated characteristics as well as in performing a comprehensive evaluation of the model by means of diverse meteorological observations available within the selected periods over the area of study. Additionally, as this paper is centred in RAMS-based forecasts, two simulations are operated applying the most two recent versions of the RAMS model implemented in the above-mentioned system: RAMS 4. 4 and RAMS 6. 0. Therefore, a comparison among both versions of the model has been performed as well. Finally, it is our intention to contrast the RAMS forecasts for two completely different <b>atmospheric</b> conditions <b>common</b> with the area of study in the summer. A main difference between the simulation of both meteorological situations has been found in the humidity. In this sense, whilst the model underestimates this magnitude considering the mesoscale event, especially at night time, the model reproduces the daily humidity properly under the western synoptic advection...|$|R
