50|$|<b>Amprenavir</b> {{reached the}} market in 1999. It is an N,N-disubstituded amino-sulfonamide nonpeptide HIV {{protease}} inhibitor and shares some common features with previous protease inhibitors. It has a core {{similar to that of}} saquinavir but with different functional groups on both ends. On one end it has a tetrahydrofuran carbamate group and on the other end is an isobutylphenyl sulfonamide with an added amide. This structure results in fewer chiral centers, that makes it easier to synthesize and gives it enhanced aqueus solubility. That in turn gives better oral bioavailability. However, <b>amprenavir</b> was withdrawn from {{the market in}} 2004 since fosamprenavir, its prodrug, proved superior in many aspects.|$|E

50|$|After the {{discovery}} of HIV protease it only took 10 years for its first inhibitor to reach the market.

Four months later, two other protease inhibitors, ritonavir and indinavir, were approved.

5000|$|All the HIV {{protease}} inhibitors on {{the market}} contain a central core motif consisting of a hydroxyethylen scaffold, with the only exception being the central core of tipranavir, {{which is based on}} a coumarin scaffold. [...] A very important group on the HIV protease inhibitors is a hydroxyl group on the core motif which forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylic acid on the Asp-25 and Asp-25´ residues in the binding site. Hydrogen bonds between the water molecule, which is linked to Ile50 and Ile50', and carbonyl groups of the peptidomimetic inhibitors seem to connect them with the flap regions. On the other hand, on the nonpeptidic inhibitors, there is a proton acceptor which replaces the tetracoordinated water molecule and interacts directly with the two Ile50 residues on the flap of the enzyme. Specific pockets in the binding site of the HIV protease, often referred to as S1,S1',S2 and S2', recognize hydrophobic amino acids on natural substrates. The potency of inhibitors bearing hydrophobic groups complementing these areas is therefore increased. Some residues in the enzyme binding site are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with hydrophilic groups on the inhibitor, for example with the THF moieties on <b>amprenavir</b> and darunavir. Since darunavir has a bis-THF moiety, instead of a single THF moiety like on <b>amprenavir,</b> it can form more hydrogen bonds and increase binding energy.|$|E
50|$|Certain drugs {{require an}} acid stomach pH for absorption. Others require the basic pH of the intestines. Any {{modification}} in the pH could change this absorption. In {{the case of}} the antacids, an increase in pH can inhibit the absorption of other drugs such as zalcitabine (absorption can be decreased by 25%), tipranavir (25%) and <b>amprenavir</b> (up to 35%). However, this occurs less often than an increase in pH causes an increase in absorption. Such as occurs when cimetidine is taken with didanosine.

All subjects received <b>amprenavir</b> (1, 200 mg twice a day) for 4 days, followed by a 7 -day washout period, followed by either rifabutin (300 mg once a day [QD]) (cohort 1) or rifampin (600 mg QD) (cohort 2) for 14 days. Cohort 1 then received <b>amprenavir</b> plus rifabutin for 10 days, and cohort 2 received <b>amprenavir</b> plus rifampin for 4 days. Serial plasma and urine samples for measurement of <b>amprenavir,</b> rifabutin, and rifampin and their 25 -O-desacetyl metabolites, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Nineteen patients completed the study. The steady-state mean minimum plasma <b>amprenavir</b> concentration (Cmin,ss) was 1. 92 μg/ml for patients who received <b>amprenavir</b> and ritonavir without an NNRTI and 1. 36 μg/ml for patients who received <b>amprenavir</b> and ritonavir plus efavirenz. For patients who received amprenavir-ritonavir without an NNRTI, the steady-state mean peak plasma <b>amprenavir</b> concentration (Cmax,ss) was 7. 12 μg/ml, the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h (AUC 0 - 10) was 32. 06 μg[*]·[*]h/ml, and the area under the concentration-time curve over a dosing interval (12 h) at steady-state (AUCss) was 35. 74 μg[*]·[*]h/ml. Decreases in the mean values of Cmin,ss (29 %), Cmax,ss (42 %), AUC 0 - 10 (42 %), and AUCss (40 %) for <b>amprenavir</b> occurred when efavirenz was coadministered with amprenavir-ritonavir.

Absorptive <b>amprenavir</b> transport across Caco- 2 monolayers was determined using different apical conditions; <b>amprenavir</b> dissolved in buffered salt solution (10 µM) was used as control condition. The effect of the following apical media on permeability was evaluated: buffered salt solution enriched with d-&[alpha]-tocopheryl polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), Fasted State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FaSSIF) and blank human intestinal fluid (HIF) aspirated from the duodenum and jejunum of fasted volunteers. Also HIF aspirated after administration of a soft gelatin formulation of <b>amprenavir</b> (Agenerase&[reg]) was used. When studying <b>amprenavir</b> transport across Caco- 2 monolayers, the absorptive permeability coefficient (Papp) increased from 12. 8 ± 0. 4 · 10 - 6 cm/s for the control condition to 20 ± 2 · 10 - 6 cm/s when using FaSSIF or blank HIF as apical medium. Including verapamil in either of these conditions further increased transport, illustrating that <b>amprenavir</b> is a substrate of P-glycoprotein related efflux carriers. When using HIF aspirated after intake of the <b>amprenavir</b> formulation, a wide range in Papp values (8 · 10 - 6 - 25 · 10 - 6 cm/s) was obtained; inclusion of verapamil did not increase <b>amprenavir</b> transport.

On the basis of power model analysis, {{the increase in the}} maximum concentration of <b>amprenavir</b> in plasma (Cmax) was less than dose proportional, and the increase in the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0 –∞) was greater than dose proportional; mean slopes (with 90 % confidence intervals) were 1. 25 (1. 16 to 1. 35) and 0. 78 (0. 78 to 0. 86) for AUC 0 –∞ and Cmax, respectively. <b>Amprenavir</b> was eliminated slowly, with a terminal-phase half-life of 8 h. A second study was conducted to determine the bioavailability of the hard gelatin capsule relative to that of a subsequently developed soft gelatin capsule. The capsules were bioequivalent in terms of AUC 0 –∞ but not in terms of Cmax; geometric-least-squares means ratios (with 90 % confidence intervals) were 1. 03 (0. 92 to 1. 14) and 1. 25 (1. 03 to 1. 53) for AUC 0 –∞ and Cmax, respectively. Administration of soft gelatin capsules of <b>amprenavir</b> with a high-fat breakfast resulted in a 14 % decrease in the mean AUC 0 –∞ (from 9. 58 to 8. 26 μg · h/ml), which {{is not likely to be}} clinically significant. The most common adverse events related to <b>amprenavir</b> were headache, nausea, and hypesthesia. <b>Amprenavir</b> appears to be safe and well tolerated over the dose range of 150 to 1200 mg. On the basis of the present single-dose studies, <b>amprenavir</b> is an HIV protease inhibitor with favorable absorption and clearance pharmacokinetics that are only minimally affected by administration with food...|$|E
40|$|A phase I, open-label, dose-escalating {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single, oral doses of <b>amprenavir</b> (141 W 94), a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) protease, in 20 HIV-infected children 4 to 12 years of age. The doses of <b>amprenavir</b> evaluated, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg of body weight, were comparable to those evaluated in adult phase I and II studies. The most common clinical adverse event associated with <b>amprenavir,</b> administered as soft gelatin capsules, was nausea. <b>Amprenavir</b> was rapidly absorbed, with a mean time to maximum concentration (Tmax) occurring 0. 95 to 1. 58 h after dosing. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0 →∞) was dose proportional, and the mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increased linearly in a less than dose-proportional manner. <b>Amprenavir</b> was eliminated relatively slowly, with a mean terminal-phase half-life (t 1 / 2) of 6. 17 to 8. 28 h. The t 1 / 2, apparent total clearance, and apparent volume of distribution during the elimination phase were dose independent. Considerable interpatient variability was seen for all pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>amprenavir.</b> The {{results of this study}} suggest that 20 mg of amprenavir/kg administered twice a day should be used in future pediatric studies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Amprenavir</b> (141 W 94) is {{extensively}} metabolized by P 450 cytochromes, specifically, CYP 3 A 4. Because {{hepatic insufficiency}} reduces P 450 -mediated metabolism, the concentrations in plasma of drugs metabolized through this pathway are often increased {{in subjects with}} liver disease. Following administration of a single, oral dose of 600 mg of <b>amprenavir,</b> pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for 10 subjects with severe cirrhosis, 10 subjects with moderate cirrhosis, and 10 healthy volunteers. Model-independent methods for determining the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC 0 –∞) showed an increase in <b>amprenavir</b> AUC 0 –∞ of 2. 5 -fold in the group with moderate cirrhosis and 4. 5 -fold in the group with severe cirrhosis compared with that {{in the control group}} of healthy volunteers (P < 0. 05). AUC 0 –∞ was linearly related to the severity of liver disease, as assessed by the Child-Pugh score. Of the laboratory data used to calculate the Child-Pugh score, only the mean total bilirubin concentration showed a significant relationship with AUC 0 –∞. The relationship between the total bilirubin concentration and the AUC 0 –∞ of <b>amprenavir</b> was well characterized by a simple Emax model, suggesting that the total bilirubin concentration may be a useful parameter for predicting the <b>amprenavir</b> AUC in subjects with hepatic insufficiency. Finally, the sera of cirrhotic subjects showed significant decreases in the levels of α 1 -acid glycoprotein, the primary plasma binding protein for <b>amprenavir.</b> On the basis of the results of this study, for an exposure equivalent to a clinical dose of 1, 200 mg twice daily in subjects without cirrhosis, subjects with Child-Pugh scores of 5 to 8 should receive a twice-daily 450 -mg dose of <b>amprenavir,</b> and subjects with Child-Pugh scores of 9 to 15 should receive a twice-daily 300 -mg dose of <b>amprenavir...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{success of}} an antiretroviral salvage regimen containing protease inhibitors (PI) {{is limited by}} PI-resistant viral strains exhibiting various degrees of resistance and cross-resistance. To evaluate the extent of cross-resistance to the new PI <b>amprenavir,</b> 155 samples from 132 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected patients were analyzed for viral genotype by direct sequencing of the protease gene. Concomitantly, drug sensitivity to indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and <b>amprenavir</b> was analyzed by a recombinant virus assay. A total of 111 patients had been pretreated with 1 - 4 PI, but all were naive to <b>amprenavir.</b> A total of 105 samples (67. 7 %) were sensitive to amprenavir; 25 samples (16. 1 %) were intermediately resistant, and another 25 samples were highly resistant (4 - to 8 -fold- and > 8 -fold-reduced sensitivity, respectively). The mutations 46 I/L, 54 L/V, 84 V, and 90 M showed the strongest association with <b>amprenavir</b> resistance (P < 0. 0001). The scoring system using 84 V and/or any two {{of a number of}} mutations (10 I/R/V/F, 46 I/L, 54 L/V, and 90 M) predicted <b>amprenavir</b> resistance with a sensitivity of 86. 0 % and a specificity of 81. 0 % within the analyzed group of samples. Of 62 samples with resistance against 4 PI, 23 (37. 1 %) were still sensitive to <b>amprenavir.</b> In comparison, only 2 of 23 samples (8. 7 %) from nelfinavir-naive patients with resistance against indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir were still sensitive to nelfinavir. <b>Amprenavir</b> thus appears to be an interesting alternative for PI salvage therapy...|$|E
