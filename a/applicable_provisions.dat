This question was adjudicated by a special Supreme Court in a case filed by political gadfly John Jay Hooker.

40|$|Purpose: To explore conceptually and empirically the {{application}} of the concept of IT readiness to small firms. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire administered to small manufacturing business owners in the Liguria region of Italy. Data analysed using factor and cluster analysis. Findings: IT readiness concept appears valid with the emergence of three constructs: strategic vision; project management capability; and IT application infrastructure. The date analysis yielded four distinctive and varying profiles of small business owners. Research limitations/implications: Quantitative study exploring a cross section of small firms suggests antecedents to change have been ignored relative to IT adoption decisions. Practical implications (if <b>applicable)</b> <b>Provision</b> of policy and support services requires a much more nuanced approach to small businesses. Originality/value: Very few studies of IT Readiness in the literature, making the paper original in its intent.
