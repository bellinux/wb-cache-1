However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

5|$|As Chen {{was born}} in a culture other than the culture he now lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E

5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E

In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.|$|E
