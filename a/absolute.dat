40|$|The {{received}} {{view is that}} <b>absolutes</b> lead to monisms. However, {{this paper}} argues just the opposite: there is prevalent philosophical tradition in which <b>absolutes</b> demand a pluralistic world of experience. We will explore this tradition starting with ancient Jewish philosophy. We will move through the 17 th century rationalists and conclude by investigating how modern philosophies of language and science adopt a concept of <b>absolutes</b> that are only expressed in a pluralistic world...|$|R
5000|$|Kant {{claimed that}} everyone's reason {{leads them to}} assume three unconditioned <b>absolutes.</b> These are God, the soul, and the total world. The unconditioned <b>absolutes</b> are symmetrically derived by Kant from three kinds of {{syllogism}} {{as the result of}} three categories of relation.|$|R
5|$|A {{study of}} a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270mg per day {{estimated}} an average <b>absolute</b> risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated <b>absolute</b> risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within {{three months after the}} ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).|$|E
5|$|<b>Absolute,</b> relative, {{and fixed}} CSS {{positioning}}: <b>Absolute</b> positioning {{means that the}} web developer specifies the exact X and Y coordinates where an element is to be placed into the page. Relative positioning means that the web developer specifies an X and Y offset from the usual position of the element. Fixed positioning means that the element is placed relative to the browser window, and scrolls with the window rather than {{with the rest of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|According to Jainism, no single, {{specific}} statement {{can describe}} {{the nature of}} existence and the <b>absolute</b> truth. This knowledge (Kevala Jnana), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other beings and their statements about <b>absolute</b> truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.|$|E
50|$|Used in {{perfumery}} and aromatherapy, <b>absolutes</b> {{are similar}} to essential oils. They are concentrated, highly aromatic, oily mixtures extracted from plants. Whereas essential oils can typically be produced through steam distillation, <b>absolutes</b> {{require the use of}} solvent extraction techniques or more traditionally, through enfleurage.|$|R

5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an <b>absolute</b> magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an <b>absolute</b> magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.|$|E
5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their <b>absolute</b> magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their <b>absolute</b> magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E
5|$|At the opposite, the <b>absolute</b> chronological {{position}} of Neferhotep is debated with Ryholt and Baker seeing him respectively as the 26th and 27th pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty while Detlef Franke and Jürgen von Beckerath contend {{that he was}} only the 22nd ruler. Similarly, the <b>absolute</b> datation of Neferhotep's reign varies by as much as 40 years between the scholars, with Kim Ryholt dating the beginning of his reign c. 1740 BC and Thomas Schneider c. 1700 BC.|$|E

The re-release of <b>Absolutes</b> was self-produced by Barcelona and Brian Eichelberger, {{a close friend of}} the band and former member. Michael H. Brauer, a two-time Grammy winner for his work with artists such as Coldplay and John Mayer, mixed the album. The band has since parted ways with Universal Motown Records.
