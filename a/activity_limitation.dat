The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with early symptomatic knee OA and to describe characteristics of these subgroups. Methods Follow-up data over a period of 5 years of 697 participants with early symptomatic knee OA from the Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK) were used. <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were measured yearly with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Latent class growth analyses identified homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Multivariable regression analyses examined differences in characteristics between the subgroups. Results Three subgroups were identified. Participants in Subgroup 1 (?egood outcome?f; n= 330) developed or displayed slight <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> over time. Participants in Subgroup 2 (?emoderate outcome?f; n= 257) developed or displayed moderate <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> over time.

The aims {{of the present study}} were: 1) to assess whether BMI {{and depressed}} mood are independently associated with knee pain and activity limitations; and 2) to compare the relative contributions of BMI and depressed mood to knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Methods. A cross-sectional study in 294 patients with clinical knee OA. Regression analyses were performed with knee pain or <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> (self-reported and performance-based) as dependent variables, and BMI and depressed mood as independent variables. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, marital status, education level, radiographic OA and comorbidity. Dominance analyses were performed to examine the relative contributions of BMI and depressed mood to knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Results: BMI and depressed mood were positively and independently associated with knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> BMI and depressed mood explained small parts (3. 0 % and 2. 3 %, respectively) of variance in knee pain. BMI explained a substantial part of variance in both self-reported (9. 8 %) and performance-based (20. 4 %) <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> while depressed mood explained a small part of variance (3. 1 % in self-reported and 2. 6 % in performance-based <b>activity</b> <b>limitations).</b> Conclusions: In patients with knee OA both BMI and depressed mood seem to be independently associated with knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> The contribution of BMI to <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> is most substantial, thereby offering a relevant target for interventions. © 2013 Holla et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{patients}} {{diagnosed with}} Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type (EDS-HT) {{are characterized by}} pain, proprioceptive inacuity, muscle weakness, potentially leading to <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> In EDS-HT, a direct relationship between muscle strength, proprioception and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> has never been studied. The objective {{of the study was}} to establish the association between muscle strength and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and the impact of proprioception on this association in EDS-HT patients. Methods: Twenty-four EDS-HT patients were compared with 24 controls. <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were quantified by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Six-Minute Walk test (6 MWT) and 30 -s chair-rise test (30 CRT). Muscle strength was quantified by handheld dynamometry. Proprioception was quantified by movement detection paradigm. In analyses, the association between muscle strength and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> was controlled for proprioception and confounders. Results: Muscle strength was associated with 30 CRT (r = 0. 67, p = < 0. 001), 6 MWT (r = 0. 58, p = < 0. 001) and HAQ (r = 0. 63, p = < 0. 001). Proprioception was associated with 30 CRT (r = 0. 55, p < 0. 001), 6 MWT (r = 0. 40, p = < 0. 05) and HAQ (r = 0. 46, p < 0. 05). Muscle strength was found to be associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> however, proprioceptive inacuity confounded this association. Conclusions: Muscle strength is associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in EDS-HT patients. Joint proprioception is of influence on this association and should be considered in the development of new treatment strategies for patients with EDS-HT. Implications for rehabilitation : Reducing <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> by enhancing muscle strength is frequently applied in the treatment of EDS-HT patients. Although evidence regarding treatment efficacy is scarce, the current paper confirms the rationality that muscle strength is an important factor in the occurrence of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in EDS-HT patients. Although muscle strength is the most dominant factor that is associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> this association is confounded by proprioception. In contrast to common belief proprioception was not directly associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> but confounded this association. Controlling muscle strength on the bases of proprioceptive input may be more important for reducing <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> than just enhancing sheer muscle strength...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) have impaired physical function {{which can lead}} to difficulties with daily activities. Despite improved pharmacological treatment, patients with early RA report difficulties with activities involving the shoulder. There is limited knowledge of the shoulder function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand among patients with early RA. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate shoulder function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand, and the relationship between shoulder function, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and work ability in patients with early RA. A methodological study evaluated the reliability and validity for the Disability of the Shoulder,Arm and Hand (DASH) questionnaire which assess <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand. A controlled cross-sectional study and a crosssectional study investigated shoulder function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand and the relationship between shoulder function, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and work ability in patients with early RA. A randomized-controlled study evaluted moderately intensive pool exercise for patients with RA. Main findings. DASH was found to possess satisfactory reliability and validity to assess <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with early RA. The shoulder function was found to be impaired, in particular the shoulder muscle strength which was 65 % of the muscle strength in the reference group. The majority of the patients reported some <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder,arm and hand when compared with the reference group. Impaired work ability is common among patients with early RA and associated with impaired shoulder function, mechanical exposure and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand. Moderately intensive pool exercise improved muscle function in the upper and lower extremites, active range of motion of the shoulder, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and well-being in patients with RA, while the aerobic capacity did not improve. Long-term follow-up showed also improved physical and mental quality of life. Conclusion. Screening and monitoring of shoulder function from disease onset is warranted as the shoulder function is impaired, in particular the shoulder muscle strength. The majority of the patients with early RA report <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand. DASH can be used to monitor the progress of the upper extremity function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with RA.

40|$|Assessment in {{patients}} with NMD consists principally of measures of motor impairment since they are well known by clinicians and their measures do not require much equipment. The conventional treatments {{in patients}} with NMD are above-all focused on the diminution of motor impairments by maintaining or improving joint mobility, muscle strength and endurance. Nevertheless, a reduction of motor impairments does not directly lead to a higher ability in performing daily <b>activities.</b> Therefore, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> should be measured specifically. A new scale of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> was first developed in children and adults with NMD. The use of the Rasch model provided a scale to assess the fundamental psychometric qualities. Secondly, relationships between motor impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were investigated to verify the assumption that reduced motor impairments do not necessarily lead to higher activity levels. Finally, to complete the investigation of psychometric qualities, a longitudinal study of the developed questionnaire was carried out to evaluate its sensitivity to change. Chapter 1 presents the development of ACTIVLIM, a Rasch-built measure of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and its validation in children and adults with NMD. ACTIVLIM is a self-reported questionnaire that assesses the difficulties adult patients and parents of affected children perceive when they or their children perform daily activities. This questionnaire originally included 126 daily activities and was submitted to 369 patients. The Rasch model selected 22 daily activities to define a linear and unidimensional measure of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> {{in patients with}} NMD. The validity and the reproducibility of the results were also studied. A second section of Chapter 1 demonstrates why the measure of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in children with NMD as assessed using the ACTIVLIM questionnaire {{is based upon the}} perception of their parents. A third section of Chapter 1 compares the difficulties self-perceived by the patients with the difficulties observed by external examiners. The agreement between both measures is very good, indicating that the use of ACTIVLIM as a self-reporting questionnaire is a valid method to assess <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with NMD. Chapter 2 investigates the relationships between motor impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> as measured with the ACTIVLIM questionnaire. As the anatomical basis and pathophysiology are different from one NMD to another, the relationships between impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were investigated in six main diagnostic groups and in the whole sample without diagnostic distinction. Gait speed and muscle weakness in proximal and flexor muscle groups were significantly but moderately correlated to the <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> indicating that the latter cannot simply be inferred from motor impairments but should be independently measured and treated. 	 Chapter 3 investigates the sensitivity to change of the ACTIVLIM questionnaire. As NMD are progressive disorders, {{it is important that the}} ACTIVLIM questionnaire be able to assess the change over time in the activity level of patients with NMD in order to characterize the disease course and to quantify the effects of new treatments on <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in these patients.

5000|$|This {{classification}} is for disability athletics. This classification is one {{of several}} classifications for athletes with spinal cord injuries. Similar classifications are T51, T52, T53 and T54. [...] Jane Buckley, writing for the Sporting Wheelies, describes the athletes in this classification as: [...] " [...] Wheelchair athlete with normal arms and hands. No or limited trunk function. No leg function." [...] The Australian Paralympic Committee defines this classification as being for [...] "Athletes with normal upper limb function, with no abdominal or lower spinal strength (poor sitting balance). Some interference in their ability to perform long and forceful strokes. E.g. high level paraplegia." [...] The International Paralympic Committee defined this class in 2011 as [...] "These athletes will have normal arm muscle power with no abdominal or lower spinal muscle activity. Use different techniques to compensate for lack of abdominal musculature including lying horizontal. When the paces quickens in a race, their acceleration is slower than the T54 class. In general when acceleration occurs, the trunk rises off the legs {{due to a lack of}} abdominal muscles to hold the trunk down. Usually have to interrupt the pushing cycle to adjust the compensator. Equivalent <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> to person with complete cord injury at cord level T1-7." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{avoidance}} {{model in}} patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) hypothesizes that pain and psychological distress lead to avoidance of activities, and thereby to muscle weakness and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> This paper systematically reviews the scientific evidence for the validity of this avoidance model. A qualitative data synthesis was used to identify levels of evidence. Sixty studies were included. In knee OA, strong evidence was found that avoidance of activities is associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> via muscle weakness (mediation by muscle weakness), strong evidence was found for an association between muscle weakness and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> and weak evidence was found that pain and psychological distress are associated with muscle weakness via avoidance of activities (mediation by avoidance). In hip OA, weak evidence was found for mediation by muscle weakness; and strong evidence was found for an association between muscle weakness and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> More research is needed on the consecutive associations between pain or psychological distress, avoidance of activities and muscle weakness, and to confirm causal relationships...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the degree of}} impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and their interrelationship in complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS type I). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study interrelating impairments and objectively measured <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> SETTING: Ambulatory and home environment. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty nonacute upper-limb CRPS type I subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. Main outcome measures Sensory, motor, and autonomic impairments, as well as activity-limitation outcome measures. The latter were objectively measured with a novel upper-limb activity monitor (based on ambulatory accelerometry). RESULTS: All subjects were impaired to some degree but with a large variability with respect to magnitude. Regarding <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> the involved upper limb was clearly less active (lower intensity and percentage of activity) than the noninvolved side. Impaired active range of motion (adjusted R(2) range, 18 %- 39 %) and grip strength (adjusted R(2) range, 12 %- 45 %) {{were the most important}} factors explaining variance in <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: All subjects were still impaired nearly 3 years after the causative event. The involved upper limb was also clearly less active than the noninvolved side, especially when the subjects were sitting and when the dominant side was involved. The more impairments a subject had, especially motor impairments, the more <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were present...|$|R
40|$|Background : There {{are many}} factors that {{influence}} access to public health services, such as the context people live in, the existing health services, and personal, cultural and community factors. People with disabilities (<b>activity</b> <b>limitations),</b> through their experience of health services, may offer a particular understanding {{of the performance of}} the health services, thus exposing health system limitations more clearly than perhaps any other health service user. Aim : This article explores how <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> interact with factors related to context, systems, community and personal factors in accessing public health care services in South Africa. Setting : We present four case studies of people with disabilities from four low-resource diverse contexts in South Africa (rural, semi-rural, farming community and peri-urban) to highlight challenges of access to health services experienced by people with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in a variety of contexts. Methods : One case study of a person with disabilities was chosen from each study setting to build evidence using an intensive qualitative case study methodology to elucidate individual and household experiences of challenges experienced by people with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> when attempting to access public health services. In-depth interviews were used to collect data, using an interview guide. The analysis was conducted {{in the form of a}} thematic analysis using the interview topics as a starting point. Results : First, these four case studies demonstrate that equitable access to health services for people with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> is influenced by a complex interplay of a variety of factors for a single individual in a particular context. Secondly, that while problems with access to public health services are experienced by everyone, people with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> are affected in particular ways making them particularly vulnerable in using public health services. Conclusion : The revitalisation of primary health care and the introduction of national health insurance by the Health Department of South Africa open a window of opportunity for policy makers and policy implementers to revisit and address the areas of access to public health services for people with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations...</b>|$|R
