5|$|In 1894, Ross was {{appointed}} to {{a seat on the}} Railroad Commission of Texas. While he pondered whether to resign his position <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> appointment, letters and petitions poured into his office begging him to remain at Texas AMC. He declined the appointment and remained president of the college.|$|E
5|$|Although both Malaysia and Singapore {{had agreed}} to respect <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> ICJ's decision, Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking {{permission}} to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would wait to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E
5|$|Through his confession, Cobb makes {{peace with}} his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's {{projection}} and wakes Fischer {{up with a}} kick. Revived at the mountain hospital, Fischer enters a safe room to discover <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake {{on the plane and}} Saito makes a phone call.|$|E

5|$|For its 1908–09 {{season the}} Metropolitan {{management}} {{brought in the}} Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler, who made only 19appearances in the entire season. One of these was a much-praised performance of Smetana's The Bartered Bride on 19 February 1909. In {{the early part of}} the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra. This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with the opera house <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> conductorship of the re-formed New York Philharmonic. He continued to make occasional guest appearances at the Met, his last performance being Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades on 5 March 1910.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E

The Sejm also declared war on Muscovy, which had invaded the Commonwealth the previous fall.|$|E
25|$|Perfectionism {{is a prime}} {{cause for}} {{procrastination}} because demanding perfection usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy self-esteem and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, {{it is essential to}} recognize <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> power of failure without condemning, to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.|$|E

25|$|Khan's {{support to}} the Sayyid Brothers earned him the enmity of the rival Mughal nobleman Nizam-ul-Mulk.

In his final years, Khan sought {{inspiration}} from Sufi mystics and saints, veering towards spiritualism.

25|$|Following {{his release}} in June 1940 Holtermann did not resign <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> German {{occupation}} of his homeland but quickly became {{active in the}} fledgling Norwegian resistance movement. While officially spending the years 19401942 working as an office manager for Orkla Metall at Orkanger Holtermann continued resisting the Germans by being secretly active in the resistance movement. In 1942 his illegal activities were finally uncovered by the Germans and {{he was forced to}} escape across the border into neutral Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{qualification}} competition, George Graham, {{chairman of}} the Scottish Football Association (SFA), had said that Scotland would only travel to Brazil as winners of the Home Championship. (England, by contrast, had committed to attending, even if they finished in second place). After Scotland ended up in second place behind England, the Scottish captain George Young, encouraged by England captain Billy Wright, pleaded with the SFA to change its mind <b>and</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> place in Brazil; however, Graham refused to change his position and so Scotland withdrew from the tournament.|$|E
