5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion <b>attaching</b> the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue <b>attaching</b> to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure <b>attaching</b> at the duodenum.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{research}} is to assess whether performance on remembering faces with <b>attached</b> positive information and faces with <b>attached</b> negative information was enhanced when compared to faces with <b>attached</b> neutral information, or the control of faces with <b>attached</b> names only. It was hypothesised that likeability score would significantly differ for faces with <b>attached</b> positive information and <b>attached</b> negating information, an effect that was found in this research. In total, five measure of memory were used to assess the effect of <b>attached</b> social information on memory for faces- time taken to complete match pair grids, time taken between clicks on match pair grids, distance error on match pair grids, correct assisted name recall, correct assisted <b>attached</b> information recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> information recall. Three conditions were used (positive/neutral <b>attached</b> information, negative/neutral <b>attached</b> information and control condition) to measure the effect of mate relevant information on memory test scores. For the three match pair measures, no significant effect of <b>attached</b> mate relevant information was found. Non-significant results were found for correct assisted name recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> information, however for correct recall for <b>attached</b> information, a significant effect was found, suggesting that source memory of information can enhance subsequent memory for faces. Implications of research and future directions are discussed...|$|R

5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) <b>attaching</b> directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} the hairy ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula {{by the presence of}} a funiculus, a cord of hyphae <b>attaching</b> the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E

40|$|The general {{assumption}} {{has been}} that male batterers from clinical samples were mostly insecurely <b>attached</b> as compared to non-batterers. Recently, a large group was found (39. 4 % of batterers in a clinical sample) whose main attachment style was secure. No previous studies have examined specifically the securely <b>attached</b> batterer. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test whether antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), but not borderline personality disorder (BPD), traits may be related to battering among securely <b>attached</b> individuals. Twenty-seven securely <b>attached</b> batterers, 45 insecurely <b>attached</b> batterers, 40 securely <b>attached</b> controls, and 22 insecurely <b>attached</b> controls who lived in the Netherlands, filled in self-report measures of personality disorder traits (i. e., antisocial, narcissism, borderline) and attachment (i. e., avoidant and anxious). Results showed that ASPD traits explained 19 % of the variance of battering in securely <b>attached</b> individuals. NPD and BPD traits are related to battering among securely <b>attached</b> individuals when NPD and BPD traits were entered alone in the equation...|$|R
