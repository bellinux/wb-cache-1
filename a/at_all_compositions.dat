By monitoring features in the infrared spectra that are characteristic of the global conformation of the hydrocarbon chain, and hence can distinguish between stearate and oleate chains, it is shown that solid solution formation is realized {{by the introduction of}} gauche defects in a fraction of the stearate chains that are then no longer linear.

The rheological and thermal {{measurements of the}} pure copolymers and their blends (VLDPE 1 -LDPE 1, VLDPE 1 -LDPE 2, VLDPE 1 -VLDPE 2, and VLDPE 2 -VLDPE 3) were taken by controlled stress rheometry and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The shear-thinning effect became stronger with increasing long-chain-branched polymer compositions when it was correlated with the flow behavior index, {{and the extent of}} shear thinning was different for each blend set. Stronger shear thinning and a linear composition dependence of the zero-shear viscosity were observed for the VLDPE 1 -LDPE 1 and VLDPE 1 -LDPE 2 blends.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Protein {{families}} {{participating in}} protein-protein interactions may contain sub-families that have different binding characteristics, ranging from right binding to showing no interaction <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Composition</b> differences <b>at</b> the sequence level in these sub-families are often decisive to their differential functional interaction. Methods to predict interface sites from protein sequences typically exploit conservation as a signal. Here, instead, we provide {{proof of concept}} that the sequence specificity between interacting versus non-interacting groups can be exploited to recognise interaction sites. RESULTS: We collected homodimeric and monomeric proteins and formed homologous groups, each having an interacting (homodimer) subgroup and a non-interacting (monomer) subgroup. We then compiled multiple sequence alignments of the proteins in the homologous groups and identified compositional differences between the homodimeric and monomeric subgroups {{for each of the}} alignment positions. Our results show that this specificity signal distinguishes interface and other surface residues with 40. 9 % recall and up to 25. 1 % precision. CONCLUSIONS: To our best knowledge, this is the first large scale study that exploits sequence specificity between interacting and non-interacting homologs to predict interaction sites from sequence information only.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, ceramic solid {{solutions}} of (1 -x) SrTi 0 ₃-xBiSc 0 ₃ system with x= 0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 25, 0. 3, 0. 35, 0. 4, 0. 45 and 0. 5 have been synthesized via solid-state processing techniques. Final compounds {{of this system}} are not ferroelectric materials. The XRD analysis revealed that, <b>at</b> room temperature, <b>all</b> <b>compositions</b> under study (excepting pure SrTiOз) consist of mixture of the center-symmetric cubic Рm 3 m, phase and the polar tetragonal P 4 mm, phase. The EBSD mapping {{has been applied to}} image the two-phase structure. It was found that, fraction of the cubic phase decreases and fraction of the tetragonal phase increases when x arises. Anomalous behavior of dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses have been found for these samples which are specific for ferroelectrics with diffuse phase transitionyesBelgorod State National Research Universit...|$|R
