25|$|On 15 April 2012, at {{the annual}} Logie Awards, Meldrum was {{inducted}} into the Logie's hall of fame. In a recorded segment Elton John described him <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> more for the Australian music industry than anyone else. On 26 November 2014, Meldrum {{was inducted into the}} ARIA Hall of Fame, together with Countdown, by Marcia Hines and John Paul Young – Meldrum became the first non-artist to receive the accolade. He also became the second person to be inducted in both the Logie and ARIA Halls of Fame.|$|E
25|$|However, in English law, the {{decision}} in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968) is seen <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> away with the distinction, even though {{that was not the}} intention of the House of Lords. In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992), it was held that since Parliament only confers power on a public authority on the basis that it is to be exercised on the correct legal basis, any misdirection in law will render {{the decision}} ultra vires. Thus, in general, all errors of law are now considered as jurisdictional and ultra vires in a broad sense of the term, and the High Court can intervene to correct them.|$|E

25|$|Since it {{presumed that}} Congress's {{failure to act}} in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an {{implicit}} expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.|$|E
500|$|Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters, gave a {{positive}} review, noting the various new storylines {{and how the}} characters, especially Veronica, handled this new set of events. [...] "Like most adolescents, Veronica understands and anticipates this mix, even if she doesn't always deal {{with it in the}} most effective way. Even if you don't want to pick sides, you're bound to be assessed <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> so. And once you're labeled—09er or not—you can either spend your time fighting rumors or finding alternative measures. Veronica, so precociously and brilliantly aware of alternatives, makes this familiar process seem worth pondering one more time." ...|$|E
500|$|Goldacre {{is known}} for his [...] "Bad Science" [...] column in the Guardian, which he has written since 2003, and for his first book, Bad Science (2008). This unpicked the claims of several forms of {{alternative}} medicine, and criticized certain physicians and the media for a lack of critical thinking. It also looked at the MMR vaccine controversy, AIDS denialism, the placebo effect and the misuse of statistics. Goldacre was recognized in June 2013 by Health Service Journal <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> [...] "more than any other single individual to shine a light on how science and research gets distorted by the media, politicians, quacks, PR and the pharmaceutical industry." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with The Pitchfork Review, Björk expressed frustration {{over to the}} lack of recognition for all of her work on Vespertine and her other albums. She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> the whole album. [...] Drew [...] is a close friend of mine, and in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.|$|E
500|$|... "A Single Blade of Grass" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a A−, calling it [...] "yet another adventure in weird, Native American mysticism from {{the folks at}} 1013 Productions". VanDerWerff felt that although the episode contained several plot holes, it worked with [...] "a kind of dream sense, following its own weird, nightmare logic". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5. Gibron found that the episode contained several overly-unbelievable moments but was overall [...] "another great episode, even with some rather minor flaws". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "A Single Blade of Grass" [...] one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode was [...] "tedious", citing a lack of any real action and a [...] "banal" [...] ending which he described as having been poorly foreshadowed. However, Shearman felt positively about the episode's attempt to {{stand on its own}} rather than imitating sister show The X-Files, which he saw several prior episodes <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hordern cited Saint's Days {{negative}} publicity <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> his career [...] "the power of good" [...] as it {{brought him to}} the attention of the director Glen Byam Shaw, who cast him in a series of plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1951. Among the roles were Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As You Like It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. Hordern claimed to know very little about the bard's works and sought advice from friends about how best to prepare for the roles. The same year, he travelled down to Nettlefold Studios, Walton-on-Thames, to film Scrooge, an adaptation of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, in which he played Marley's ghost. Reviews were mixed with The New York Times giving it a favourable write-up, while Time magazine remained ambivalent. The Aberdeen Evening Express echoed the comments made by an American reviewer by calling Scrooge a [...] "trenchant and inspiring Christmas show". The author Fred Guida, writing in his book Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations: A Critical Examination in 2000, thought that Marley's ghost, though a [...] "small but pivotal role", was [...] "brilliantly played" [...] by Hordern.|$|E

500|$|The only tracks A.B. did not {{composed}} were [...] "Sukiyaki", [...] "Contigo Quiero Estar", and [...] "No Te Vayas". The {{latter was}} an original 1960s Japanese recording by Kyu Sakamoto. The lyrics Selena used were a Spanish {{version of an}} English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson. Keyboardist of Los Dinos, Ricky Vela and backup dancer Pete Astudillo helped with the translation of [...] "Sukiyaki"; Vela confessed in 2002 that his Spanish wasn't perfect and cited Astudillo <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> {{the majority of the}} songwriter for the track. Vela also said that he used a music sequencer and began [...] "elaborating" [...] Selena's music with the start of [...] "Sukiyaki". Selena's sister and drummer of the band, Suzette Quintanilla, said in 2002 that [...] "Sukiyaki" [...] was her favorite track off Selena. Texas Monthly called [...] "Sukiyaki" [...] a [...] "sentimental" [...] song. [...] "Contigo Quiero Estar" [...] was written by Mexican songwriter Alejandro Montealegre while [...] "No Te Vayas" [...] was written by Reinaldo Ornelas. Abraham called the recording a [...] "Tejano ranchera" [...] tune. The song was produced with a D50 synthesizer, handled by Joe Ojeda who joined the band a few days prior to the recording session of [...] "Contigo Quiero Estar". A.B. wanted [...] "No Te Vayas" [...] on the album because of its reggae feel, he thought it would make the album [...] "exotic" [...] from other Spanish-language albums that were released at that time. [...] "Tengo Ganas de Llorar" [...] was the last song recorded and included on Selena.|$|E
500|$|During {{the peace}} with France, after the Treaty of Amiens was signed on 25 March 1802, St Vincent ordered the Navy Board to begin an {{investigation}} for fraud and {{corruption in the}} Royal Dockyards. He swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their [...] "personal seal" [...] {{in anticipation of the}} Admiralty Board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection. The investigation began in earnest in 1802. St Vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. Some men were listed <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>done</b> work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. Others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the Receiving Ship. Work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections. In another yard, [...] "The men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means." [...] St Vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger corruption. He lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. The cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. This addendum removed the ability of the inquiry to act effectively in any way. The Commission of Inquiry produced twelve reports: ...|$|E

Within six weeks, he was home again, and over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to The Times, an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from [...] "witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr Harold Wilson" [...] and of the [...] "marine activities" [...] of Edward Heath. By then, he was describing himself as [...] "a recumbent nuisance." [...] He died on 11 November 1971, and obituaries were published in both The Times and Punch.
