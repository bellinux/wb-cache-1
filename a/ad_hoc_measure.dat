40|$|This paper investigates for the {{presence}} of a New Keynesian Phillips (NKPC) curve in Hungary in the period 1981 : 3 - 2006 : 2, following the methodology proposed by Gali and Gertler (1999). They claim that a potential source of inflation may be the sluggish adjustment of real marginal costs to movements in output. The empirical model we test features forward-looking firms who pre-set prices for a couple of periods ahead, using Calvo (1983) pricing rule. In addition, measures of real marginal cost are used instead of the old-fashioned output gap. The reason is that marginal costs are a better proxy for the impact of the productivity gains on inflation, which the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>measure</b> output gap misses. We also estimate a hybrid version of NKPC, where some of the firms are backward-looking, and others are forward-looking in their price-setting behavior. Real marginal costs and forward-looking behavior are statistically significant and quantitatively important in the NKPC. However, there are some econometric issues to be considered, such as the weak identification of the parameters of the structural NKPC {{as well as those of}} the hybrid NKPC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Presently, {{multiple}} options {{exist for}} conducting gene expression profiling studies in swine. In {{order to determine}} the performance of some of the existing microarrays, Affymetrix Porcine, Affymetrix Human U 133 + 2. 0, and the U. S. Pig Genome Coordination Program spotted glass oligonucleotide microarrays were compared for their reproducibility, coverage, platform independent and dependent sensitivity using fibroblast cell lines derived from control and parthenogenic porcine embryos. Results Array group correlations between technical replicates demonstrated comparable reproducibility in both Affymetrix arrays. Glass oligonucleotide arrays showed greater variability and, in addition, approximately 10 % of probes had to be discarded due to slide printing defects. Probe level analysis of Affymetrix Human arrays revealed significant variability within probe sets due to the effects of cross-species hybridization. Affymetrix Porcine arrays identified the greatest number of differentially expressed genes amongst probes common to all arrays, a measure of platform sensitivity. Affymetrix Porcine arrays also identified the greatest number of differentially expressed known imprinted genes using all probes on each array, an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>measure</b> of realistic performance for this particular experiment. Conclusion We conclude that of the platforms currently available and tested, the Affymetrix Porcine array is the most sensitive and reproducible microarray for swine genomic studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} shear flow of oil-in-water emulsion droplets {{in a thin}} sample chamber with a hopper shape. In this thin chamber, the droplets are quasi- 2 D in shape. The sample is at an area fraction above jamming and forced to flow with a constant flux rate. Stresses applied to a droplet from its neighbors deform the droplet outline, and this deformation is quantified to provide an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>measure</b> of the stress. As the sample flows through the hopper we see large fluctuations of the stress, similar in character {{to what has been}} seen in other flows of complex fluids. Periods of time with large decreases in stress are correlated with bursts of elementary rearrangement events ("T 1 events" where four droplets rearrange). More specifically, we see a local relationship between these observations: a T 1 event decreases the inter-droplet forces up to 3 droplet diameters away from the event. This directly connects microscopic structural changes to macroscopic fluctuations, and confirms theoretical pictures of local rearrangements influencing nearby regions. These local rearrangements are an important means of reducing and redistributing stresses within a flowing material.

40|$|The Boolean network {{paradigm}} {{is a simple}} and effective way to interpret genomic systems, but discovering the structure of these networks remains a difficult task. The minimum description length (MDL) principle has already been used for inferring genetic regulatory networks from time-series expression data and has proven useful for recovering the directed connections in Boolean networks. However, the existing method uses an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>measure</b> of description length that necessitates a tuning parameter for artificially balancing the model and error costs and, as a result, directly conflicts with the MDL principle’s implied universality. In order to surpass this difficulty, we propose a novel MDL-based method in which the description length is a theoretical measure derived from a universal normalized maximum likelihood model. The search space is reduced by applying an implementable analogue of Kolmogorov’s structure function. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on random synthetic networks, {{for which it is}} shown to improve upon previously published network inference algorithms with respect to both speed and accuracy. Finally, it is applied to time-series Drosophila gene expression measurements. Copyright © 2008 John Dougherty et al.

The main elements of the river rehabilitation for fish project promoted by the Modena Province concerning the middle course of the Panaro River (North Italy), a watercourse characterised by high naturalistic and environmental values but fragmented by several weirs built to prevent riverbed erosion, are presented in this paper.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{introduce}} novel measure of real marginal cost in the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) and compares its performance with conventional mea- sures such as output gap and labour share of income. Real marginal cost is derived from a flexible function whereas labour share is based on restrictive assumption of Cobb-Douglas technology. Dynamic correlations and results of NKPC indicate that real marginal cost is better than <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>measure</b> of output gap and labour share. Given the heterogeneity in price setting behaviour across sectors, cost functions and NKPC are estimated for the agriculture, manufacturing and other sectors of Pakistan's economy. Real marginal cost is derived from static and dynamic cost functions. In the presence of adjustment costs, dynamic cost functions that are consistent and integrated with their static systems are required. Such dynamic translog cost functions are estimated after testing the theoretical properties and existence of long term relationships in the static functions. Cost attributes, marginal cost, total factor productivity, technological progress, demand and substitution elasticities are derived from static and dynamic functions. Three specifications of forward looking and hybrid form of the Phillips curves are estimated with real marginal cost, output gap and labour share. Results indicate that hybrid specifications perform better than the forward looking models in terms of goodness of fit and statistical significance. Further, comparison of Phillips curves estimated with real marginal cost, output gap and labour share indicate that real marginal cost performs better in explaining inflation dynamics in Pakistan. The results indicate that forward looking behaviour dominates and high level of nominal rigidities persists in Pakistan. Finally, hybrid form of the NKPC is estimated for a panel of sixteen Asian economies. With the consideration of heterogeneity and aggregation bias, the mean group, random coefficient and weighted average coefficients are derived from individual estimates. The unobserved time variant common factors cause cross correlation in the errors that may lead towards inconsistent estimates. Therefore, cross section averages of the explanatory and the dependent variables are augmented in hybrid specification to capture the effect of latent variables. Findings suggest that the discount factor is almost 0. 94, the nominal rigidities are 33...|$|E
