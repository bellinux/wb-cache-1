500|$|The episode {{features}} both archival footage—as {{well as new}} footage—of Pam and Jim's wedding {{from the}} sixth-season episode [...] "Niagara". In {{order to get a}} shot of Pam and Jim looking into the camera, Greg Daniels restaged the scene four years after [...] "Niagara" [...] had been filmed. Daniels noted, [...] "To get Jim and Pam's eye line right for the camera, I stepped in as the minister [...] so they were both looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the full actor-power of all the emotions {{they were supposed to be}} feeling at their own wedding, just blasting in my face. I got chills and a fever." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahimsa as {{an ethical}} concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with {{discussing}} ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, {{but do not}} emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices {{and the concept of}} Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, [...] "may all beings look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{as though}} he were [...] "constantly trying to prove myself", Beck {{suffered}} a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity. In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way. Combined with the song's wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a [...] "one-hit wonder". At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of [...] "Loser". At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist [...] "played" [...] his char with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to [...] "Loser" [...] so that nobody could sing along. [...] "I can't tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking back <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> complete bewilderment—or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing—while performing during that period," [...] he later recalled. Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the Mellow Gold sound. Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded {{over the course of several}} years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became Odelay.|$|E

500|$|There are {{frequent}} references to Star Wars in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens. There is also reference to Star Wars when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In [...] "The Head and the Hair", Liz tells Jenna that [...] "The Head" [...] asked her out and says [...] "I had to say yes. I mean he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> those handsome guys eyes. It was like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon was...", until Jenna interrupts her and says [...] "No Liz, do not talk about that stuff on your date. Guys like that do not like Star Trek", to which Liz corrects [...] "Wars!". Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to executive producer and writer Robert Carlock, whom she described as [...] "the resident expert".|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 August 1942 Winston Churchill {{saw her in}} Stalin's private {{apartments in}} the Kremlin, {{describing}} her as [...] "a handsome red-haired girl, who kissed her father dutifully." [...] Churchill says Stalin [...] "looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{a twinkle in his}} eye as if, so I thought, to convey 'You see, even we Bolsheviks have a family life.'" ...|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> wildly, <b>with</b> {{a cry of}} terror. She saw my {{resolution}} in my face.|$|R

2500|$|After leaving lonelygirl15 in August 2007, Rose played [...] "Jen K." [...] on ABC Family's Greek.

2500|$|... "Well", she sighed, [...] "you {{see what}} we have been reduced to. We are now in a time when a Szell is {{considered}} a master. How small he was next to Furtwängler." [...] Reeling this disbelief -- not at her verdict, with which I agreed, but from the unvarnished acuteness of it -- I stammered, [...] "But how do you know Furtwängler? You never sang with him." [...] "How do you think?" [...] she stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> equal disbelief. [...] "He started his career after the war in Italy [...] I heard dozens of his concerts there. To me, he was Beethoven." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baer hardly {{trained for}} the bout. Braddock, {{on the other}} hand, was {{training}} hard. [...] "I'm training for a fight. Not a boxing contest or a clownin' contest or a dance", he said. [...] "Whether it goes 1 round or 3 rounds or 10 rounds, {{it will be a}} fight and a fight all the way... When you've been through what I've had to face in the last two years, a Max Baer or a Bengal tiger looks like a house pet. He might come <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a cannon and a blackjack and he would still be a picnic compared to what I've had to face." ...|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> searchingly <b>with</b> her clear grey eyes, without {{answering}} my reasonable question--my obvious, my unanswerable question.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face turned}} quite white, her rosy lips parted, {{and she looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> wildly <b>with</b> her {{beautiful}} dark eyes.|$|R

2500|$|... "I {{stood looking}} at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white {{students}} through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Tidwell {{would often}} return home from New York to Virginia Beach, to be [...] "rejuvenated" [...] and {{teach at the}} studio with his mother. [...] While still active in dance, Tidwell's career was losing focus, and his mother feared that he was losing his love for dance. That changed in late 2006 when the two went to see Tidwell's brother, Travis, perform in the So You Think You Can Dance tour in Madison Square Gardens. Travis had come in second place during the {{previous}} season, and was heavily featured in the touring show. His mother recalled, [...] "At Madison Square Garden, Danny looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{tears in his eyes}} and said, 'I want to do that. My brother's up there on that stage, dancing and living, and I want to do that.'" [...] The following season he attended the show's open auditions in New York City.|$|E

60|$|He turned with an oath, and {{followed}} his brother into the wood. Naomi's bright eyes looked up <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> flashing <b>with</b> indignation.|$|R
60|$|His tone {{made me feel}} not {{a little}} ridiculous. I {{knew that he was}} looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sideways, <b>with</b> a sardonic smile.|$|R
2500|$|In The Time Ships, Stephen Baxter's {{sequel to}} The Time Machine, the Time Traveller {{encounters}} his younger self via time travel. His younger self reacts with embarrassment to his older self's {{knowledge of his}} real names: [...] "I held up my hand; I had an inspiration. [...] "No. I will use—if you will permit—Moses." [...] He took a deep pull on his brandy, and gazed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> genuine anger in his grey eyes. [...] "How {{do you know about}} that?" [...] Moses—my hated first name, for which I had been endlessly tormented at school—and which I had kept a secret since leaving home!" [...] This is a reference to H.G. Wells's story [...] "The Chronic Argonauts", the story which grew into The Time Machine, in which the inventor of the Time Machine is named Dr. Moses Nebogipfel; the surname of Wells's first inventor graces another character in Baxter's book (see above).|$|E
2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Russian {{delegation}} is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|Among other songs is {{the ballad}} [...] "Speechless", {{which is a}} 1970s rock-inspired number that talks about abusive relationships: [...] "I can't believe how you slurred <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> your half-wired broken jaw". It {{consists}} of vocal harmonies and guitar riffs, which according to PopMatters, {{is comparable to the}} work of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Gaga's inspiration behind the track was her father's heart condition, and her fear about his death. Gaga recalled that her [...] "dad used to call after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there. I wrote this song as a plea to him." [...] Produced by Ron Fair, [...] "Speechless" [...] was recorded with all live instruments such as drums, guitars, bass and piano played by Gaga. The album's fifth track, [...] "Dance in the Dark", talks about a girl being uncomfortable having sex with the lights on, so she would prefer to perform it in the [...] "dark". Gaga has [...] "resolute" [...] vocals in the song, and the synths ultimately lead to the chorus where she belts, [...] "Baby loves to Dance in the Dark, 'Cause when he's looking she falls apart".|$|E
60|$|She {{waited for}} me to speak, and then irritated by my silence struck <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sharply <b>with</b> that wicked little tongue of hers.|$|R
60|$|He looked {{first at}} my hand, and {{afterwards}} <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then, <b>with</b> {{a sigh of}} relief, he took it and nearly wrung it off.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfect idiot," [...] {{she agreed}} warmly, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{straight}} <b>with</b> her wide-open, earnest {{eyes and the}} dimple of {{a smile on her}} cheek.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> fond, {{dark eyes}} and smiled incredulously.|$|E
60|$|The boy whistled softly. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> wide-open eyes.|$|E
60|$|She ceased, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> shining eyes for approbation.|$|E
60|$|The old worldling {{left the}} window, took a chair exactly {{opposite}} to mine, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> steadily, <b>with</b> a hard and vicious smile.|$|R
60|$|He raised himself, {{and stared}} upon my face. He could not speak, but, gibbering, he pointed <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then <b>with</b> a groan his spirit fled.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sidelong <b>with</b> a smile. “You see, you get copra,” she said, {{the same}} as you might offer candies to a child.|$|R
