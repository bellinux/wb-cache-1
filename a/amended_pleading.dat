50|$|Virginia {{pleading}} practice {{differs from}} that of federal courts and many other states in that it offers no amendments to the pleadings as of right. If a plaintiff files an amended complaint, and the defendant responds to that pleading, both the filing and the response are a legal nullity. A party must instead seek and receive leave to amend before any <b>amended</b> <b>pleading</b> will be accepted, even if that <b>amended</b> <b>pleading</b> is filed before any response to the initial pleading has been received. However, Virginia courts are generally liberal in allowing parties to amend, absent undue delay or prejudice to a party.|$|E
5000|$|Code {{pleading}} also drastically shortened the pleading process. Most {{of the old}} {{common law}} pleadings were abolished. From now on, a case required only a complaint and an answer, with an optional cross-complaint and cross-answer, and with the demurrer kept as the standard attack on improper pleadings. Instead of piling layers and layers of pleadings and averments {{on top of each}} other, a pleading that was attacked by demurrer would either be completely superseded by an <b>amended</b> <b>pleading</b> or would proceed immediately [...] "at issue" [...] as to the validly pleaded parts. This meant that to determine what the parties were currently fighting about, a stranger to a case would no longer have to read the entire case file from scratch, but could (in theory) look only at the most recent version of the complaint filed by the plaintiff, the defendant's most recent answer to that complaint, and any court orders on demurrers to either pleading.|$|E
40|$|The Court {{determined}} two issues: (1) {{whether the}} district court was correct in holding that an <b>amended</b> <b>pleading</b> must be dismissed {{because it was not}} filed with an affidavit and expert report required under Nevada law; (2) and whether the entire case must be dismissed or just the amended complaint must be dismissed under the meaning of “action. ...|$|E
50|$|Issues of <b>amending</b> to <b>plead</b> {{inconsistent}} {{facts or}} alternative facts were {{discussed in the}} English law case of Clarke v Marlborough Fine Art (London) Limited. In that case, the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division refused to allow an amendment to add additional claim that is inconsistent with the original claim as that will cause their pleading to state inconsistent facts. However, the court would have allowed <b>amending</b> to <b>plead</b> alternative facts because the claimant would not need to state that both sets of facts are true.|$|R

50|$|Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{interpreted}} Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) to require that federal courts grant a party leave to <b>amend</b> a <b>pleading</b> absent special circumstances such as bad faith or prejudice to the opposing party. It has been recognized by both other courts and secondary sources as a leading decision on the interpretation of Rule 15(a).|$|R

[...] James began, again feeling dimly that he {{had read}} enough pleadings, [...] "the {{defendants}} have filed an answer pleading that {{the will of the}} 22nd of December was not duly executed in accordance with the statute, and that the testator did not know and approve its contents, and an <b>amended</b> answer <b>pleading</b> that the said alleged will, if executed, was obtained by the undue influence of Augusta Smithers"--and once more his nervousness overcame him, and he pulled up with a jerk.|$|R
2500|$|The Court's {{observation}} {{that there was}} no substantive difference between allowing the State to amend its answer and simply dismissing sua sponte was characterized by Scalia as [...] "what appears to be the chief ground of its decision." [...] Scalia argued that if there was truly no [...] "dispositive difference" [...] between the alternatives, [...] "the natural conclusion would be that there is no compelling reason to disregard the Civil Rules. [...] Legislatively enacted rules are surely entitled to more respect than this apparent presumption that, when nothing substantial hangs on the point, they do not apply as written." [...] At a minimum, Scalia believed it [...] "a nontrivial value in itself" [...] to [...] "observe the formalities of our adversary system" [...] by requiring the State to <b>amend</b> its own <b>pleading.</b> [...] Scalia also observed that in contrast to the [...] "novel regime" [...] adopted by the majority, there is already a well-developed body of law regarding whether a party should have leave to <b>amend</b> a <b>pleading.</b> [...] "Ockham is offended by today's decision, even if no one else is." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{motion for}} leave is a motion {{filed with the}} court seeking {{permission}} to deviate from an established rule or procedure of the court. The most common use of a motion for leave is to seek an extension to an already-passed timeframe.To <b>amend</b> a court <b>pleading,</b> which is allowed once under the FRCP, to make changes of error made in title or body.|$|R
5000|$|In Corcoran, the {{district}} court denied defendants' motion to dismiss but granted their motion for a more definite statement on a copyright claim. Rather than amending the complaint, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, and {{the district}} court ultimately awarded defendants attorney's fees. The Ninth Circuit rejected plaintiff's contention that dismissal without prejudice does not confer prevailing party status under the Copyright Act, stating “Where, as here, a defendant has been put to the expense of making an appearance and of obtaining an order for the clarification of the complaint, and the plaintiff then voluntarily dismisses without <b>amending</b> his <b>pleading,</b> the party sued is the prevailing party within the spirit and intent of the statute even though he may, at the whim of the plaintiff, again be sued on the same cause of action.” ...|$|R
40|$|WWF-World Wide Fund for Nature v. World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc is {{the latest}} in a series of {{decisions}} concerning the right to use the initials “WWF” (“the Initials”). The activities of the disputants were patently incongruous; the claimant (the “Fund”) was a well-known charity engaged in a wide range of environmental conservation, while the defendant (the “Federation”) organized and promoted live wrestling matches. Anxious to avoid any injurious association that might arise from the Federation’s usage of the Initials, the Fund embarked on aggressive actions to impede such usage. In 1994, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (“the Agreement”) which severely restricted the Federation’s right to use the Initials worldwide. Subsequently, the Federation committed numerous breaches of the Agreement, against which the Fund successfully obtained injunctive relief as well as an order for damages to be assessed; but the trial judge rejected the latter’s application to <b>amend</b> its <b>pleading</b> (relying on Attorney-General v. Blake) to seek an account of the profits which the Federation derived from the infringing use of the Initials...|$|R
50|$|In {{the courts}} of England and Wales, under the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), a party is {{required}} to sign a statement of truth to verify facts in the case. Part 22 of the CPR contains the rules regarding the statement of truth. In 2001 case of Kelly v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, the claimant was allowed to <b>amend</b> her <b>pleading</b> {{at the end of}} the evidence phase to have an alternative pleading based on the evidence from the defendant side. In 2002 case of Clarke v Marlborough Fine Art (London) Limited, the court would allow pleading alternative facts. These were followed by the 2003 case of Binks v Securicor Omega Express Ltd, where the claimant submitted an amendment to the pleading {{at the end of the}} trial with another version of pleading that was contradictory to the original pleading. The trial court rejected the submission citing that Part 22 of the CPR would not allow conflicting versions of the complaint. However, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales disagreed and found that the purpose of Part 22 of the CPR is not to exclude the possibility of pleading inconsistent facts in the alternative. The series of these rulings showed that the requirement for a statement of truth does not prevent pleading alternative facts. In the past, there used to have rules for statements of case which expressly allow alternative facts. A guideline for drafting statements of case written in 2016 suggested that when raising the alternative facts, it should only be the case that the party understands that one of those sets of facts is true but does not know which. However, the alternative facts cannot be raised if the party has a knowledge to conclude that one of them must be a lie.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{pledging}} of Lawton and Stoke Lacy by Devereux’s father, Wiliam Devereux the Elder, for {{the ransom}} of Adam le Despencer, the Mortimer family had contested their restoration even following {{the payment of}} the redemption in 1275, and demanded another 500 marks. In 1278 Walter de Heliun and Walter de Hopton (sheriff of Staffordshire) were assigned to inquire into the dispute over Stoke Lacy, and in September of this year Devereux was ordered to yield Stanley, and Mortimer to yield Stoke Lacy. This did not occur, and the ongoing dispute led William Devereux to continue to withhold the manor of Stanley from Adam le Despencer. On 18 February 1278 the inquiry post-mortem of Henry de Penebrigg (Penebrug) showed that he held the rent of Cattelee worth 4L 16s 8d by the grant of William Devereux. On 29 September 1280 William Devereux sued Elizabeth, the widow of Henry de Penbrugge (Penebrug), over a messuage, mill, and three carucates of land, etc.; and £13 8s of rent in Stoke Lacy. Devereux claimed that Elizabeth had no entry except by a demise made by his father to Roger de Mortimer {{in time of war}} for the redemption of Adam le Despencer, and which should have reverted to him according to the provisions of Dictum of Kenilworth. Elizabeth claimed she did not hold the whole of the manor, and the suit was dismissed. The first stage of the litigation against Mortimer was withdrawn after William used a defective writ in Easter term 1284. The case was revived by an <b>amended</b> writ and <b>pleaded</b> again in Michaelmas term 1285. The case was revived a second time against Roger de Mortimer, Baron of Chirk who then vouched Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer in Michaelmas term 1290 and again at Hilary term 1291. In 1291 William Devereux filed a complaint with Parliament regarding the delay in the hearing of his plea by the Justices. They indicated that he had filed the plea incorrectly when it was described that Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer, and his father were on the same side during the conflict (Second Barons' War), but the King’s court indicated the parties were on opposing sides. Although, in fact they were on the same side at that point in the conflict, the justices were told to proceed as if they were on opposing sides. In 1292 William’s stepmother, the widow Maud (Giffard) Devereux, brought a writ of dower against Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer, and Mortimer vouched to warranty William Devereux by the deed of William’s ancestor. Devereux countered that he could not be bound by that deed as it was made in a time of war, between two battles, and was voided by the Dictum of Kenilworth. The Justices argued over whether the deed was valid if the King was imprisoned at the time, but ruled this was not a factor. The Justices then questioned whether the phrase “time of war” was to be understood only of opposing parties, as William Devereux’s father and Edmund Mortimer’s father were both on the same side at that time. Therefore it was not a ‘time of war’ for them. It was determined that other writs specified time only “in time of war,” but did not make any mention of opposite sides or of those who are on one side. Therefore the phrase was judged to be understood in a general sense, applying as well to one side as to both sides, and they established that the charter was made in time of war and the Dictum of Kenilworth applied. Judgment was for William Devereux and his stepmother, and he regained Stoke Lacy and yielded Stanley.|$|R
