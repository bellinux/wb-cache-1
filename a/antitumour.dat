5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{has been}} the subject of {{research}} into possible medicinal applications. Experiments in the 1980s concluded that two glucans isolated from the species showed potent <b>antitumour</b> properties when used on mice artificially implanted with Sarcoma 180 tumours. This was despite the conclusion of earlier research indicating that, while aqueous extracts from several other fungal species had <b>antitumour</b> effects, extracts from A.auricula-judae did not. Further, research on genetically diabetic mice showed that a polysaccharide extracted from A.auricula-judae had a hypoglycemic effect; mice fed with food including the polysaccharide showed reduced plasma glucose, insulin, urinary glucose and food intake.|$|E
5|$|French mycologist Pierre Bulliard {{described}} this species as Boletus felleus in 1788 {{before it was}} transferred into the new genus Tylopilus. It is the type species of Tylopilus, and {{the only member of}} the genus found in Europe. Tylopilus felleus has been the subject of research into bioactive compounds that have been tested for <b>antitumour</b> and antibiotic properties. Although not poisonous, it is generally considered inedible, due to its overwhelming bitterness.In Vietnam it's considered as a delicacy.This species often found in Phu Quoc island.|$|E
5|$|Compounds from T. felleus {{have been}} {{extracted}} and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a beta-glucan that was {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non-specific immunological response. In particular, it enhances phagocytosis, {{the process by which}} macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have <b>antitumour</b> effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, N-γ-glutamyl boletine, has mild antibacterial activity.|$|E
5|$|In the West, A.auricula-judae {{was used}} in folk {{medicine}} {{as recently as the}} 19th century for complaints including sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent. Although it is not widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century. Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as hot and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana, as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that A.auricula-judae has <b>antitumour,</b> hypoglycemic, anticoagulant and cholesterol-lowering properties.|$|E

25|$|The Eli Lilly natural {{products}} group found that alkaloids of the Madagascar periwinkle (Vinca rosea), originally {{discovered in a}} screen for anti-diabetic drugs, blocked proliferation of tumour cells. The <b>antitumour</b> effect of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine) was later shown {{to be due to}} their ability to inhibit microtubule polymerization alkaloys, and therefore cell division.|$|E
25|$|As p53 protein {{levels are}} usually kept low, one could block its {{degradation}} and allow {{large amounts of}} p53 to accumulate, thus stimulating p53 activity and its <b>antitumour</b> effects. Drugs that utilize this mechanism include nutlin and MI-219, which are both in phase I clinical trials. There are also other drugs that {{are still in the}} preclinical stage of testing, such as RITA and MITA.|$|E
25|$|Another drug class {{originating}} from the NCI was the camptothecins. Camptothecin, {{derived from a}} Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits topoisomerase I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little <b>antitumour</b> activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by kidney toxicity: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, irinotecan, won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval {{for the treatment of}} colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers.|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin, a platinum-based compound, was {{discovered}} by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing {{to try to explain}} this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental artifact — the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of carboplatin, a cisplatin derivative with broad <b>antitumour</b> activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.|$|E
500|$|Steroidal compounds, {{like those}} {{isolated}} from P.ellipsoideus, can have pharmacological or taxonomical applications; for instance, some {{can act as}} anti-inflammatories (including ergosterol) or inhibit tumour growth. The 2011 study concluded that, as P.ellipsoideus contained {{a large number of}} diverse steroidal compounds, there may be comparatively high pharmacological activity in the fungus; however, more research would be needed to confirm this. Later publications echoed this research, claiming that the fungus has [...] "potential medicinal functions". Research published in 2012 named fomitiporiaesterA, a natural furan derivative isolated from methanolic extract of P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies. The chemical, methyl 3,5-dioxo-1,3,5,7-tetrahydrobenzodifuran-4-carboxylate, displayed significant <b>antitumour</b> ability in a mouse model.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the terrestrial animals and amphibians described above, many marine animals have been examined for pharmacologically active natural products, with corals, sponges, tunicates, sea snails, and bryozoans yielding chemicals with interesting analgesic, antiviral, and anticancer activities. [...] Two examples developed for clinical use include ω-conotoxin (from the marine snail Conus magus) and ecteinascidin 743 (from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata). [...] The former, ω-conotoxin, is used to relieve severe and chronic pain, while the latter, ecteinascidin 743 is used to treat metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. [...] Other natural products derived from marine animals and under investigation as possible therapies include the <b>antitumour</b> agents discodermolide (from the sponge Discodermia dissoluta), eleutherobin (from the coral Erythropodium caribaeorum), and the bryostatins (from the bryozoan Bugula neritina).|$|E
