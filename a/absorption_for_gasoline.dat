25|$|As of 2010, {{the density}} of {{petroleum}} diesel is about 0.832kg/L (6.943lb/USgal), about 11.6% more than ethanol-free petrol (gasoline), which has a density of about 0.745kg/L (6.217lb/USgal). About 86.1% of the fuel mass is carbon, and when burned, it offers a net heating value of 43.1 MJ/kg as opposed to 43.2 MJ/kg <b>for</b> <b>gasoline.</b> However, due to the higher density, diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density at 35.86 MJ/L (128,700BTU/USgal) vs. 32.18 MJ/L (115,500BTU/USgal) <b>for</b> <b>gasoline,</b> some 11% higher, which should be considered when comparing the fuel efficiency by volume. The CO2 emissions from diesel are 73.25 g/MJ, just slightly lower than <b>for</b> <b>gasoline</b> at 73.38 g/MJ.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the {{dispenser}} <b>for</b> <b>gasoline</b> {{there exist}} three problems: excessive pressure caused by water hammer, inadequacy of oil-gas separation and cavitation. A pressure test {{system of the}} dispenser <b>for</b> <b>gasoline</b> is established by using pressure transducers and a digital signal acquisition system. Results show that the pressure test system can not only conduct real-time and reliable diagnosis of the dispenser pressure, but also provide guideline on its performance optimization...|$|R

40|$|The {{determinates}} of {{the demand}} for transportation fuels interest many researchers and policymakers who are considering various energy plans. This paper uses a random coefficient regression approach to estimate the demand <b>for</b> <b>gasoline,</b> diesel fuel and jet fuel. For these three fuels a flow adjustment specification is assumed and <b>for</b> <b>gasoline</b> demand a stock adjustment model is also estimated. Individual European country data are used as the data because these data contain wide variations in the price variables, due to the different tax structures of the individual countries. These data are averaged across countries and time to produce firm estimates of the price and income elasticities of demand. <b>For</b> <b>gasoline</b> demand the estimates obtained from the European data are compared with estimates made by other researchers for the United States. ...|$|R
30|$|Global demand <b>for</b> <b>gasoline</b> is {{affected}} by technological change, global population growth, motor vehicle ownership and heating oil consumption. Since the last decade, we can clearly observe that gasoline prices are highly volatile and this makes price modelling and forecasting, and risk management very challenging. Global warming and greenhouse gas emissions interact with the demand <b>for</b> <b>gasoline.</b> However, political instability in the oil-producing countries caused a remarkable disruption in energy supply, market equilibrium and prices since the 1990 s.|$|R
