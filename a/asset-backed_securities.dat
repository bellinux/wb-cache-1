5000|$|A collateralized debt {{obligation}} (CDO) {{is a type}} of structured <b>asset-backed</b> <b>security</b> (ABS). [...] Originally {{developed for}} the corporate debt markets, over time CDOs evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgage-backed security ("MBS") markets.|$|R

50|$|The {{bill would}} qualify a {{structured}} finance swap activity for the exemption if: (1) it is undertaken for hedging or risk management purposes, or (2) each <b>asset-backed</b> <b>security</b> underlying the structured finance swap is of a credit quality {{and of a}} type or category with respect to which the prudential regulators have jointly adopted rules authorizing such a swap or security-based swap activity by covered depository institutions.|$|R
25|$|In public statements, Goldman {{claimed that}} it shorted simply to hedge {{and was not}} expecting the CDOs to fail. It also denied that its investors were unaware of Goldman's bets against the {{products}} it was selling to them. There were intricate links between a Goldman Sachs trader, Jonathan M.

25|$|The market also {{follows the}} {{benefits}} from ratings that result from government regulations (see below), which often prohibit financial institutions from purchasing securities rated below a certain level. For example, in the United States, in accordance with two 1989 regulations, pension funds are prohibited from investing in <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> rated below A, and savings and loan associations from investing in securities rated below BBB.|$|E
25|$|The law {{required}} {{credit risk}} retention regulations (where 5% {{of the risk}} was retained) within nine months of enactment,. Proposals had been highly criticized due to restrictive definitions on 'qualified residential mortgages' with restrictive down-payment and debt-to-income requirements. In the August 2013 proposal, the 20% down-payment requirement was dropped. In October 2014, six federal agencies (Fed, OCC, FDIC, SEC, FHFA, and HUD) finalized their joint <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> rule.|$|E
50|$|Overcollateralization (OC) is a {{commonly}} used form of credit enhancement. With this support structure, the face {{value of the}} underlying loan portfolio {{is larger than the}} security it backs, thus the issued security is overcollateralized. In this manner, even if some of the payments from the underlying loans are late or default, principal and interest payments on the ABS (<b>asset-backed</b> <b>security)</b> can still be made.|$|R
40|$|Famous {{musician}} David Bowie {{just passed}} away. While most people remember {{him for his}} music, he is also famous in the finance area.

In recognition, this type of asset is often referred to as a 2 ̆ 2 Bowie-bond. 2 ̆ 2 See article here, Bloomberg...|$|R
25|$|In many locations, PV {{has reached}} grid parity, {{which is usually}} defined as PV {{production}} costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). However, in many countries {{there is still a}} need for more access to capital to develop PV projects. To solve this problem securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects. For example, SolarCity offered, the first U.S. <b>asset-backed</b> <b>security</b> in the solar industry in 2013.|$|R
25|$|Securitization is {{the process}} of {{creating}} <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> by transferring assets from the issuing company to a bankruptcy remote entity. Credit enhancement is an integral component of this process as it creates a security that has a higher rating than the issuing company, which allows the issuing company to monetize its assets while paying a lower rate of interest than would be possible via a secured bank loan or debt issuance by the issuing company.|$|E
25|$|The {{servicer}} {{can significantly}} affect the cash flows to the investors because it controls the collection policy, which influences the proceeds collected, the charge-offs and the recoveries on the loans. Any income remaining after payments and expenses is usually accumulated {{to some extent}} in a reserve or spread account, and any further excess is returned to the seller. Bond rating agencies publish ratings of <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> based {{on the performance of}} the collateral pool, the credit enhancements and the probability of default.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> for loan originators (with associated disadvantages for investors) {{is that they}} bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. The tranching of these securities into instruments with theoretically different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons.|$|E
50|$|As of 31 December 2011, QFIL was 70% {{owned by}} CAA Sports International LLC (CAA), CAA {{director}} O'Connor and Michael Levine (co-head of CAA Sports) held 15% each. QFIL borrowed money from Quality Sports Investments LP as <b>asset-backed</b> <b>security</b> and later Quality Sports II Investments LP (QSI II) {{to purchase the}} economic rights of the transfer fee receivables of the footballers (coined ERPA: Economic Rights Participation Agreement), made the company an intermediate holding company with €100 net equity (the original share capital), or a shell company. The companies were associated with Quality Sports Jersey GP Limited (QSI GP) and Quality Sports II Jersey GP Limited (QSI II GP). QSI GP and QSI II GP were 50% owned by CAA.|$|R
2500|$|An <b>asset-backed</b> <b>{{security}}</b> (ABS) is {{a security}} whose income payments and hence value {{are derived from}} and collateralized (or [...] "backed") by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets which are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them {{to be sold to}} general investors, a process called [...] securitization, and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. The pools of underlying assets can include common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage loans, to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases, royalty payments and movie revenues.|$|R
40|$|Estimates {{of average}} default probabilities for borrowers {{assigned}} to each of a financial institution's internal credit risk rating grades are crucial inputs to portfolio credit risk models. Such models are increasingly used in setting financial institution capital structure, in internal control and compensation systems, in <b>asset-backed</b> <b>security</b> design, and are being considered for use in setting regulatory capital requirements for banks. This paper empirically examines properties of the major methods currently used to estimate average default probabilities by grade. Evidence of potential problems of bias, instability, and gaming is presented. With care, and perhaps judicious application of multiple methods, satisfactory estimates may be possible. In passing, evidence is presented about other properties of internal and rating-agency ratings. Credit; Risk management; Credit ratings...|$|R
25|$|Governments issue {{government}} bonds {{in their own}} currency and sovereign bonds in foreign currencies. State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects or other major spending initiatives. Debt issued by government-backed agencies is called an agency bond. Companies can issue a corporate bond or obtain money from a bank through a corporate loan. Preferred stocks {{share some of the}} characteristics of fixed interest bonds. Securitized bank lending (e.g. credit card debt, car loans or mortgages) can be structured into other types of fixed income products such as ABS – <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> which can be traded on exchanges just like corporate and {{government bonds}}.|$|E
25|$|Securitization is the {{financial}} practice of pooling {{various types of}} contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> (ABS).|$|E
25|$|As {{estimated}} by the Bond Market Association, in the United States, the total amount outstanding {{at the end of}} 2004 was $1.8 trillion. This amount was about 8 percent of total outstanding bond market debt ($23.6 trillion), about 33 percent of mortgage-related debt ($5.5 trillion), and about 39 percent of corporate debt ($4.7 trillion) in the United States. In nominal terms, over the previous ten years (1995–2004) ABS amount outstanding had grown about 19 percent annually, with mortgage-related debt and corporate debt each growing at about 9 percent. Gross public issuance of <b>asset-backed</b> <b>securities</b> was strong, setting new records in many years. In 2004, issuance was at an all-time record of about $0.9 trillion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical study, which assesses the historical performance of credit rating agency (CRA) ratings for securitizations {{before and during}} the financial crisis. The paper finds that CRAs do not sufficiently address the systematic risk of the underlying collateral pools as well as characteristics of the deal and tranche structure in their ratings. The paper also finds that impairment risk is understated during origination years and years with high securitization volumes when CRA fee revenue is high. The mismatch between credit ratings of securitizations and their underlying risks has been suggested as one source of the Global Financial Crisis, which resulted in the criticism of models and techniques applied by CRAs and misaligned incentives due to the fees paid by originators. <b>Asset-backed</b> <b>Security,</b> Credit Rating Agency, Collateralized Debt Obligation, Economic Downturn, Fee Revenue, Forecasting, Global Financial Crisis, Home Equity Loans, Impairment, Mortgage-backed Security, Rating, Securitization...|$|R
40|$|In this {{discussion}} of risk analysis and market valuation of collateralized debt obligations, we illustrate {{the effects of}} correlation and prioritization on valuation and discuss the “diversity score ” (a measure {{of the risk of}} the CDO collateral pool that has been used for CDO risk analysis by rating agencies) in a simple jump diffusion setting for correlated default intensities. collateralized debt obligation is an <b>asset-backed</b> <b>security</b> whose underlying collat-eral is typically a portfolio of (corporate or sovereign) bonds or bank loans. A CDO cash flow structure allocates interest income and principal repayments from a collateral pool of dif-ferent debt instruments to a prioritized collection of CDO securities, which we call “tranches. ” Although many forms of prioritization exist, a stan-dard prioritization scheme is simple subordination: Senior CDO notes are paid before mezzanine and lower subordinated notes are paid, with any resid-ual cash flow paid to an equity piece. We provide some examples of prioritization later in this article...|$|R
