5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction}} of the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect {{smell and}} taste, and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
5|$|Metroid II: Return of Samus is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Game Boy handheld game console. The second installment and the first handheld title in the Metroid series, it was released in North America in November 1991, and in Japan and Europe the following year. The story follows the protagonist and playable character Samus Aran, who is sent {{on a mission to}} exterminate the Metroid creatures from their home planet SR388 before the antagonistic Space Pirates obtain <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b> The gameplay involves killing a fixed number of Metroids before the player can advance deeper through the planet's tunnels.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E

Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him {{to take part in}} one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake {{about the nature of the}} relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E
5|$|As {{operations}} continued {{throughout the}} month, casualties amongst the Australian Corps became critical {{and the decision}} was made to disband some of the 3rd Division's battalions <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to reinforce the remaining units. This decision saw the reduction of the strength of division's infantry brigades from four battalions to three, bringing the Australians into line with the British, who had made a similar decision earlier in the war. Nevertheless, the decision was not popular amongst the soldiers and when the 42nd Battalion received the order to disband, the attempt was rejected by its personnel and the order disobeyed. As a result, the proposed reorganisation was postponed until after the division's final offensive actions were fought in early October 1918. These came around the St Quentin Canal when the division attacked the Beaurevoir Line in concert with American troops from the US 27th Division, who would lead the assault in. The attack went awry, however, when the lead assault units failed to adequately clear the forward positions and subsequently when the 3rd Division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through the American positions, they had to complete the mopping up process before they could advance. Nevertheless, by nightfall on 1 October, the division had captured the northern end of the tunnel that ran under the canal.|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to home in on their hosts.|$|E

5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E
