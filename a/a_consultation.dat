40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>A</b> pre-colonoscopy <b>consultation</b> in {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) screening {{is necessary to}} assess a screenee’s general health status and to explain benefits and risks of screening. The first option allows for personal attention, whereas <b>a</b> telephone <b>consultation</b> does not require travelling. We hypothesised that <b>a</b> telephone <b>consultation</b> would lead to higher response and participation in CRC screening compared with <b>a</b> face-to-face <b>consultation.</b> METHODS: <b>A</b> total of 6600 persons (50 – 75 years) were 1 : 1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with <b>a</b> pre-colonoscopy <b>consultation</b> either face-to-face or by telephone. In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended <b>a</b> pre-colonoscopy <b>consultation</b> (response) {{and the number of}} those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening. A questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the consultation and expected burden of the colonoscopy (scored on five-point rating scales) was sent to invitees. Besides, a questionnaire to assess the perceived burden of colonoscopy was sent to participants, 14 days after the procedure. RESULTS: In all, 3302 invitees were allocated to the telephone group and 3298 to the face-to-face group, of which 794 (24 %) attended <b>a</b> telephone <b>consultation</b> and 822 (25 %) <b>a</b> face-to-face <b>consultation</b> (P 0. 41). Subsequently, 674 (20 %) participants in the telephone group and 752 (23 %) in the face-to-face group attended colonoscopy (P 0. 018). Invitees and responders in the telephone grou...|$|R

5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of the database, the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began <b>a</b> <b>consultation</b> on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design the database. On 15 February 2007, the database was renamed from Information Sharing Index to ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, including children and families, who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of the database was: to improve communication between those working with children. <b>A</b> <b>consultation</b> on a guide for database users was launched on 4 May 2007 and ended on 27 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|A girl born at {{the station}} in 1924 was the first baby to be born on the Underground network. The Bakerloo line {{building}} remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The Northern line building was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, and was rebuilt several times until the current structure opened in 2003. Transport for London (TfL) is currently planning a major upgrade to the station. A Bakerloo line extension south to Camberwell was planned and approved in 1931 but construction never started. Similar proposals have been revived on several occasions; in 2014 TfL ran <b>a</b> <b>consultation</b> on an extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction, which is still under consideration.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{predictive}} {{validity of the}} perceived limitations in activities and need questionnaire (PLAN-Q), a screening instrument to support neurologists to select patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) for referral for <b>a</b> one-off <b>consultation</b> by occupational therapist (OT), physical therapist (PT) and speech therapist (ST). METHODS: In a cross-sectional validation study, 102 patients with various NMD participated. Patients received <b>a</b> one-off <b>consultation</b> by <b>an</b> expert OT, PT and ST and filled out the PLAN-Q. Therapists rated {{the appropriateness of the}} one-off consultations based on need, available treatment and patient's motivation. Receiver Operation Characteristic analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to obtain a PLAN-Q based prediction model for the appropriateness of the one-off consultations. RESULTS: Probability for <b>a</b> one-off OT <b>consultation</b> increased from 64 % to 78 % (95 % CI: 69 - 85 %). Prior test probability for <b>a</b> one-off ST <b>consultation</b> increased from 44 % to 61 % (95 % CI: 48 - 73 %). Prior test probability for one-off PT consultation could not be increased. CONCLUSION: Screening patients with NMD using the PLAN-Q may assist neurologists in selecting the appropriate patients for <b>a</b> one-off <b>consultation</b> by OT and ST. Unlike our expectations the screening did not guide referral for <b>a</b> one-off <b>consultation</b> by PT...|$|R

5|$|During 2005–06, a Bakerloo {{extension}} {{was proposed}} with three route options. The options were extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran <b>a</b> <b>consultation</b> on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension options later on.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. Some {{communities}} supported the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons.

Local leaders began calling for <b>a</b> <b>Consultation</b> to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{international}} fixtures, Arsenal {{did not play}} another game for two weeks. On the resumption of club football, they travelled across London to face Fulham. Vieira made {{his return to the}} first team in place of Fàbregas. Fulham was awarded a penalty in the first half, after Ashley Cole brought down striker Andy Cole in the penalty area. Referee Mark Halsey however changed his mind after protests from the Arsenal players and <b>a</b> <b>consultation</b> with his assistant; the game was restarted with a dropped-ball. Arsenal scored three times in the second half and ended the weekend of 6 September 2004 top of the league table, two points clear of second place Chelsea. The league champions dropped their first points of the season at home to Bolton Wanderers. At the City of Manchester Stadium on 25 September 2004, a goal by Cole earned Arsenal a 1–0 win against Manchester City. Journalist Russell Thomas, writing for The Guardian, commented on Arsenal's fatigue during the second half and opined that the team needed to keep their focus against sterner opposition.|$|E
5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and <b>a</b> <b>consultation</b> with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, 800 protesters {{embarked}} on a protest march from Trinidad to La Paz, on the way facing violent conflict from police and those who supported the road, with many being injured. The controversy caused two government officials and various other high-ranking officials to resign in protest, while Morales begged forgiveness but blamed the U.S. and Bolivia's right-wing for stirring up the unrest. In October 2011, he passed Law 180, prohibiting further road construction, although the government proceeded with <b>a</b> <b>consultation,</b> eventually gaining the consent of 55 of the 65 communities in TIPNIS to allow the highway to be built, albeit {{with a variety of}} concessions; construction was scheduled to take place after the 2014 general election.
