The video was critically applauded and received further attention when it got projected for one month in Times Square in 2013, and then across the 7 continents. Björk promoted the song by performing it throughout her Biophilia Tour.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of <b>an</b> <b>accordion.</b> Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held <b>an</b> <b>accordion</b> on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E

So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of <b>an</b> <b>accordion</b> {{is only a}} partly automated process.

25|$|Woodblock {{printing}} {{also changed}} {{the shape and}} structure of books. Scrolls were gradually replaced by concertina binding (經摺裝) from the Tang period onward. The advantage {{was that it was}} now possible to flip to a reference without unfolding the entire document. The next development known as whirlwind binding (xuanfeng zhuang 旋風裝) was to secure the first and last leaves to a single large sheet, so that the book could be opened like <b>an</b> <b>accordion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{music is}} usually played by trios playing <b>an</b> <b>accordion</b> and two guitars in bands called “cochi”, in styles such as corridos, waltzes, polkas and mazurkas along with norteño.

This is most often seen at festivals where traditional dances such as Las Pitahayas, El Conejo, El Apasionado, El Chaverán, La Yuca, La Cuera, Las Calabazas and El Tupé are performed.|$|E
25|$|The bellows is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} part of the instrument, and the primary means of articulation. Similar to a violin's bow, the production of sound in <b>an</b> <b>accordion</b> is {{in direct proportion to}} the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from pleated layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal. It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal reeds and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.|$|E

The Kolos usually last for about 5–13 minutes. Modern accordionists include Mirko Kodić and Ljubiša Pavković. Some kolos {{are similar to the}} Hungarian csárdás in that they are slow at the onset and gradually increase their speed until reaching a climax towards the end.|$|E
25|$|In June of {{the same}} year, Garcia {{graduated}} from the local Menlo Oaks school. He then moved with his family back to San Francisco, where they lived in an apartment above the newly built bar, the old one having previously been torn down {{to make way for}} a freeway entrance. Two months later, on Garcia's fifteenth birthday, his mother bought <b>an</b> <b>accordion</b> for him, to his great disappointment. Garcia had long been captivated by many rhythm and blues artists, especially Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley: his one wish at this point was to have an electric guitar. After some pleading, his mother exchanged the accordion for a Danelectro with a small amplifier at a local pawnshop. Garcia's stepfather, who was somewhat proficient with instruments, helped tune his guitar to an unusual open tuning.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} scratch band ensemble varied, {{but always}} used a percussive instrument, either the squash, tambourine, or a local form of double-headed barrel drum {{similar to the}} Dominican tambora, as well as <b>an</b> <b>accordion,</b> cane flute or violin as a melodic instrument. String instruments were also common, including the banjo, ukulele or a six-string guitar. The ass pipe, made out of a car exhaust tube, often provided the bass, and was played similar to the tuba. Since about the 1980s, the instrumentation for scratch bands became more rigid. The alto saxophone became the most common melodic instrument, replaced sometimes by a silver flute. Conga drums, squash, electric guitar or bass guitar, and a steel (a triangle). Banjo or ukulele, keyboard and additional saxophones or other melodic instruments are more rarely found in modern bands.|$|E
