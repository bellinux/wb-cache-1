The laser range sensor mounted on the robot then scans the vicinity of the stay holding the P-Gear. The A-Gear and P-Gear are separated by 300 – 500  mm. At 500  mm separation, the distance accuracy of the laser range sensor (± 10  mm) is <b>almost</b> <b>maintained</b> while the horizontal resolution is below 5  mm. The stay is covered by flat plastic plates of thickness 5  mm. By laser-scanning the front facing plate of the stay, the system precisely determines the straight line across the face (within an angular deviation of several degrees) by applying LSM algorithm to the measured range data. The deviation angle between the A-Gear and P-Gear is then obtained. We emphasize that the necessary system localization for gear meshing can be achieved by equipping a commercial indoor robot with an adequate sensor.|$|E
40|$|Interconnection {{networks}} {{have been studied}} to connect a number of processing elements on parallel computers. Their design increasingly includes a challenge to high faulttolerance, as entire systems become complicated. This paper presents a partial irregular-network routing {{in order to provide}} a high fault-tolerance in k-ary n-cube networks. Since an irregular-network routing usually performs poorly in k-ary n-cube networks, it is only used for progressive deadlock-recovery, and avoiding hard failures. The network is logically divided into the fault and regular regions. In the regular region, most packets are transferred along fully adaptive paths that are computed, assuming that there are no hard failures, so as to uniformly distribute the traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed routing achieves the same throughput as that of Duato’s protocol under no hard failures. As the number of faulty links increases to up to 8 on 256 nodes, its throughput is only decreased by 15 %. Moreover, the throughput of the proposed deadlockrecovery routing is <b>almost</b> <b>maintained</b> during a dynamic reconfiguration...|$|E

Although these approaches are effective, they do not always offer the desired level of analysis, especially when this level is between the resolutions of the models available. In this paper, we aim at offering a finer method in exploring this tradeoff by introducing an intermediate level between two given resolutions, which can apply to all agent models and allows a more progressive transition to offer the desired level of analysis. We introduce a framework for such a methodology and evaluate it through the extension of an existing approach, along two criteria: its impact on computational resources, and {{an estimate of the}} dissimilarity between a simulation using our methodology and one without.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{ignition}} delay time gap is newly studied. The operational characteristics of the linked two pyrotechnic thrusters {{are affected by the}} time gap. Although two thrusters are simultaneously ignited, the time at which the pressure starts to rise in each thruster may not be synchronized. The characteristic of the system with the time gap is compared with that of the fully synchronized system without any time gap. Depending upon the magnitude of the time gap, the pressure-time profile and the ballistic performance are different. When two pyrotechnic thrusters have a time gap, the peak pressure of one thruster(in which the pressure is built up earlier) is increased and the other is decreased. As the time gap is increased, the peak pressure is converged into the maximum pressure. This maximum pressure can be obtained when only one thruster is activated. Because the maximum pressure is bounded, it is predicted that there isn't any catastrophic failures in the considered system. When the time gap is relatively small, the impulse of the combined force acting on the moving body is <b>almost</b> <b>maintained.</b> But the ballistic performance of the system with a large time gap should be carefully estimate...|$|E
30|$|In {{the dynamic}} {{environment}} of MANETs, trusting the neighbours for secure communication is strenuous to achieve. Traditional cryptographic schemes do not contribute a complete solution {{to detect and}} secure the ad hoc nodes from various attacks. An efficient tool to manage this drawback in MANET is the establishment of trust among nodes. The proposed trust model successfully secures the communication in the clustered network that confirms trust among the participant nodes. Additionally, the trust recommendations and trust computation reduce the chances of attackers in a large amount with mobility adaptive and stable clusters. The theoretical bases for trust computation in this paper also provide a platform for practical implementation in a MANET to provide an efficient public key infrastructure (PKI)-based security framework. Finally, a simple analysis to highlight {{the benefits of the}} proposed strategies was presented. From the analysis, we can observe that in the trust-based certificate management strategy, the increases in revocation time, revocation rate, cost or CRL list is <b>almost</b> <b>maintained</b> at constant, and hence, the system is scalable. In the future, we plan to analyze the performance of the proposed strategies assuming node mobility across geographic clusters, taking into account the overhead incurred in obtaining new certificates, and the corresponding region-specific CRLs.|$|E

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and cytocompatibility of PNIPAAm-g-HA to normal chondrocytes by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and histochemical staining in preliminary in vitro and in vitro experiments. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed homogeneous distribution of cells in the PNIPAAm-g-HA hydrogel in 3 -dimensional in vitro cultivation. Alcian blue staining also indicated that abundant extracellular matrix formation, including acidic glycosaminoglycans, occurred in tissue-engineered cartilage over time in vitro.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the key factors involved in patulin adsorption by heat-inactivated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cells. For preventing bacterial contamination, a sterilization process was involved in the adsorption process. The effects of various physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments, simultaneous treatments, and post-treatments on the patulin adsorption performances of six LAB strains were evaluated. The pre-treated cells were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the removal of patulin by viable cells was mainly based on adsorption or degradation, depending on the specific strain. The adsorption abilities were widely increased by NaOH and esterification pre-treatments, and reduced by trypsin, lipase, iodate, and periodate pre-treatments. Additionally, the adsorption abilities were <b>almost</b> <b>maintained</b> at pH 2. 2 - 4. 0, and enhanced significantly at pH 4. 0 - 6. 0. The effects of sodium and magnesium ions on the adsorption abilities at pH 4 were slight and strain-specific. A lower proportion of patulin was released from the strain with higher adsorption ability. Analyses revealed that the physical structure of peptidoglycan was not a principal factor. Vicinal OH and carboxyl groups were not involved in patulin adsorption, while alkaline amino acids, thiol and ester compounds were important for patulin adsorption. Additionally, besides hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction also participated in patulin adsorption, which was enhanced with the increase in pH (4. 0 - 6. 0) ...|$|E

The proximal tibia metaphyses were processed undecalcified for quantitative bone histomorphometry and the soft tissues were processed in paraffin for pathological observation. RESULTS: Placebo-treated (lactose) Ova rats were characterized by trabecular area (TA) decreasing and their architecture worsening compared with sham controls, and bone resorption was over formation with high bone turnover. The uteri were atrophy. (2) In estrone-treated group, TA and trabecular numbers were significantly increased and the trabecular separation de-creased vs Ova group.
