5|$|In {{the game}} the player {{controls}} Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. Fetus. The gameplay is characterized by fine control and split-second timing as the player runs <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> through over 300hazardous levels while avoiding obstacles. Additional player-created levels are available for free download.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been called both a {{platform}} game and an action-adventure game. GameSpot asserts that it combines elements of ToeJam & Earl and its platformer sequel, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, while GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly liken it to the former game. The game features both single- and two-player modes; in both, players control {{one of the three}} protagonists. ToeJam moves quickly <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> high, but has weak attacks; Earl is tougher and has more powerful attacks, but is slow <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> lower than ToeJam; Latisha ranks between the two in terms of athleticism, and gains additional power-ups later in the game. In the game's two-player mode, the camera moves between single and split-screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other. Characters can share power-ups when in close proximity.|$|E

5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game {{takes the form of a}} series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres <b>and</b> <b>jumps,</b> the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E

When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E

To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to successfully extract the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to return home.|$|E
40|$|Significant jumps {{have been}} found in stock prices and stock indexes, which implied that jump risk is part of {{systematic}} risks. Since jump risk is priced, adding jump risk into the traditional finance models has significant empirical and theoretical meanings. Earlier attempts to model <b>and</b> estimate <b>jumps</b> are based on parametric jump-diffusion models. Due to the limitation of parametric models, the literature is rapidly moving towards using nonparametric methods to study various attributes of jumps in stock prices <b>and</b> the associated <b>jump</b> risks. Two nonparametric methods are employed to extract two different types of jump risks in this thesis. The Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2006) method tests for large <b>and</b> rare <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> can only be used to estimate the total jump risks. Macinni (2009) method allows for both small jumps with infinite activity <b>and</b> large <b>jumps</b> with finite activity. However, the latter method is computationally intensive and is only used to extract the systematic jump risks by applying it only to the market returns. Jump estimations are computed on 1300 individual stocks <b>and</b> 1 index. <b>Jump</b> risks are found in all 1300 stocks and the index <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risk is a small component of the total risk. SmallCap stocks tend to have higher diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks than MidCap and LargeCap stocks. When SmallCap stocks are used to form portfolio, its diversification gain is higher than that of portfolios formed by MidCap or LargeCap stocks. A portfolio's diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks decrease at a diminishing speed as the number of its constituents increase <b>and</b> its <b>jump</b> risk decreases faster than diffusion risk. However, the uncertainty associated with the diversification gain of jump risk is much higher than that of the diffusion risk. To measure the systematic diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks, CAPM is dichotomised into a two-factor model, two independent factors representing the diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> return processes. The diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas for the 1300 stocks are estimated. The diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas for stocks tend to be statistically different from each other...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-documented}} that stock returns have different sensitivities {{to changes in}} aggregate volatility, however less is known about their sensitivity to market jump risk. By using S&P 500 crash-neutral at-the-money straddle and out-of-money put returns as proxies for aggregate volatility <b>and</b> market <b>jump</b> risk, I document significant differences between volatility <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> loadings of value vs. growth, and small vs. big portfolios. In particular, small (big) and value (growth) portfolios exhibit negative (positive) and significant volatility <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas. I also provide further evidence that both volatility <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risk factors are priced and negative...|$|R
5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat. Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E
5|$|LeapFrog Enterprises {{released}} a Sonic X educational math game for its Leapster handheld game console; {{it was released}} in 2005 in North America and 2007 in Europe. The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced platform/action game in which Sonic runs <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, {{each with its own}} math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction). There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.|$|E

Later, {{at a meeting of the}} local chapter of International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians, Carl announces that the newest contract requires the union to give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer for their meeting. Homer slowly comprehends that giving up their dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> into action, reminding everyone how their dental plan has helped them all.|$|E

There are also three sub-commands used by {{pressing}} Shoot and Melee (Sub-Weapon), Shoot <b>and</b> <b>Jump</b> (Special Shooting) <b>and</b> Melee <b>and</b> <b>Jump</b> (Special Melee). In addition to these, machines can have two different charge attacks, activated by holding the Shoot or Melee button until a meter on the ammunition display fills.|$|R
5|$|Players control Conan the Barbarian from a third-person {{perspective}} {{while attempting}} to advance through the series of levels that subdivide the game. The gameplay {{is the same for}} each level: Conan moves from area to area, fighting groups of enemies until he reaches the end. At the end of certain levels, the barbarian has to fight a more powerful opponent called a boss. Defeating a boss involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an interactive button-pressing sequence that players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as knocking down obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of platforming sequences in which Conan climbs walls <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> from ledge to ledge. Players can save their progress by using special stones that are placed throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island is a 1995 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A prequel to the Mario franchise, the game casts players as Yoshi as he escorts Baby Mario through nearly 50 levels in order to reunite him with his brother Luigi, who had been kidnapped by Baby Bowser's minions. Yoshi runs <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> to {{reach the end of}} the level while solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand-drawn aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character. The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump, produce eggs from swallowed enemies, and transform into vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{tracks in}} Super Mario Kart {{are based on}} {{locations}} in Super Mario World such as Donut Plains. Each of the four cups contains five different tracks {{for a total of}} twenty unique tracks, additionally there are four unique Battle Mode courses. The course outlines are marked out by impassable barriers and feature a variety of bends ranging from sharp hairpins to wide curves which players can power slide around. Numerous obstacles themed from the Mario series appear, such as Thwomps in the Bowser's Castle tracks, the Cheep-Cheeps from Super Mario World in Koopa Beach and pipe barriers which are found in the Mario Circuit tracks. Other features include off-road sections which slow down the karts such as the mud bogs in the Choco Island tracks. Each single player track is littered with coins and power up tiles, as well as turbo tiles which give the karts a boost of speed <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> which launch the karts into the air.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E
