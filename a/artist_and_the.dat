5|$|Confessions was commercially successful, selling 1.096 {{million copies}} in the United States in its first week of release. It became the highest-ever first week sales by an R artist, the second-highest first week sales for a male <b>artist,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seventh-highest first week sales of the {{recorded}} album charts history by SoundScan {{at the time of}} its release. It also equates the combined first-week sales of his four previous album releases, including his live album called Live. The feat also carved history in Arista records having the first in any of their released albums to reach such sales. The success of the thirty-year-old record label, however, was attributed to its merging with Zomba Records. As of March 2013 it has the tenth highest first week album sales in history.|$|E
5|$|Doggystyle debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 806,858 {{copies in}} its first week alone in the United States, which was the record for a debuting <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fastest-selling hip-hop album ever. Doggystyle was {{included}} on The Source magazine's list of the 100 Best Rap Albums; as well as Rolling Stone magazine's list of Essential Recordings of the '90s. About.com placed the album in No. 17 of the greatest hip hop/rap albums of all time. The album was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

5|$|Homosexual {{interpretations of}} Batman have {{continued}} into the 21st century. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. In summer 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolours depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both the <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action {{if they did not}} cease selling the works and demanded the surrender of all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.|$|E
5|$|In 1513, Gasparem de Cayrano de Mediolano lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum {{signed the}} {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a new entrance to the Duomo of Chiari. The document, a reconfirmation of an earlier negotiation, shows that the <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> municipality had agreed terms two years earlier, but the plans hadn't been executed because of the war in the Brescia area. The contract provided for the fulfilment of the entire project - from the architectural parts to the figurative sculptures, including a group with the Madonna between the Saints Faustino and Giovita. These are now missing, so it's impossible to assess the evolution of Cairano's art after the completion of the ark of Sant'Appollonio. The rest of the work, moreover, again raise questions about the architectural skills of the artist that are still unanswered.|$|E

In 2012, The MDNA Tour became the second highest-grossing tour among female artists, only behind the Sticky & Sweet Tour, grossing over US $305 million.

5|$|Prior to the series, Jackson {{had thought}} of her singing as merely a private hobby.

Jackson served as a backing vocalist for several musicians around this time, as well as a cabaret singer. She contributed her voice for songs by artists such as The Emotions, Sonny Bono, and Betty Wright before Jackson's second pregnancy stalled her musical career for a short time.|$|E

5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E

At the 1993 annual Premios Eres, Miguel won three awards: Best Album, Best Male Singer and Best Show (for his tour).

In January 2014, a listening party for the album was held at the club XO in Skopje on which Gočeva was also present; the event represented the first of such kind in Macedonia and according to Gočeva, the inspiration for it came from a similar trend popular across the world where the <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> team working behind the album listen to the full final version of the project together with a group of fans and music journalists.|$|E
5|$|The nature <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fantasy {{artist in}} Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects {{share the same}} habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
