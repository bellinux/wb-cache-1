5|$|The {{distinctness}} of the Donegal tradition developed due to {{the close}} relations between Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, {{in addition to the}} standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey). The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players <b>and</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Class distinction, however, became linked as {{the fashion}} of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were {{simultaneously}} considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, <b>and</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen. Marie Antoinette was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.|$|E

5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing {{frustration}} with the process of independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates <b>and</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was {{concluded}} between the British Government <b>and</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an {{oath of allegiance}} to the King was to be taken. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.|$|E

As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not be guaranteed. The ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials <b>and</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the Turkish government.|$|E
