40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the relationship between body composition of preschool children suffering from excess weight and birth weight (BW). Methods: probabilistic sample, by conglomerates, with 17 daycare centers (of a total of 59) composing a final sample of 479 children. We used Z-score of Body Mass Index (zBMI) &# 8805; + 1 and &# 8805; + 2, respectively, to identify preschool children with risk of overweight and excess weight (overweight or obesity). The arm muscle area (AMA) and the arm fat area (AFA) were estimated from measurements of arm circumference, triceps skin fold thickness. Results: the prevalence of risk of overweight was 22. 9 % (n= 110) and excess weight was 9. 3 % (n= 44). The risk of overweight and excess weight in children did not show correlation between BW and AFA, but it did with <b>adjusted</b> <b>arm</b> muscle area (AMAa) (rp= 0. 21; p= 0. 0107). The analysis of the group with excess weight alone also showed {{a positive correlation between}} BW and AMAa (rp= 0. 42; p= 0. 0047). Conclusion: among overweight children, lower BW is associated with a lower arm muscle area in early preschool age, regardless of the fat arm area presented by them...|$|R

40|$|There {{is still}} {{considerable}} debate {{as to whether}} bone mineral content (BMC) increases {{in proportion to the}} projected bone area, A(p), or an estimate of the skeletal bone volume, (A(p)) (3 / 2), being assessed. The results from this study suggest that the bone mass acquisition of elite athletes' arms and legs increases in proportion to the projected bone area, A(p), having simultaneously controlled/removed the effect of the confounding variables of body mass and body fat. Although this supports the use of the traditional bone mineral density ratio (BMD=BMC/A(p)), it also highlights the dangers of overlooking the effect of known confounding variables. Ignoring the effect of such confounding variables, athletic groups whose activities involve upper body strength (rugby, rock climbing, kayaking, weight lifting) had the highest arm BMD, while runners were observed to have the lowest arm BMD (lower than that of the controls). Similarly, leg BMD was highest in rugby players, whose activities included both running and strength training. However, the rugby players were also observed to have the greatest body mass. When the important determinants of body mass, body fat, as well as projected bone area, A(p), were incorporated as covariates into a proportional allometric ANCOVA model for BMC, different conclusions were obtained. The introduction of these covariates had the effect of reducing the sporting differences on <b>adjusted</b> <b>arm</b> BMC, although the "sport" by "side" interaction still identified racket players as the only group with a greater dominant arm BMC (P < 0. 05). In contrast, sporting differences in adjusted leg BMC remained highly significant, but with a rearranged hierarchy. The runners replaced the rugby players as having the greatest adjusted leg BMC. The results confirm the benefits of activity on peripheral bone mass as being site-specific but reinforce the dangers of making generalizations about the relative benefits of different exercises ignoring the effects of known confounding variables, such as body size, body composition, and age...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{conventional}} surgical tool holders requires an assistant during positioning and adjustment {{due to the}} lack of weight compensation. In this paper, we introduce a robotic arm system with hands-on control approach. The robot incorporates a force sensor at the end effector which realises tool weight compensation as well as hands-on manipulation. On the operating table, the required workspace can be tight due to a number of instruments required. There are situations where the surgical tool is at the desired location but the holder arm pose is not ideal due to space constraints or obstacles. Although the arm is a non-redundant robot because of the limited degrees of freedom, the pseudo-null-space inverse kinematics can be used to constrain a particular joint of the robot to a specific angle while the other joints compensate in order to minimise the tool movement. This allows operator to <b>adjust</b> the <b>arm</b> configuration conveniently together with the weight compensation. Experimental results demonstrated that our robotic arm can maintain the tool position during reconfiguration significantly more stably than a conventional one...|$|R

She recovered her old form in mid-June, determined to <b>adjust</b> her <b>arm</b> angle on her pitching deliveries. This change to overhand pitching did not mean that a pitcher could not drop down in her delivery. Occasionally, Faut threw a pitch below sidearm to keep opposing hitters off balance with an array of five quality pitches. She still produced a fine season, fashioning a 16–11 record with 165 strikeouts and a 1.44 ERA in 34 games, hurling 250 innings, ranking seventh among pitchers with at least 45 or more innings, ending seventh in ERA and eighth in strikeouts. The smaller ball and overhand delivery made her curveball pitch more effective. That season, Grand Rapids' Alice Haylett went 25–5 with a league-best 0.77 ERA, while Racine's Joanne Winter finished 25–12 and led in strikeouts (248). On September 4, Faut pitched her first no-hitter, beating the host Racine Belles, 7–0. Her teammate Lillian Faralla had thrown a no-hitter against Racine on May 11, so two Blue Sox pitchers defeated the Belles with two no-hitters in the same season.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the human ability {{to adapt to a}} perturbation in a synchronization task. Five experimental signal conditions were tested using random-dot kinematograms, representing four conditions with different coherence levels (100 %, 50 %, 30 % and 10 %) and one target-alone condition. Within one trial, increasing or decreasing the frequency of the sinusoidally moving signal dots abruptly in the midst of each trial provoked a perturbation. The first experiment was aimed to clarify the process of adaptation to the new frequency situation. The second experiment explored the role of visual feedback about the arm's position on the participants' ability to adapt after the perturbation had occurred. The results clearly demonstrated that the synchronization performance gradually declined in function of the increasing number of randomly moving noise dots. In the 50 % coherence condition, the participants were not or only partially able to <b>adjust</b> their <b>arm</b> movements to the new frequency situation. In addition, the provision of enhanced visual feedback about the arm's failed to improve one's adaptive ability.

There is a growing body of information available on the internet which is aimed at the training individuals in offensive knife attacks. This poster aims to raise awareness of this issue and highlight how a trained individual modifies an attack sequence depending on their victim’s posture and the protective clothing worn.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of different lesion sets of ablation in patients undergoing mitral surgery plus maze. Background: The role of lesion sets on outcome after maze is poorly defined. Methods: A total of 141 patients were prospectively followed up. Two different lesion sets were prepared: 32 patients underwent a radiofrequency left atrial lesion set of maze ("limited"), and 109 had combined left and right atrial lesion sets of maze ± ganglionic plexi isolation ("extensive").
