5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} {{his refusal to}} reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan.

5|$|Mitchell {{turned himself}} in to {{authorities}} on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges.

In May 2012, Mitchell {{filed a lawsuit against}} a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he suffers from headaches, insomnia, and memory loss.

His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to community service and probation. On October 29, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison.
