5|$|Sicilian Baroque {{is today}} {{recognised}} as an architectural style, {{largely due to}} the work of Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 was the first book to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 {{is rated}} well by car critics, who <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> car's {{interior}} and exterior design. In spite of comments regarding the DB9's weaker engine and handling, reviewers liked the car's ride and driving experience. Some also held issue with the DB9's small rear seats, cargo space and poor satnav.|$|E

They <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> plum-duff and the greasy cakes highly, and they more than <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> tea--especially the women--which MacSweenie took care to provide hot, strong, and sweet. But {{there is no doubt that}} the lion of the evening was--the [...] "fuddle." ...|$|R
50|$|The U350 was {{released}} in July 2009 to mixed reviews from different publications. LAPTOP Magazine <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> laptop’s design and low starting price, but was disappointed by the low battery life. Computer Shopper discounted the laptop’s performance but <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> light weight and affordable price. Stark Insider <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> laptop’s price, performance, keyboard, display and speakers. The negative points noted were the fan noise and heat on the left palm rest.|$|R
50|$|Japanese {{video game}} {{magazine}} Famitsu gave the game {{a score of}} 27/40 in a cross review by four reviewers.

5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to}} which it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower gave Nixon {{responsibilities}} {{during his}} term as vice president—more {{than any previous}} vice president. Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent. A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> potential of the region as an industrial center. He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina. On {{his return to the}} United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.|$|E
5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI researchers had failed to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E

While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> idea of doing things in a simpler way. So {{without a lot of}} fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was {{particularly}} vocal about increased African {{representation in the}} Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the federation was never a goal of its proponents, it was there primarily {{because it was not}} economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{critically}} acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned {{that not all}} players would <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> level of difficulty. The game was a commercial success, and sold {{more than one million}} copies as of January 2012. A sequel, Super Meat Boy Forever, is currently in development for release in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E

5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Holloman again {{spent the}} season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an {{invitation}} to spring training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, {{for this reason that}} Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year. In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of {{the season with}} the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11–9 record and a 3.87 ERA.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} war strategy, Lincoln {{articulated}} two priorities: {{to ensure that}} Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force {{him to take a}} carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.|$|E
5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it still did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> problems of the Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, creative ideas that are continually received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E
