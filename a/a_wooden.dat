5|$|After leaving school, Macartney {{worked for}} a fruit and {{vegetable}} merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> wharf during his lunch break. At this stage in his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, something he was to discard for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.|$|E
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945.

5|$|Another small-bore cannon of the 14th {{century was}} the culverin, whose name derives from the snake-like handles {{attached}} to it.
