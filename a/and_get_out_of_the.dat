25|$|On January 12, 1946, Reeves {{was denied}} {{a request by}} the other NFL owners to move the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles and the then-103,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He {{threatened}} to end {{his relationship with the}} NFL <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional football business altogether unless the transfer to Los Angeles was permitted. A settlement was reached and, as a result, Reeves was allowed to move his team to Los Angeles. Consequently, the NFL became the first professional coast-to-coast sports entertainment industry.|$|E
500|$|As of 2013, Dylan {{was working}} as a host at a New York City restaurant, which he {{explained}} was a result of his desire to try a new experience, as he said, [...] "working somewhat below the means I'm used to, as well as a way to socialize <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house." ...|$|E

500|$|To avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took {{a low-key}} {{approach}} to promoting In Utero; the company's {{head of marketing}} told Billboard before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy {{similar to that of}} Nevermind, and explained that the label would [...] "set things up, duck, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way". [...] The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. [...] In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Uteros singles commercially in the United States. [...] DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, [...] "Heart-Shaped Box", to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. [...] Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as successful as Nevermind. [...] Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, [...] "We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon Kelly's death, former {{teammate}} Tom Brown said, [...] "He originated the slide which I do now in base running, {{and which is}} very generally copied by many ball players. The scheme is to slide to the side <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way of the baseman, and not dash into him in the old way. Owing {{to the success of}} Kelly's sliding the topical song [...] was written." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding a {{forthcoming}} fifth studio album, Hutchison noted in October 2013: [...] "We're {{going to have}} to start thinking about the next record after this tour. We've done a lot of writing in Scotland, but it would be good to shift it up a gear <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comfort zone, away from what we're used to, and over [...] would be good for that. So the only worry, especially on the West Coast and California, is the effect that may have on my writing, and whether I would be all happy and full of vitamins." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1986 {{was also}} the year that the racing variant, the Porsche 961, made its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driven by René Metge partnering Claude Ballot-Léna, it {{finished}} first in its class and 7th overall. It returned in 1987 but failed to finish after a spin (missed gear change) while in 11th place by Canadian/Dutch driver Kees Nierop of Vancouver. Upon rejoining the track the car was observed on TV monitors in the Porsche pits to be on fire and the driver was told to stop <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. Sadly Nierop pulled over between marshal stations and this extra time taken {{to get to the}} car by the marshals allowed the fire to consume most of the rear end and destroy the car. Thus ended the career of the 961. It was later repaired and put on display at the Porsche Museum.|$|E
2500|$|In World War I, shell shock was {{considered}} a psychiatric illness resulting from injury to the nerves during combat. The horrors of trench warfare meant that about 10% of the fighting soldiers were killed (compared to 4.5% during World War II) and the total proportion of troops who became casualties (killed or wounded) was 56%. Whether a shell-shock sufferer {{was considered}} [...] "wounded" [...] or [...] "sick" [...] depended on the circumstances. [...] When faced with the phenomenon of a minority of soldiers mentally breaking down, there was an expectation that the root of this problem lay in character of the individual soldier, not {{because of what they}} experienced on the front lines during the war. These sorts of attitudes helped fuel the main argument that was accepted after the war and going forward that there was a social root to shell shock that consisted of soldiers finding the only way allowed by the military to show weakness <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front, claiming that their mental anguish constituted a legitimate medical diagnosis as a disease. [...] The large proportion of World War I veterans in the European population meant that the symptoms were common to the culture.|$|E
