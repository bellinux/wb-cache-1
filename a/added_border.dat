40|$|Excerpt] The {{terrorist}} attacks of 2001 focused attention on the U. S. -Canadian border. Several bilateral initiatives have been undertaken to minimize disruption to commerce from <b>added</b> <b>border</b> security. The focus on the border has renewed interest in some quarters in greater economic integration, either through incremental measures such as greater regulatory cooperation or potentially larger goals such as a customs or monetary union. Congressional interest has focused mostly on trade disputes, and also {{on the ability of}} the two nations to continue their traditional volume of trade with heightened security on the border...|$|E
40|$|In {{reduced speed}} zones, where no other cues {{indicate}} {{the need to}} slow down, drivers sometimes fail to notice the standard Speed Limit sign and may be speeding inadvertently. To help reduce inadvertent speeding, a red border was installed around the Speed Limit sign in seven reduced speed areas and the impacts of the increased conspicuity on speed limit compliance were measured. The general study approach was to collect and compare speed data for a standard sign (before condition) and a red border sign (after condition). The short-term effects of a modified red border sign, which was achieved by replacing the thin black border of the standard sign with a four inch wide red border, were evaluated at four sites. Results of this modified border study {{indicated that there was}} a statistically significant reduction in the mean speeds {{as well as in the}} 85 th percentile speeds for the red border sign conditions, however the reductions were not practically significant. This study also evaluated the effect of using a higher conspicuity sheeting material at two sites. The results indicated that use of higher conspicuity sheeting has some benefits for the standard sign but no additional benefits for the red border sign. The <b>added</b> <b>border</b> study evaluated the long-term effects (approximately nine to eleven months after the treatment) of adding a three inch wide red border to the standard Speed Limit sign at three sites. The results of this study indicated that impacts of the red border treatment increase with passage of time. The mean speeds decreased by 8. 1 percent and the percent of vehicles exceeding the speed limit (55 mph) decreased by 21. 7 percent. The decreases in speeds were both statistically and practically significant. A comparison of the thesis study with other similar studies found in literature shows comparable benefits of the red border sign with other speed management measures. Based on the results for long-term effects, use of the red border Speed Limit sign is recommended in reduced speed zones where inadvertent speeding is common...|$|E

The frontispiece port. of Petrarch in bk. [6] appeared previously in Marcolini's 1539 Il Petrarca; see Mortimer 165. Marcolini's device of Truth as {{the daughter of}} Time appears additionally as a text ill. on p. 39 of bk. [2], with <b>added</b> <b>border</b> and background. Illustrations: 58 text ill., most of them allegorical, in addition to title borders, the devices of Doni and Marcolini, and historiated initials (the last chiefly in bk. [5]). A number of the small ill. (ca. 78 mm. square within double-line borders) were designed for Marcolini's Sorti of 1540; see Mortimer, 164. The architectural title border that appears {{at the beginning of the}} vol. as a whole and at the beginning of books [2 - 6] incorporates figures and 2 gourds. Prepared for this ed., it was also used for the Spanish translation published by Marcolini later in 1551. Stylistically the border derives from Lorenzo Torrentino's Medici border apparently first used at Florence in 1550; see Mortimer, 164. Two less elaborate borders of scrolls and vines are used on the added t. p. 's of pts. 1 - 3 of books [3 - 6] (except pt. 1, bk. [6]).

50|$|Now, assume {{one also}} desires {{the ability to}} <b>add</b> <b>borders</b> to windows. Again, the {{original}} Window class has no support. The ScrollingWindow subclass now poses a problem, because it has effectively created {{a new kind of}} window. If one wishes to <b>add</b> <b>border</b> support to many but not all windows, one must create subclasses WindowWithBorder and ScrollingWindowWithBorder etc. This problem gets worse with every new feature or window subtype to be added. For the decorator solution, we simply create a new BorderedWindowDecorator—at runtime, we can decorate existing windows with the ScrollingWindowDecorator or the BorderedWindowDecorator or both, as we see fit. Notice that if the functionality needs to be added to all Windows, you could modify the base class and that will do. On the other hand, sometimes (e.g., using external frameworks) it is not possible, legal, or convenient to modify the base class.|$|R

Another common theme amongst artisans during this time period was also to rewrite already-printed texts back into manuscript.|$|R
