5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Coulthard's {{second place}} narrowed the gap to Michael Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship to six points, while Häkkinen's win meant he closed to within two points of Coulthard.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Schumacher reduced Häkkinen's {{lead in the}} Drivers' Championship to two points, with David Coulthard {{a further}} 17 points back. Rubens Barrichello who {{was caught up in}} the first lap {{accident}} was mathematically ruled out of clinching the title. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's eight-point advantage going into the race was reduced to four, with three races of the season remaining. Gislimberti later died in hospital and his death caused safety measures in Formula One to be reviewed.|$|E
5|$|Following an 1866 {{conflict}} between the increasingly authoritarian Cuza and the political class, various trends organized a coup which brought Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern, to the Romanian throne—echoing a will expressed {{by some of the}} 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state.

5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geometry of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth vow of Aparigraha). The disputes triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E
