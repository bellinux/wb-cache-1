25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{thematic}} framework hearkens back to Poe, James, {{and early}} gothic fiction, {{as well as}} films such as Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and The Night of the Hunter (1955) and the entire notion of film noir. Lynch has called it a [...] "film <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> hidden—within a small city and within people." [...] Like many other Lynch films, Blue Velvet is immersed in pop culture imagery, both from the 1950s and the 1960s, {{as well as the}} 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn. Based on a metal carving in the 16th century, these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes. It features a skeleton on a throne that is standing {{on top of the}} world, and the words [...] "The mirror which flatters not." [...] Flynn thought [...] "this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves.

500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to talk about these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E

At the time, guitarist Josh Partington said: [...] " [...] can't worry <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> out of your control ... I can't {{do anything about it}} so you just keep doing what you're doing." [...] On July 12, 2003, North was announced for release. From mid-July to late August, the band supported 311 on their tour of the US. [...] "Space" [...] was released as a single on September 8, and released to modern rock radio a day later. A music video for the song was premiered by Fox Broadcasting Company on September 16. The video was filmed in August during the band's tour with 311 by director Mike Piscitelli. It featured five pillars, all of them fitted with video monitors, placed in various locations within Los Angeles, such as in an alleyway or at a bus stop. In September, the band supported Good Charlotte on their arena tour of the US.|$|E

The film explores issues on Paedophilia, depicting a young boy, Koya being molested by a western religious leader, Father Dowling, a supposed custodian of societal moral standards; This makes disappointed and angry Koya to hold the belief that [...] "western education is evil", a slogan associated with the present day Boko Haram. Tunde Babalola, the scriptwriter commented: [...] "As a writer, I want to delve into subjects that people don’t want to talk about. I don’t want to write things {{that people want to}} say. I would rather write <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> controversial, and that which will get people talking for weeks". Victor Akande of The Nation comments: [...] "October 1 captures the approach used by two young men who are vexed by a system (Western education) they expect will make them better humans, but which ends up corrupting their traditional upbringing; worse still, by men of same sex".|$|E

This hope will bring that man that has it, and exercises it, to heaven, when leviathan is pulled out of the sea with a hook; or when his jaw is bored through with a thorn: but as he that thinks to do this, hopeth in vain; so, even so, will the hope of the other be as unsuccessful; 'So are the paths of all that forget God, and the hypocrite's hope shall perish; whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure' (Job 8:13-15, 41:1-9). This is the hope that is not esteemed of God, nor the persons that have it, preferred by him a whit before their own dung (Job 20:4-8).|$|E

He pictured a battered wooden vessel, stripped to her topsails and staysails and kept afloat by the windmill pump, beating round Cape Horn while her exhausted crew got mutinous, and food got short.

At night he lights up a good cigar, and climbs into the little old 'bus, and maybe cusses the carburetor, and shoots out home. He mows the lawn, or sneaks in some practice putting, and then he's ready for dinner. After dinner he tells the kiddies a story, or takes the family to the movies, or plays a few fists of bridge, or reads the evening paper, and a chapter or two of some good lively Western novel if he has a taste for literature, and maybe the folks next-door drop in and they sit and visit about their friends and the topics of the day. Then he goes happily to bed, his conscience clear, having contributed his mite to the prosperity of the city and to his own bank-account.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Scogan paid no {{attention}} to his denial, but went on: [...] "Why will you young men continue to write <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> so entirely uninteresting as the mentality of adolescents and artists? Professional anthropologists might find it interesting to turn sometimes from the beliefs of the Blackfellow to the philosophical preoccupations of the undergraduate. But you can't expect an ordinary adult man, like myself, to be much moved by the story of his spiritual troubles. And after all, even in England, even in Germany and Russia, there are more adults than adolescents. As for the artist, he is preoccupied with problems that are so utterly unlike those of the ordinary adult man--problems of pure aesthetics which don't so much as present themselves to people like myself--that a description of his mental processes is as boring to the ordinary reader as a piece of pure mathematics. A serious book about artists regarded as artists is unreadable; and a book about artists regarded as lovers, husbands, dipsomaniacs, heroes, and the like is really not worth writing again. Jean-Christophe is the stock artist of literature, just as Professor Radium of 'Comic Cuts' is its stock man of science." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3. As he that cometh to God by Christ is no fool, {{so he is}} no little-spirited fellow. There are a {{generation}} of men {{in this world that}} count themselves men of the largest capacities, when yet the greatness of their desires lift themselves no higher than to things below. If they can, with their net of craft and policy, encompass a bulky lump of earth, oh what a treasure have they engrossed to themselves! Meanwhile, the man in the text has laid siege to heaven, has found out the way to get into the city, and is resolved, in and by God's help, to make that his own. Earth is a drossy thing in this man's account; earthly greatness and splendours are but like vanishing bubbles in this man's esteem. None but God, as the end of his desires, none but Christ, as the means to accomplish this his end, are things counted great by this man. No company now is acceptable to this man but the Spirit of God, Christ and angels, and saints, as fellow-heirs with himself. All other men and things he deals with as strangers and pilgrims were wont to do. This man's mind soars higher than the eagle or stork of the heavens. He is for musing <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> above, and their glory, and for thinking what shall come to pass hereafter.|$|E

60|$|II. In {{the midst}} of your zeal for the Lord, {{remember}} that the visible saint is his; and is privileged in all those spiritual {{things that you have}} in the word and live in the practice of, and that he is to partake thereof, according to his light therein. Quarrel not with him <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> circumstantial; but receive him in the Lord, as becometh saints: if he will not have communion with you, the neglect is his, not yours. But saith the open profane, why cannot we be reckoned saints also? We have been christened, we go to church, we take the communion.[20] Poor people! This will not do; for so long as in life and conversation you appear to be open profane, we cannot, unless we sin, receive you into our fellowship: for by your ungodly lives you shew that you know not Christ; and while you are such by the word, you are reputed but beasts: now then judge yourselves, if it be not a strange community that consisteth of men and beasts: let beasts be with the beasts, you know yourselves do so; you receive not your horse nor your hog to your table, you put them in a room by themselves. Besides I have shewed you before, that for many reasons we cannot have communion with you.|$|E
6000|$|I cannot claim {{any special}} {{property}} in this theory {{of what the}} medical curriculum should be, for I find that views, more or less closely approximating these, are held by all who have seriously considered the very grave and pressing question of Medical Reform; and have, indeed, been carried into practice, to some extent, by the most enlightened Examining Boards. I have heard but two kinds of objections to them. There is first, the objection of vested interests, which I will not deal with here, because I want to make myself as pleasant as I can, and no discussions are so unpleasant as those which turn on such points. And there is, secondly, the much more respectable objection, which takes the general form of the reproach that, in thus limiting the curriculum, we are seeking to narrow it. We are told that the medical man {{ought to be a}} person of good education and general information, if his profession is to hold its own among other professions; that he ought to know Botany, or else, if he goes abroad, he {{will not be able to}} tell poisonous fruits from edible ones; that he ought to know drugs, as a druggist knows them, or he will not be able to tell sham bark and senna from the real articles; that he ought to know Zoology, because--well, I really have never been able to learn exactly why he is to be expected to know zoology. There is, indeed, a popular superstition, that doctors know all <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> queer or nasty to the general mind, and may, therefore, be reasonably expected to know the [...] "barbarous binomials" [...] applicable to snakes, snails, and slugs; an amount of information with which the general mind is usually completely satisfied. And there is a scientific superstition that Physiology is largely aided by Comparative Anatomy--a superstition which, like most superstitions, once had a grain of truth at bottom; but the grain has become homoeopathic, since Physiology took its modern experimental development, and became what it is now, the application of the principles of Physics and Chemistry to the elucidation of the phaenomena of life.|$|E

False statements took longer to process than positive statements (deciding <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not in the plan), but also surprisingly had lower error rates than positive statements.
