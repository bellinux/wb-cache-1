40|$|STUDY QUESTION: What are the {{pregnancy}} outcomes {{for women with}} <b>a</b> twin <b>pregnancy</b> that is reduced to <b>a</b> singleton <b>pregnancy?</b> summary answer: Fetal reduction of <b>a</b> twin <b>pregnancy</b> significantly improves gestational age at birth and neonatal birthweight, however at {{an increased risk of}} pregnancy loss and preterm delivery. what is known already: Women with <b>a</b> multiple <b>pregnancy</b> are at increased risk for preterm delivery. Fetal reduction can be considered in these women. study design, size, and duration: Retrospective cohort study of 118 women with <b>a</b> twin <b>pregnancy</b> reduced to <b>a</b> singleton <b>pregnancy</b> between 2000 and 2010. participants/materials, setting, and methods: We compared the outcome of pregnancy in consecutive women with <b>a</b> dichorionic twin <b>pregnancy</b> that was reduced to <b>a</b> singleton <b>pregnancy</b> to that of women with <b>a</b> dichorionic twin <b>pregnancy</b> that was managed expectantly and women with <b>a</b> primary singleton <b>pregnancy.</b> Reductions were performed between 10 - 23 (6 / 7) weeks' gestation by intracardiac or intrathoracic injection of potassium chloride, mostly for congenital anomalies.

40|$|Abstract:Women who {{present with}} pain and {{bleeding}} in the first trimester {{are at risk for}} ectopic <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>a</b> life-threatening condition. Conditions that predispose a woman to ectopic pregnancy are damaged fallopian tubes from prior tubal surgery or previous pelvic infection, smoking, and conception using assisted reproduction. Many women without risk factors can develop <b>an</b> ectopic <b>pregnancy.</b> <b>A</b> diagnostic algorithm that includes the use of transvaginal ultrasonography, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations, and, sometimes, uterine curettage can definitively diagnose women at risk in a timely manner. The absence of <b>an</b> intrauterine <b>pregnancy</b> above <b>an</b> established cut point of hCG is consistent with <b>an</b> abnormal <b>pregnancy</b> but does not distinguish a miscarriage from <b>an</b> ectopic <b>pregnancy.</b> When the initial hCG value is low, serial hCG values can be used to determine whether a gestation is potentially viable or spontaneously resolving. The minimal rise in hCG for <b>a</b> viable <b>pregnancy</b> is 53 % in 2 days. The minimal decline of a spontaneous abortion is 21 – 35 % in 2 days, depending on the initial level. A rise or fall in serial hCG values that is slower than this is suggestive of <b>an</b> ectopic <b>pregnancy.</b> Women diagnosed with <b>an</b> unruptured ectopic <b>pregnancy</b> are potential candidates for medical management with methotrexate.

5|$|January Jones became {{pregnant}} {{in between the}} fourth and fifth season of the series. Instead of writing in <b>a</b> <b>pregnancy</b> for the Betty Francis character, the writers opted to write in a weight gain. January Jones wore a fat suit during the filming of this episode, the same technique used by Elizabeth Moss during the first season when her character encountered a similar weight gain (though in that instance, the character was actually pregnant). Make-up tricks and clever camera angles were also used to create the dramatic impression of Betty's weight gain. A body double was used for the scene in which Betty rises from the bathtub.|$|E

5|$|Maternal age {{affects the}} chances of having <b>a</b> <b>pregnancy</b> with Down syndrome. At age 20, the chance is one in 1441; at age 30, it is one in 959; at age 40, it is one in 84; and at age 50 it is one in 44. Although the {{probability}} increases with maternal age, 70% of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children. The father's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35, but not in women younger than 35, and may partly explain the increase in risk as women age.|$|E

5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult.

However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E

30|$|Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} {{is defined as}} the coexistence of an intrauterine and <b>an</b> ectopic <b>pregnancy.</b> The estimated incidence is one in 30, 000 spontaneous <b>pregnancies,</b> with <b>a</b> tenfold increase in women who underwent assisted reproductive technologies. Diagnosis of <b>a</b> heterotopic <b>pregnancy</b> is often delayed {{because of the presence of}} the intrauterine gestational sac. Treatment of <b>a</b> heterotopic <b>pregnancy</b> should consist of termination of the ectopic pregnancy without damaging the ongoing intrauterine pregnancy. The least invasive procedure should therefore be used. We present a case of <b>a</b> heterotopic <b>pregnancy</b> consisting of <b>a</b> viable intrauterine <b>pregnancy</b> and <b>an</b> ectopic cornual <b>pregnancy.</b> Because of the viable intrauterine pregnancy, we decided to treat the cornual pregnancy laparoscopically by the endoloop technique. This technique is simple, safe, effective and nearly bloodless. It offers a good prognosis for the ongoing intrauterine pregnancy.|$|R
