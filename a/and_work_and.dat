5|$|Einstein was {{now without}} a {{permanent}} home, unsure {{where he would}} live <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> equally worried {{about the fate of}} countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E
5|$|To thank Caymmi for {{bringing}} international attention to Brazilian music and culture, in 1968, {{the governor of}} Bahia presented Caymmi with a house in Salvador, and so he returned to live in his hometown {{for a short period}} of time. In 1972, Caymmi was awarded the Order of Merit of the State of Bahia, an order given to Bahian residents for excellent service to the state. In Caymmi's case, the service was bringing pride and honor to Bahian people through the widespread dissemination of his music about life there. On Caymmi's 70th birthday, in 1984, French Minister of Culture Jack Lang presented him with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, a French order that recognizes significant contributors to the fields of art and literature, in Paris. The following year, a new street named Avenida Dorival Caymmi (Dorival Caymmi Avenue) opened in Salvador. In 1986, Rio de Janeiro's famed Mangueira samba school based its Carnaval performance on Caymmi's life <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> the school won the annual parade-style samba competition. In 2015, his tribute album Centenário Caymmi was nominated for the 16th Latin Grammy Awards in the Best MPB Album category.|$|E

25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} such as Michael Licona or Ray Van Neste who ascribe {{the books}} to Paul find their placement fits within his life <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> see the linguistic differences as complementary to differences in the recipients.

25|$|The {{single best}} source on Jane Frank is The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank (1968), by Phoebe B. Stanton (the art history {{professor}} emerita at Johns Hopkins University {{who died in}} 2003). Stanton's text provides a guide to Jane Frank's life <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> there is a helpful and liberal use of quotations from the artist herself, enabling the reader to understand how Frank's thinking evolved, especially from the late 1950s through the late 1960s. The book (out of print but still in many public and university art libraries) also contains a wealth of biographical information and many large plate reproductions of the artist's works, some in color. There are also photographs of the artist.|$|E
25|$|In what {{is arguably}} her most {{influential}} work, The Human Condition (1958), Arendt differentiates {{political and social}} concepts, labor <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding {{to the existence of}} a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social part of human nature, political life, has been intentionally realized in only a few societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom. Conceptual categories, which attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} ontological and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as that which is both existential and aesthetic.|$|E
