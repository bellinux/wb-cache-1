5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the characters were inspired by her past.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target, in the blind spot of the observer, and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Counseling at the Crossroads: The {{perspectives}} and promise {{of school counselors}} in American education, the largest survey {{of high school and}} middle school counselors in the United States (over 5,300 interviews), was released by the College Board's National Office for School Counselor Advocacy, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American School Counselor Association. The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

500|$|Ferris Jabr of New Scientist {{approved}} of Contagion for accurately portraying the [...] "successes and frustrations" [...] of science. Jabr cites story {{elements such as}} [...] "the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they {{need to figure out}} how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells" [...] as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, [...] "It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them die." [...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk." [...] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that [...] "typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here." [...] Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not certain}} on what day the Russians began {{shelling}} the fort. Based on reports by Apraksin to Peter and on Peter the Great's journal, Russian artillery opened fire on 1 April. However, Apraksin reported to the czar that he [...] "began bombarding Viborg and the castle on 30 March, and {{on the first day}} 130 bombs were planted, and 90 on the second." [...] Furthermore, Aleksander Myshlayevsky published a [...] "List of how many shots were fired from mortars and cannon at Viborg from 21 March to 9 April, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them hit the city." [...] There, it claims that shelling began on 29 March, when 150 mortar shots and 60 cannon shots were fired. It continues, saying that during the next three days only the mortars were used, firing 100 shots per day. In total, during the first period of the siege, the attackers fired 2,975 shots from mortars and 1,531 from cannon, and the Swedes fired 399 mortar shots and 7,464 cannon shots; thus the Swedish fire outweighed the Russian fire. On 5 April, Apraksin noted that [...] "our cannon are doing little to help us, for they are rather small and light; when we begin firing, the opponent shoots one out of ten." [...] However, the mortars inflicted great damage upon Vyborg and the fort, forcing citizens to find cover in cellars. Despite this, soldiers had to remain positioned on the mounds, and suffered heavy casualties.|$|E

This depends, as so many other Zoroastrian beliefs and {{practices}} do, on whether you are a [...] "reformist" [...] or a [...] "traditionalist." [...] The reformists, following the Gathas as their prime guide, judge the Vendidad harshly as being a deviation from the non-prescriptive, abstract teachings of the Gathas. For them, few if any of the laws or practices in the Vendidad are either in the spirit or the letter of the Gathas, and so they are not to be followed. The reformists prefer to regard the Vendidad as a document which has no religious value but is only of historic or anthropological interest. Many Zoroastrians, in Iran, India, and the world diaspora, inspired by reformists, have chosen to dispense with the Vendidad prescriptions entirely or only to follow those which they believe are not against the original spirit of the Gathas." ...|$|E
