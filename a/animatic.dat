5|$|A {{number of}} scenes that {{appeared}} in the storyboard and <b>animatic</b> were reordered or dropped altogether in {{the final version of the}} episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A scene in which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.|$|E
5|$|When {{attending}} a Fox Broadcasting Company publicity event in New York City with Rupert Murdoch, show producer Matt Groening {{was introduced by}} Murdoch to Rickles. Rickles began shouting at Groening, accusing him of spying on his Las Vegas act and using material from that for the episode. The cast actually had been receiving recordings from Rickles from the 1950s to use as {{ideas on how to}} get the style for his <b>animatic</b> portrayal. Another side story the writers produced was for Homer to become an outstanding barber and hair dresser, but this was never used.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{movie to}} Ever 17 {{was created by}} the game's producer, who picked out CGs and {{keywords}} from the game to include. Nakazawa gave instructions to have the characters appear in the same order as the recommended route playing order the developers had decided on, hoping for the order to leave an impression and influence players to play the game in that order. The ending movie was created by Nakazawa, who was not used to the tools used in video creation. He added a timeline to the credits roll, intending for it to feel emotional to get an overview of the story after having finished it, and finding it fitting to have a timeline scrolling along with the calm ending theme. For the PlayStation Portable version, {{the creation of a new}} opening movie was outsourced to a video design company, chosen specifically for one designer working there. Nakazawa sent them instructions on what text and graphics to use, and they created an <b>animatic</b> based on it, before adding the details. The ending movie for this version {{was created by the}} publisher, Cyberfront, without Nakazawa's involvement.|$|E

500|$|Almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators and compositors {{created the}} multi-layered 2D and 3D {{backgrounds}} for the live-action footage while the entire movie was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then re-created as CG <b>animatics.</b> Ten months before Conran made it, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created it in <b>animatics</b> so the actors could envision it.|$|R

25|$|Rough Draft Studios {{animated}} Futurama. The studio {{would receive}} the completed script of an episode {{and create a}} storyboard consisting over 100 drawings. It would then produce a pencil-drawn <b>animatic</b> with 1000 frames. Rough Draft's sister studio in South Korea would render the 30,000-frame finished episode.|$|E
25|$|Regular Show has no regular theme music; instead at the {{beginning}} of each episode, a blurred sound (provided by Quintel) followed by a ticking a clock is heard over the title cards. The main composer of the series is Mark Mothersbaugh, one of the founding members of the band Devo. As Quintel was developing the pilot he considered asking Mothersbaugh to create the music for the show. The episode's <b>animatic</b> was sent to Mothersbaugh along with a request for him to join the show's staff and crew.|$|E
25|$|From {{writing to}} animation, the episode took {{three months to}} produce. After the script was {{finished}} and approved, the animators storyboarded each scene and the dialogue was recorded before the two were merged into the <b>animatic.</b> As with the other episodes, stop-motion animation of custom-made action figures was used to produce the episode. Each animator produced 12 seconds of footage a day and the team, which Green directed, was finished in two weeks. Editing, visual and sound effects then took a further two months. Lucasfilm supplied them with the sound effects from the films. A sketch parodying the Han shot first controversy (which saw Han Solo and Greedo repeatedly attempt to shoot each other, but continually miss) was cut from the episode.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>animatics</b> {{and other}} {{supplemental}} material were released as extras with ADV Films' Robotech DVD release.|$|R

5000|$|The creators marketed {{the series}} for {{children}} ages six through eleven. Sunbow contracted with <b>Animatics,</b> an Orlando, Florida-based company, allowing for <b>Animatics</b> to create the storyline and the storyboard for the series. Laura Sullivan, the senior director of marketing of Sony Wonder, said in a 1999 Promo article that the series attracted equal numbers {{of male and female}} children and that it was [...] "very Nickelodeon-looking." ...|$|R
25|$|Each {{episode of}} Regular Show takes {{about nine months}} to complete. Quintel and his 35-member team develop each episode at Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank, California. The script is {{illustrated}} in rough hand-drawn images, known as storyboards. The storyboards are then animated and mixed with the corresponding dialogue to create the <b>animatic,</b> which is then sent {{to be approved by}} the network. The show's assets (backgrounds, character designs, props) are then assembled to be sent to Saerom Animation in South Korea, where the actual animation production of the episode is performed. When finished, the episode is sent to Sabre Media Studios back in California. Music and sound effects are created and the final episode is mixed and completed. The process allows the production team to work concurrently on dozens of episodes at different stages of production.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "pencil test [...] {{imported}} into the computer" [...] {{referred to by}} Lawrence was an <b>animatic.</b> This process was implemented by a specialized graphics IT group within the Turner organization called the Production Technology Group (PTG).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. When Dietter read through his first script, she did not find it very funny {{because of all the}} visual gags. Once the <b>animatic</b> was finished, her opinion changed, and she thought to herself: [...] "Hey, this is really funny!".|$|E
5|$|The entire {{movie was}} sketched out via {{hand-drawn}} storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D <b>animatics</b> {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the <b>animatics</b> as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|R
50|$|The deleted {{scenes are}} only <b>animatics</b> {{as they were}} either {{incomplete}} {{in time for the}} film or replaced with a different scene.|$|R
25|$|The {{unfinished}} <b>animatics</b> for Bad Batch, a four-episode arc, {{were screened}} at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California on April 17, 2015.|$|R
500|$|The episode's ending was unusual, as many {{episodes of}} South Park tend {{to resolve the}} episode's events; in [...] "Fatbeard", the main {{characters}} don't return home and are shown at the end still in Somalia. An alternate ending {{made it to the}} <b>animatic</b> stage, in which Cartman, in a self-referential manner, congratulates the show on the conclusion of the season and invites the season's celebrity parodies (among those the Jonas Brothers and Kanye West). The ending, which Parker likened to that of a variety show, was something he felt was funny in writing but didn't succeed visually.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} later {{released}} on the DVD {{of the same}} name on April 17, 2007. The DVD featured six other episodes, including [...] "The Original Fry Cook", [...] "Night Light", [...] "Rise and Shine", [...] "Waiting", [...] "Fungus Among Us" [...] and [...] "Spy Buddies", and the original uncut <b>animatic</b> for [...] "Friend or Foe" [...] and special Plankton and Mr. Krabs photo gallery as bonus features. It was also released on the [...] DVD on September 4, 2007. On September 22, 2009, [...] "Friend or Foe" [...] was released in the SpongeBob SquarePants: The First 100 Episodes DVD, alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{within the}} episode {{contains}} a controversial song about New Orleans, which describes {{the city as}} a [...] "home of pirates, drunks and whores", among other things. Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, had meant the song to be a parody of a song in , which speaks of London in unflattering terms ("There's No Place Like London"). Al Jean later explained that two Cajun characters were supposed to walk out of the theater in disgust, but none of the voice actors could provide a convincing Cajun accent. An early version of the scene can be seen in an <b>animatic</b> included in the DVD boxset.|$|E
50|$|Often storyboards are {{animated}} {{with simple}} zooms and pans to simulate camera movement (using non-linear editing software). These animations {{can be combined}} with available <b>animatics,</b> sound effects, and dialog to create a presentation of how a film could be shot and cut together. Some feature film DVD special features include production <b>animatics,</b> which may have scratch vocals or may even feature vocals from the actual cast (usually where the scene was cut after the vocal recording phase but before the animation production phase).|$|R
50|$|The first large {{professional}} {{project that}} used Blender was Spider-Man 2, {{where it was}} primarily used to create <b>animatics</b> and pre-visualizations for the storyboard department.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray on March 22, 2011. Bonus features include a 2-D animation test, deleted scenes, <b>animatics,</b> and a visual development featurette.|$|R
500|$|The animators {{needed to}} design {{completely}} new sets for the episode. Christian Roman, John Reiss, and Mike Anderson storyboarded the episode. In the original <b>animatic,</b> Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II were not present, so the animators {{went back and}} added them, {{even though they are}} {{not a part of the}} story. It is a common misconception that Scorpio's design was modeled after Richard Branson, which it was not. The final design, which underwent an overhaul, was hailed by the writers as [...] "the perfect madman". All of the students in Bart's remedial class were initially given hair modeled on Ralph Wiggum's, but the staff felt that the children looked [...] "kinda troubled", so their designs were altered.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS and DVD on March 1, 2005, in wide- and full-screen editions, by Paramount Home Entertainment. It contains an 18-minute featurette, The Absorbing Tale Behind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, featuring interviews {{with most of the}} principal cast and crew; a 15-minute featurette, Case of the Sponge [...] "Bob", hosted by Jean-Michel Cousteau; a 20-minute <b>animatic</b> segment featuring scenes from the film with dialogue by the original artists, and the film's trailer. The film was released as a Blu-ray-plus-DVD combination pack on March 29, 2011. A VHS version {{was released on}} March 1, 2005; it was the final VHS animated film from Nickelodeon Movies. As a tie-in to the film's DVD release, 7-Eleven served a limited-edition Under-the-Sea Pineapple Slurpee in March 2005.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode is a parody of American television show COPS; {{it was not in}} the original <b>animatic</b> and added later because the episode was too short to fit in its required 22-minute length. When Homer is performing a sock-puppet show to Lisa and Bart, he uses Akbar and Jeff, both of whom are characters from Matt Groening's weekly comic strip Life in Hell. Homer follows behind the house that was the birthplace of Edgar Allan Poe, which was placed in the episode by David Silverman. During this scene Homer starts to hear a heartbeat, a reference to Poe's [...] "The Telltale Heart". The scene where Homer sings in a church as a boy is based on the film Empire of the Sun.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series regular Kirker Butler, before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and before his leave from the series {{in order to become}} co-executive {{producer}} of the Family Guy spinoff series The Cleveland Show. Butler wrote the first draft of the episode in four weeks, under the guidance of series creator Seth MacFarlane. The episode was directed by Dominic Polcino, who had previously directed [...] "Blue Harvest". This was the last episode in the series to use hand-drawn <b>animatics,</b> before transitioning to computer-designed <b>animatics.</b>|$|R
5|$|In July 2013, Nickelodeon {{published}} a free interactive e-book, The Legend of Korra: Enhanced Experience, on iTunes. It contained material such as concept art, character biographies, <b>animatics</b> and storyboards.|$|R
5000|$|At its {{founding}} in 1971, Continuity primarily supplied motion picture storyboards and advertising art. As times changed, Continuity adapted its services to offer <b>animatics,</b> 3D computer graphics, and conceptual design.|$|R
500|$|On April 15, 2008, Nickelodeon and Paramount Home Entertainment {{released}} the episode on the DVD {{of the same}} name. The DVD featured six other episodes, including [...] "The Krusty Plate", [...] "Pat No Pay", [...] "The Inmates of Summer", [...] "To Save a Squirrel", [...] "20,000 Patties Under the Sea" [...] and [...] "The Battle of Bikini Bottom." [...] Bonus features include a [...] "Pest of the West" [...] original <b>animatic</b> and four [...] "Pest of the West" [...] shorts. It also became available in the [...] DVD on November 18, 2008. On September 22, 2009, [...] "Pest of the West" [...] was released in the SpongeBob SquarePants: The First 100 Episodes DVD, alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five.|$|E
500|$|... "Hell Is Other Robots" [...] {{is one of}} four episodes {{featured}} in the DVD boxed set Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection, Groening's favorite episodes from the first four seasons. [...] The DVD includes audio commentary from Groening and DiMaggio, as well as a full-length <b>animatic</b> of the episode. In an article on the DVD release, Winston-Salem Journal described [...] "Hell Is Other Robots" [...] as one of Futuramas best episodes. Dan Castellaneta's performance as the Robot Devil in this episode and [...] "The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings" [...] was described as a [...] "bravura appearance". [...] In a review of Futuramas first-season DVD release, the South Wales Echo highlighted the episode along with [...] "Fear of a Bot Planet" [...] as [...] "crazy episodes" [...] of the series. [...] Brian Cortis of The Age gave the episode a rating of three stars out of four.|$|E
500|$|... "The Man with Two Brians" [...] {{was written}} by John Viener and {{directed}} by Dominic Bianchi. In the storyboard <b>animatic</b> scene of Brian's rescue of a drowning Peter, music from [...] was used. The scene in which Peter broke his neck and the design of New Brian were both based on drawings by creator Seth MacFarlane. New Brian {{was supposed to be}} a Golden Retriever, but his color was changed so that he would stand out from the yellow kitchen. In the scene when Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero, the theme from E.T. was originally used. Several scenes were cut when the episode aired on television, mostly due to lack of time. The song New Brian sang to Peter {{was written by}} series writer Alec Sulkin. The original ending for the episode was a Beverly Hills, 90210 basketball joke, but it was cut.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Animatics</b> are a more {{elaborate}} {{version of a}} storyboard and include dialogue, sound tracks and voice overs that are intended to represent a more polished version of the final creative execution.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 D.W. {{started doing}} storyboards for Disney's One Saturday Morning show Tube Dwellers. For a season his duties {{included}} storyboarding and <b>animatics.</b> For the third season {{he took over}} as director.|$|R
50|$|The {{usage of}} storyboards, <b>animatics</b> or {{drawings}} {{is not exactly}} the same as throwaway prototyping, but certainly falls within the same family. These are non-functional implementations but show how the system will look.|$|R
