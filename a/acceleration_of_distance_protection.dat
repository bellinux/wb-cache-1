40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Distance</b> <b>{{protection}}s</b> {{are widely}} used in protection of energy transmission lines, but their time coordination is still an important and difficult problem. Inappropriate configuration leads to a hazard event: remote circuit breaker tripping provided the local circuit breaker can be opened, which severely impairs power system operation. OBJECTIVE: To describe a method and provide software tools to alleviate the hazard in power systems. METHODS: A domain specific language (DSL) for representation of a transmission line with its <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> schema, and a translation algorithm from the DSL to probabilistic fault trees with time dependencies (PFTTDs) are employed. RESULTS: The paper presents software tools that can support power protection experts in time coordination <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>protections.</b> The tools are based upon abstract and concrete syntax of the DSL designed specifically for the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> time coordination problem. In order to render creation of power line and its protection schema models easier, a DSL-dedicated editor supporting syntax and semantic aspects of the DSL has been developed. Additionally, a translator from the DSL into PFTTD language has been implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Power system experts are enabled to perform hazard probability assessment and sensitivity analysis. LIMITATIONS: Translation supports two types <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>protections,</b> which are: single-system relays with starting elements as well as multi-system relays without starting elements. For the single-system relay, there is one timer per relay. For multi-system relays, there is one timer for each of possibly many protection zones.

40|$|As {{the primary}} {{protection}} of high voltage (HV) and Extra high voltage (EHV) transmission networks, <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> needs to operate properly under all possible fault conditions. It needs {{to operate as}} fast as possible for internal fault, while it also must be able to discriminate between the internal and the external faults to prevent unnecessary trip of the normal system. In real life application, the operational characteristic <b>of</b> commercial <b>distance</b> relays such as operating time and reach accuracy are usually defined using the steady state conditions. This leads to difficulty in understanding the operational characteristic of the relay under the dynamic conditions such as faults.

40|$|The {{performance}} of power system protection {{is affected by}} out-of-step conditions in that system. Protection relays such as distance relays may detect an out-of-step condition and consequently operate to trip unfaulted lines. The tripping of unfaulted lines interrupts supply to loads and exacerbates an already existing stability problem. To prevent distance-relay operation during out-of-step conditions, <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> can incorporate out-of-step blocking protection. The purpose of the out-of-step blocking protection is to detect an out-of-step condition and, upon detection, block distance-relay operation. In the research the following were investigated: 1) The effect of out-of-step conditions on distance-protection performance 2) The performance <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> incorporating out-of-step blocking protection, during out-of-step conditions. A nine-bus IEEE benchmark network was chosen {{for the purposes of}} the research. The nine-bus network is representative, simple and small. It is a benchmark which is often used in comparative studies in the power system field. The nine-bus network data taken from reference [22] (see Table 3. 1 in Chapter 3) were consistently used for every study done. Mathematical protection models representing the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> <b>protection</b> incorporating out-of-step blocking protection were modelled in such a way as to simulate the protection of every line in the nine-bus network. These models were included in the power system model representing the nine-bus network. Two types of stability studies were done to investigate protection performance: a dynamic-stability study and a transient-stability study. IV In modelling the protection in the stability studies, it was found that a cascade effect of switching unfaulted lines can occur due to relay operation. Results also show that distance-protection performance improves with the application of out-of-step blocking protection. The research covers the following topics: 1) Dynamic stability 2) Transient stability 3) <b>Distance</b> <b>protection</b> 4) Out-of-step blocking protection results are discussed. An important conclusion reached is the need to take protection performance into account in routine stability studies. It will be shown that this may change the outcome of a stability study.
