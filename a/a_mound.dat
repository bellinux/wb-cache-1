5|$|Crewkerne Castle was {{possibly}} a Norman motte castle on <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> to the north-west of the town, {{which is known}} as Castle Hill. The town {{grew up in the}} late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved in its fifteenth century parish church. It later prospered as a coaching stop in the Georgian period.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside <b>a</b> <b>mound.</b> Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E

5|$|Userkaf's pyramid {{is part of}} {{a larger}} {{mortuary}} complex comprising a mortuary temple, an offering chapel and a cult pyramid as well as separate pyramid and mortuary temple for Userkaf's wife, queen Neferhetepes. Userkaf's mortuary temple and cult pyramid are today completely ruined and difficult to recognize. The pyramid of the queen is no more than <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> of rubble, with its funerary chamber exposed by stone robbers.|$|E
5|$|Gaozong {{received}} Helu's plea {{and agreed}} to his request, despite a Tang law ordering the execution of captured rebel generals and kings. In accordance with Confucian rituals, {{he was sent to}} Taizong's tomb where Gaozong spared his life, and then to the capital's Ancestral Temple where the captive was presented again, mirroring ancient rituals celebrating victorious armies. Helu felt disgraced by Taizong and committed suicide a year later while still in captivity. He was buried in <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> decorated with a stele outside the emperor's park. The tomb served as a military trophy, visible to the emperor's visitors entering the park, symbolizing the loyalty of the qaghan to the emperor and the Tang military victories against the Western Turks.|$|E

5|$|Grave Circle A, with a {{diameter}} of , is situated on the acropolis of Mycenae southeast of the Lion Gate. The site is surrounded by two rows of slabs, while {{the space between the}} rows was filled with earth and roofed with slabs. The Grave Circle contains six shaft graves, the smallest of which is measured at 3.0 m by 3.5 m and the largest measured at 4.50 m by 6.40 m (the depth of each shaft grave ranges from 1.0 m to 4.0 m). Over each grave <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> was constructed and stelae were erected. These stelae had been probably erected in memory of the Mycenaean rulers buried there; three of them depict chariot scenes.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> and an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, and could have acted as a motte.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{along the}} face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is another small Hindu {{excavation}} with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock. Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north spur of the main hill is <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> that resembles a Buddhist stupa. This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist stupa from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E

5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs. Unfortunately, taphonomical alterations (changes during the fossilization process) {{make it difficult to}} determine the original structure of the nest. Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus eggs were laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> of plant matter. Tanaka et al. (2015) noted that the shell had a high rate of water vapor conductance. Therefore, they concluded that Cairanoolithus nests were covered by organic or inorganic material, similar to modern eggs with high vapor conductance.|$|E
5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on <b>a</b> <b>mound,</b> greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.|$|E
5|$|St Aelrhiw's Church at Y Rhiw {{was built}} in 1860 on the {{footings}} of an earlier church. It consists of a small nave and short chancel; aisles {{to the north and}} south; and has boulder-built walls and a slate roof. The churchyard contains the graves of some of the bodies that were washed up at Porth Neigwl during the First World War. Above Porth Iago is the site of the ancient St Medin's Church; now just <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> {{in the middle of a}} field, it was the parish church of Bodferin.|$|E

50|$|The site {{consists}} of two <b>mounds,</b> <b>a</b> rectangular platform <b>mound</b> and <b>a</b> mortuary <b>mound,</b> and <b>an</b> associated village area. The site was occupied from 800 to 1300 CE by peoples of the Coles Creek and Plaquemine Mississippian cultures, although evidence found during excavations in 2004 showed that the site was occupied briefly in the Middle-Late Archaic period about 4000-1000 BCE. The platform <b>mound,</b> <b>Mound</b> <b>A,</b> is about 175 ft in width and 22 ft in height. It was described in the late 1930s by archaeologist James A. Ford as being 250 ft by 350 ft at its base and 25 ft in height. Archaeological investigations found {{the remains of a}} typical Mississippian-period thatched, clay-plastered log-post structure on the mounds summit, which was once a ceremonial temple or residence of a chief. Located 1200 ft northwest of <b>Mound</b> <b>A</b> is <b>Mound</b> B, <b>a</b> steep-sided conical <b>mound</b> 75 ft in diameter and 10 ft in height.|$|R

5|$|The 3.5 acre (1 ha) walled {{garden was}} {{restored}} in the 1980s. It includes an orchard, {{fruit and vegetable}} gardens, ornamental borders and a rose walk, {{as well as the}} national collection of tree quince (Cydonia oblonga), with 20different varieties. Close to the walled garden is a GradeII listed ice house, probably dating from the 18thcentury, which is constructed in brick covered with <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> of earth. The entrance is surrounded by stone walls, from which a tunnel leads to a circular domed chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} was unexpected, {{and almost}} certainly began some days {{before it became}} apparent at the surface. The sea floor at the eruption site is 130metres (426ft) below sea level, and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed, quenched and dissipated by the water pressure and density. Gradually, as repeated flows built up <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> of material that approached sea level, the explosions {{could no longer be}} contained, and activity broke the surface.|$|E
5|$|The lakes were {{deliberately}} {{designed so}} that their orientation was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretched {{from east to west}} and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hill—the future location of the new Parliament House on <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was {{designed so that}} looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} {{research}} and over a century of public interest, the most prominent features at Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park, <b>Mound</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Mound</b> B, remain virtually unexamined by modern archaeological techniques, and poorly understood. The tremendous scale and importance of these mounds makes most standard research methods difficult if not impossible. Electrical Resistivity Tomography, a geophysical technique rarely used in North America, was employed to survey both <b>Mound</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Mound</b> B, resulting in models of the subsurface that provide insights into the construction, modification and condition of the mounds...|$|R

5|$|The {{sculptured}} mounds {{sometimes have}} elaborate and distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of the compass termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau {{for the rest of the}} day until the evening.|$|E
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by <b>a</b> <b>mound</b> shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of <b>a</b> <b>mound,</b> so the {{northern}} side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
