5|$|After {{going without}} a rabbi {{for another two}} years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately {{advocated}} liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and separation of church <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> opposed prohibition, antisemitism, and Tammany Hall. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. He also supported California's compulsory sterilization {{of the mentally ill}} and mentally retarded, and eugenicist E. S. Gosney's advocacy on this issue.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} Jerusalem and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only Jerusalem and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration of church <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E

While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|High winds from Jimena {{knocked down}} trees and damaged power lines, leaving 1,300 {{residents}} without electricity.

5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying. Although {{it has never}} been played at the Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future. Its absence from the Olympics has been seen by the netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and funding sources.

5|$|The first {{histories}} of Henry's reign {{emerged in the}} 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. These early historians, including Archbishop Matthew Parker, were influenced by contemporary concerns about {{the roles of the}} Church <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> examined the changing nature of kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy. During the English Civil War, historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed Charles I.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the private}} sector was {{estimated}} to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%. The number of employees {{at all levels of}} government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1. While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power. The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing. In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, a {{disagreement}} arose between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the city; {{the city would}} not except the government's promise to finance part of the line. Both Minister of Transport and Communications, Dag Jostein Fj√¶rvoll from the Christian Democratic Party and Oslo City Commissioner of Transport and the Environment, Merete Agerbak-Jensen from the Conservative Party, agreed upon the distribution of funding from the city <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> both wanted construction to start as soon as possible. The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The city would pay NOK 224 million, while the state would pay NOK 673 million.|$|E

5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed the separation of church <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E
5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E
5|$|Lyndsay {{produced}} an interlude at Linlithgow Palace {{for the king}} and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568) and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed for court performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.|$|E

5|$|Netball is an Olympic {{recognised}} sport, {{a status}} attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period of lobbying. It {{has never been}} played at the Summer Olympics, but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met. The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game, depriving it of media attention and funding. Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of funds that the global netball community {{had not been able}} to access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> federal governments.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release back into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers ‚Äì in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> federal agencies ‚Äì through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The 1874 House {{elections}} {{produced a}} Democratic majority for the 44th Congress, and Blaine‚Äôs time as Speaker {{was at an}} end. This gave Blaine more time to concentrate on his presidential ambitions, and to develop new policy ideas. One result was a foray into education policy. In late 1875, President Grant made several speeches {{on the importance of}} the separation of church <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> the duty of the states to provide free public education. Blaine saw in this an issue that would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground. In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.|$|E
