5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E
5|$|Male spiders {{identify}} themselves {{by a variety}} of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E
2500|$|High-limit {{disability}} insurance {{is designed to}} keep individual disability benefits at 65% of income regardless of income level. Coverage is typically issued supplemental to standard coverage. With high-limit {{disability insurance}}, benefits can be <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> additional $2,000 to $100,000 per month. Single policy issue and participation (individual or group long-term disability) coverage has gone up to $30,000 with some hospitals.|$|R
5000|$|Passiflora arborea is {{a species}} of passion flower found in Columbia, Ecuador and Panama. The Passiflora arborea is a {{freestanding}} tree that can grow to be 50 feet tall.They germinate <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> elevation of 1400 - 2000 ft. The tree's leaves grow to be 1 to 1½ feet long. It is native to Columbia and is rarely seen in cultivation.|$|R
50|$|A {{key feature}} of this system was its {{backward}} compatibility: the same print could play <b>anywhere,</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> old drive-in theater with mono sound to a Dolby Stereo-equipped cinema, {{eliminating the need for}} a costly double inventory of prints for distribution. The success of Dolby Stereo resulted in the final demise of magnetic stereo on 35mm release prints. From then on, only 70mm prints used magnetic sound.|$|R
25|$|The weaving of pile rugs is a {{time-consuming}} process which, {{depending on}} the quality {{and size of the}} rug, may take <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few months to several years to complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinning}} sensation experienced from BPPV {{is usually}} triggered by {{movement of the}} head, will have a sudden onset, and can last <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few seconds to several minutes. The most common movements patients report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their heads upwards in order to look at something, and rolling over in bed.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} an {{experiment}} is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. Experiments can take place <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> college lab to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.|$|E
50|$|It begins after pudding {{is served}} {{and tends to}} last <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> half <b>an</b> hour to an hour. During summertime and holiday periods these after-dinner {{activity}} periods tend to last longer.|$|R

5000|$|Unadulterated emu oil {{can vary}} widely {{in color and}} {{viscosity}} <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> off-white creamy texture to a thin yellow liquid, depending on the diet of the emu and the refining method(s) used. Industrially refined [...] "emu grade" [...] emu oil is composed of a minimum of 70% unsaturated fatty acids. The largest component is oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid. Emu oil also contains roughly 20% linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and 1-2% linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid). Fully refined emu oil has a bland flavor.|$|R
25|$|Monitors running screensavers {{consume the}} same amount of power as when running normally, which can be <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few watts for small LCD {{monitors}} to several hundred for large plasma displays. Most modern computers can be set to switch the monitor into a lower power mode, blanking the screen altogether. A power-saving mode for monitors is usually part of the power management options supported in most modern operating systems, though it must also be supported by the computer hardware and monitor itself.|$|E
25|$|In {{the general}} election, he faced John Silber, the {{president}} of Boston University. Polls showed Weld <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> statistical tie to trailing {{by as many as}} ten points. Voter dissatisfaction with the state's Democratic majority gave Weld support for his promises to reduce the state deficit, lower the unemployment rate, and cut taxes. On November 6, 1990, he was elected as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts by a 50–47 margin, to become the first Republican governor of Massachusetts since Francis W. Sargent left office in 1975.|$|E
25|$|These {{spots are}} often {{followed}} {{within a few}} days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood, which blurs the vision. In extreme cases, a person may only be able to tell light from dark in that eye. It may take the blood <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few days to months or even years to clear from the inside of the eye, and in some cases the blood will not clear. These types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, {{membership}} in a college or university students' union is mandatory across Canada under various provincial statutes. Included in Canadian students' tuition fees is <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> additional $10-$500 fee {{to pay for the}} services of the union. The money raised from dues is often used to support a staff and office. Student elections usually happen around March as the membership elect their unions' executives. Student voter turnout for student elections is low for all institutions. The current largest undergraduate student union in Canada is the York Federation of Students, at the York University, with around 49,000 members.|$|R
50|$|A capsule {{review is}} a form of criticism, usually {{associated}} with journalism, that offers a relatively short critique of a specified artistic work (movie, music album, restaurant, painting, etc.). Capsule reviews generally appear in publications like newspapers and magazines, and can range <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> just <b>a</b> few sentences up to around 300 words.|$|R
25|$|Cleft lip and/or palate - Babies {{born with}} the defect will have opening in the {{vicinity}} of the upper lip. The size of the opening reaches <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> small notch to near towards the base of the nostril, in which it would either involve one or both sides of the lip. Worldwide, clefts are estimated to affect 1 in every 700-1000 live births. Roughly 25% of cleft lip and palate cases are inherited from parents, with the other 75% believed to be the cause of a combination of lifestyle and chance factors.|$|E
25|$|According to Jürgen Zarusky (originally {{published}} in a 1997 article in Dachauer Hefte), 16 SS men were shot in the coalyard (one more killed by a camp inmate), 17 in Tower B, and perhaps a few more killed by U.S. soldiers in the incident. <b>Anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few to 25 or 50 more were killed by inmates. Zarusky's research makes use of the detailed interrogation records contained in Whitaker's official May 1945 investigation report, which became accessible in 1992, {{as well as a}} collection of documents compiled by General Henning Linden's son.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{electronic}} analog computers contain <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few to {{a hundred}} or more operational amplifiers ("op amps"), named because they perform mathematical operations. Op amps are {{a particular type of}} feedback amplifier with very high gain and stable input (low and stable offset). They are always used with precision feedback components that, in operation, all but cancel out the currents arriving from input components. The majority of op amps in a representative setup are summing amplifiers, which add and subtract analog voltages, providing the result at their output jacks. As well, op amps with capacitor feedback are usually included in a setup; they integrate the sum of their inputs with respect to time.|$|E
5000|$|Remote Recorder feature enables {{users to}} {{schedule}} recordings <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> using <b>an</b> internet connection.|$|R
5000|$|These storylines are {{the bulk}} of the game. Each storyline is a long and {{involved}} set of plot-filled missions which are like [...] "playing" [...] a short story written in second person. Each story-line forces pilots to align themselves with a particular faction, restricting a player's freedom but giving him access to more powerful ships and technology. A single story-line can take <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> hour to several days to play to completion, depending on the player's level of experience and preferred pace. There also exist a few shorter minor stories and missions, which are difficult to find but have great rewards, such as the ability to use the old hypergate system.|$|R
50|$|In one case, the {{sergeant}} and two officers stopped {{a man in}} an apartment complex, took his keys and then ransacked his apartment without a warrant. They let the man go after taking several thousand dollars worth of drugs and cash. They also participated in various extortions, with illegal drug wholesalers giving the officers weekly payoffs that ranged <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> $600-1,000 <b>a</b> week.|$|R
25|$|There is {{debate about}} {{possible}} {{health and environmental}} effects. To address these concerns, A Risk Assessment Study of potential health risks of recycled water and comparisons to conventional Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Product (PPCP) exposures was conducted by the WateReuse Research Foundation. For each of four scenarios in which people {{come into contact with}} recycled water used for irrigation - children on the playground, golfers, and landscape, and agricultural workers - the findings from the study indicate that it could take <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few years to millions of years of exposure to nonpotable recycled water to reach the same exposure to PPCPs that we get in a single day through routine activities.|$|E
25|$|Depth {{of field}} can be <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{fraction}} of a millimeter to virtually infinite. In some cases, such as landscapes, it may be desirable to have the entire image sharp, and a large DOF is appropriate. In other cases, artistic considerations may dictate that {{only a part of}} the image be in focus, emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the background, perhaps giving only a suggestion of the environment (Langford 1973, 81). For example, a common technique in melodramas and horror films is a closeup of a person's face, with someone just behind that person visible but out of focus. A portrait or close-up still photograph might use a small DOF to isolate the subject from a distracting background. The use of limited DOF to emphasize one part of an image is known as selective focus, differential focus or shallow focus.|$|E
25|$|However, the Sotenos {{are best}} known for Tree of Life sculptures. The {{time it takes to}} {{complete}} a Tree depends on size and complexity, <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> day to two months of 15-hour workdays. Sizes can range from twenty centimeters to over a meter in height. The sculptures are made from the reddish and yellow clays found in a nearby community called Ocotitlán. The mined clay is left out to dry and the clumps broken up, sometimes but putting them out into the street for cars to roll over. As needed, the powdered clay is mixed with water and a flower called “tule” to soften and whiten the clay. The small details may be made with molds, but a number of artisans in the family, including Oscar, prefer to do it all by hand. Details and branches may be attached or reinforced by wire, but both Oscar and Tiburcio avoid the use of wire as it can break over time. The piece is carefully dried and fired. The largest trees may be fired in separate parts and in stages. Then they painted with anilines, natural pigments, acrylics and sometimes enamel.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} O gauge trains made of tinplate weren't scale at all, made to unrealistic, whimsical proportions similar in length to modern HO scale, but <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> one and <b>a</b> half to two times as wide and tall.|$|R
40|$|The {{aspiration}} {{of barium}} contrast {{is a rare}} complication that may occur during studies of the digestive tract. Barium is an inert material that can cause <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> asymptomatic mechanical obstruction to serious symptoms of respiratory distress that can result in patient death. We present {{the case of a}} 79 -year-old male patient in whom we observed the presence of contrast medium residue in the lung parenchyma as an incidental finding during hospitalization. When the patient’s medical file was reviewed, images were found of a barium swallow study that the patient had undergone months earlier, {{and we were able to}} observe the exact moment of the aspiration of the contrast material. The patient had been asymptomatic since the test...|$|R
50|$|Retarders {{are used}} to counter the fast drying {{properties}} of acrylic paints making possible the usage of wet on wet or other techniques which would otherwise require oil paints. Even if they will never give acrylic the working time oil paints permits, depending how much it is adding to paint, they can give <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> half <b>an</b> hour to a full day's working time.|$|R
500|$|The {{response}} to touch is very quick in Stylidium species. The column can complete its [...] "attack" [...] on the insect {{in as little}} as 15 milliseconds. After firing, the column resets to its original position in <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few minutes to a half hour, depending on temperature and species-specific qualities. The column is able to fire many times before it no longer responds to stimuli. The response time is highly dependent upon ambient temperature, with lower temperatures relating to slower movement. Stylidium species are typically pollinated by small solitary bees and the nectar-feeding bee flies (Bombyliidae).|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the tornado}} {{has a good}} source of warm, moist air flowing inward to power it, and it grows until it reaches the [...] "mature stage". This can last <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one mile (1.6 km) across. The low {{pressured}} atmosphere {{at the base of the}} tornado is essential to the endurance of the system. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. An important aspect of the game (as in nearly every visual novel) are the [...] "decision points" [...] which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options. The time between these decision points is variable and can occur <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> minute to much longer. The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays.|$|E
50|$|Keogtom has few followers, {{though they}} are found nearly <b>anywhere,</b> and are <b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of {{backgrounds}} and ideologies. He is especially popular among alchemists.|$|R
2500|$|Shorter trains may use railcars with an [...] "air-dump", which {{relies on}} air {{pressure}} from the engine plus a [...] "hot shoe" [...] on each car. This [...] "hot shoe" [...] when it comes into contact with a [...] "hot rail" [...] at the unloading trestle, shoots an electric charge through the air dump apparatus and causes the doors {{on the bottom of}} the car to open, dumping the coal through the opening in the trestle. Unloading one of these trains takes <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> hour to an hour and a half. Older unloaders may still use manually operated bottom-dump rail cars and a [...] "shaker" [...] attached to dump the coal. Generating stations adjacent to a mine may receive coal by conveyor belt or massive diesel-electric-drive trucks.|$|R
50|$|Eric Frankel {{left his}} job as President of Warner Bros. Domestic Cable Distribution to start StarGreetz in 2009. The company {{originally}} focused on using celebrities to create personalized greeting card videos on behalf of brands. As described by AdAge, “The video ad company charges advertisers $20,000 to $100,000 per month to run video ads personalized to each person they are served to -- the ads actually speak an individual's name and can include other personal information like where they live, provided that data is already available to the advertiser-- though advertisers have to pony up <b>anywhere</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> extra $10,000 to more than nine figures for celebrity spokespeople like country band Lady Antebellum or NASCAR driver Kyle Busch to parse each branded greeting ("Hi John Doe, {{let me tell you}} about brand").|$|R
