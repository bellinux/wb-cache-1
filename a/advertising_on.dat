5|$|<b>Advertising</b> <b>on</b> the Internet was liberalized by the Government in {{time for}} the 2011 general elections. Two forms of {{political}} <b>advertising</b> <b>on</b> the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E

5|$|DraftKings and FanDuel {{also became}} {{known for their}} use of direct {{response}} <b>advertising</b> <b>on</b> television, especially during sports telecasts. Capitalizing on the start of football season, iSpot.tv estimated that DraftKings and FanDuel collectively spent over $107 million on television advertising in September 2015 alone—with nearly half being spent on advertising during National Football League telecasts ($23.6 million by DraftKings, and $26.7 million spent by FanDuel). Of the total, $60.1 million was spent by DraftKings, with $7.95 million spent during college football games, $2.05 million during ESPN's sports news program SportsCenter, and $1.36 million during South Park episodes. The marketing push was met with a negative reaction from viewers on social networks such as Twitter, who considered the repetitive airplay of DFS commercials during football games to be an annoyance.|$|E

The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on Xbox Live and MSN. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and Windows. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned web sites. Microsoft also purchased {{a large amount of}} <b>advertising</b> <b>on</b> Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks, and collaborated on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and BET award shows, two Viacom owned cable networks.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, when {{candidates}} wish {{to publish}} election <b>advertising</b> <b>on</b> the Internet {{during the campaign}} period – that is, the period from {{the closure of the}} place of nomination on nomination day after the election is adjourned to enable a poll to be taken, {{to the start of the}} eve of polling day – they must provide to the returning officer, within 12 hours after the start of the period, declarations containing information on all the online platforms the advertising has appeared on in that time. Subsequently, a similar declaration must be provided before election advertising is published on such platforms.|$|E
5|$|Candidates {{may use the}} Internet {{to publish}} {{election}} advertising, including posting content on electronic media applications (such as digital banners, instant messaging software, mobile applications, RSS feed readers and widgets), social networking services and other websites, and sending e-mails. SMS and MMS messages can also be sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet {{that is used to}} publish election advertising within 12 hours after the start of the campaign period (that is, the time when the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents must use their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election <b>advertising</b> <b>on</b> the Internet is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, YouTube {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by <b>advertising</b> <b>on</b> the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos. YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.
