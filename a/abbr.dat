5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally tendered in 1912, after years of concern over {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the Nederlands-Indië (Netherlands East Indies, <b>abbr.</b> NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} Nachname and Hofname are not {{identical}} (usually {{because there was}} no male heir {{at some point in the}} family history) they are joined in official documents by genannt (<b>abbr.</b> gen.), e.g. Amann gen. Behmann. In Austria the term vulgo (<b>abbr.</b> vlg.) is used instead of genannt.|$|E

25|$|Gefreiter (<b>abbr.</b> Gfr) is a {{military}} rank of the Austrian Bundesheer. It might be comparable to enlisted men OR2/ private 1st Class ranks in Anglophone armed forces. However, in the Bundesheer {{it belongs to the}} so-called charges rank group (OR2 to OR4).|$|E
25|$|The Slovak National Gallery (<b>abbr.</b> SNG), {{founded in}} 1948, {{is the biggest}} network of {{galleries}} in Slovakia. Two displays in Bratislava are situated in Esterházy Palace (Esterházyho palác) and the Water Barracks (Vodné kasárne), adjacent one to another. They are located on the Danube riverfront in the Old Town.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few cars on Heligoland. A special section (§50) in the German traffic {{regulations}} (Straßenverkehrsordnung, <b>abbr.</b> StVO) prohibits the use of automobiles and bicycles on the island. No other region in Germany has any exceptions to the general regulations in the StVO, although other North Sea islands, such as Baltrum, have also banned the public from using cars and motorbikes.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands {{is divided}} into twelve provinces (provincie, pl. provincies). They form the tier of {{administration}} between the central government and the municipalities. Each province is governed by a provincial council, the States-Provincial (Provinciale Staten, <b>abbr.</b> to PS). Its members are elected every four years. The day-to-day management of the province {{is in the hands}} of the provincial executive, the States Deputed (Gedeputeerde Staten, <b>abbr.</b> to GS). Members of the executive are chosen by the provincial council from among its own members and like the members of the provincial council serve for a period of four years. Members elected to the executive have to give up their membership of the provincial council. The size of the executive varies from one province to another. In Flevoland, the smallest of the Dutch provinces, it has four members, while most other provinces have six or seven. Meetings of the provincial executive are chaired by the King's Commissioner (Commissaris van de Koning(in), <b>abbr.</b> to CvdK). The King's Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the King and government ministers). The appointment is for six years and may be extended by a second term. The King's Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate.|$|E
25|$|Each {{container}} is allocated {{a standardized}} ISO 6346 reporting mark (ownership code), four letters long ending in either U, J or Z, followed by six digits and a check digit. The ownership code for intermodal containers is {{issued by the}} Bureau International des Containers (International container bureau, <b>abbr.</b> B.I.C.) in France, hence the name BIC-Code for the intermodal container reporting mark. So far there exist only four-letter BIC-Codes ending in"U".|$|E
25|$|Gefreiter (<b>abbr.</b> Gefr. or G.) is {{the second}} enlisted rank grade within the modern-day Army (Heer), Air Force (Luftwaffe) and Navy (Marine) of the Bundeswehr. Following the NATO ranking system, Gefreiter equates to OR-2 on the NATO-standard rank scale, the rank is thus {{equivalent}} to either private, private first class, vice corporal or corporal rank depending on the chosen NATO-allied force used for the comparison. It is grade A4 in the pay scale of the Federal Ministry of Defence.|$|E
25|$|Municipalities (gemeente, pl. gemeenten) {{form the}} lowest tier of {{government}} in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (gemeenteraad) is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is {{comparable to that of}} the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job is to decide the municipality's broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality {{is in the hands of}} the municipal executive (college van burgemeester en wethouders, <b>abbr.</b> to (college van) B), made up of the mayor (burgemeester) and the aldermen (wethouder, pl. wethouders). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality's public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years and are normally re-appointed automatically for another term, provided the municipal council agrees. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.|$|E
