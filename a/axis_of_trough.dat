However, in Smyth, Jackson, and Cooper’ study (2014), little evidence supported that wind flow was being steered along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the blowout, rather the flow remained constant to the direction that it was flowing before or showed other characteristics like turbulent separated flows.|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} of motion of the cross-beds can show ancient flow or wind directions (called paleocurrents). The foresets are deposited at the angle of repose (~34 degrees from the horizontal), so geologists are able to measure dip {{direction of}} the cross-bedded sediments and calculate the paleoflow direction. However, most cross-beds are not tabular, they are troughs. Since troughs can give a 180 degree variation of the dip of foresets, false paleocurrents can be taken by blindly measuring foresets. In this case, true paleocurrent direction {{is determined by the}} <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough.</b> Paleocurrent direction is important in reconstructing past climate and drainage patterns: sand dunes preserve the prevalent wind directions, and current ripples show the direction rivers were moving.|$|R

50|$|Geosyncline is a {{geological}} concept {{which was}} developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries before the concept of plate tectonics was developed. A geosyncline was described as a subsiding linear trough that was caused by the accumulation of sedimentary rock strata deposited in a basin and subsequently compressed, deformed, and uplifted into a mountain range, with attendant volcanism and plutonism. The filling of a geosyncline with sediment is accompanied in the late stages of deposition by folding, crumpling, and faulting of the deposits. Intrusion of crystalline igneous rock and regional uplift along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> generally complete the history of a particular geosyncline. It is then transformed into a belt of folded mountains. Thick volcanic sequences, together with greywackes (sandstones rich in rock fragments with a muddy matrix), cherts, and various sediments reflecting deepwater deposition or processes, were considered eugeosynclinal deposits of the outer deepwater segment of geosynclines.|$|R

Emphasis was put on closely-spaced heat flow measurements around knolls and small basins near the trough axis in order to clarify the nature of thermal anomalies, which {{were expected to be}} related to hydrothermal activity. In the axial graben of the southern Okinawa Trough, heat flow values obtained within 2 km of an axial volcano (the Yaeyama Central Knoll) were less than 50 mW/m 2 and showed large scatter. These low heat flow values can be explained as they are measured in the recharge area of the hydrothermal circulation, which is presumed to discharge at the Yaeyama Central Knoll. In the axial part of the middle Okinawa Trough, heat flow values measured in a basin to the east of the Natsushima- 84 Deep, which was known to have high heat flow, were 710 ± 690 mW/m 2. This indicates that the thermally active area extends along the central <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough.</b> High and variable heat flow (360 ± 220 mW/m 2) was also found in a cauldron, about 35 km to the south <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the middle Okinawa Trough.

Some dredge hauls from the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> King's <b>Trough</b> and Palmer Ridge contain lithologic and stratigraphic units that are absent at Site 608 either because they predate basement formation at the drill site or because they fall within the range of the major upper Eocene-lower Oligocene hiatus that drilling penetrated. Combining the data sets confirms and refines previous models of formation for the complex that involve rifting of an aseismic ridge or hot-spot trace that began its development at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the early Eocene (about 56 Ma). Two major intraplate tectonic events subsequently affected this ridge: (1) in the late Eocene (about 32 Ma), intru-sion of trachytic rocks along fault planes, uplift, and explosive volcanicity near sea level; and (2) in the early middle Mi-ocene (about 20 Ma), extensional rifting and subsidence of the basins and deeps of the complex through step-faulting. Palmer Ridge became isolated as a sliver of exposed deep ocean crust during this subsidence. We refrain from discussing new plate kinematic models for the Northeast Atlantic and western Europe, but point out that, whereas the ridge uplift and intraplate volcanism was coeval with the main phase of the Pyrenean orogeny, the extension and rifting <b>of</b> the King's <b>Trough</b> complex was independent of events on the European margin.

40|$|The Jackfork (~roup in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas is an Upper Mississippian flysch {{succession}} that displays readily distinguishable lithofacies. The frontal Ouachitas {{contain a}} preponderance of disturbed beds which are interbedded with turbidite sandstones. These disturbed and disrupted beds developed {{at the foot of}} a northern unstable slope, the resultant bedding dependent upon the type of material involved, its state of consolidation, and the distance moved. Information gathered concerning the progressive changes from one type of sedimentary structure to another gives a qualitative measure of downslope distance. Muds which undergo submarine deformation upon a sloping sea floor first become flowage shales which change to blocky mudstones with continued failure. Failure of plastic muds and cohesive sandstone progressively form con-torted, chaotic, and. rubble bedding. Deformation of muds and sands form slurried bedding and breecias. Movement of flowing, creeping, or sliding clean sand may have occurred but is not considered to be a type of disruptive bedding. The deformation of mobilized, liquefied sand under some sediment cover produced load structures, audstone dikes, and intrastratal flow structure.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Quaternary Science Reviews [© Elsevier Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] Fjord is a relatively uniform, steep-walled basin, whose floor has an almost smooth surface. Debris is supplied mainly from icebergs from the fast-flowing Kangerlussuaq Glacier. Sedimentation after iceberg release from multi-year sea ice is mainly by rain-out of fine-grained englacial debris. Streamlined glacial lineations and drumlins were produced at the sedimentary bed of an ice sheet that expanded into Kangerlussuaq Trough at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Bedrock channels and crescentic overdeepenings indicate warm-based ice and free water beneath parts of the former ice sheet. Cross-cutting iceberg scour marks, which characterise outer Kangerlussuaq shelf, were produced not only during deglaciation, but also occasionally through the Holocene by deep-keeled icebergs from further north in East Greenland. The outward-convex contours of the shelf edge and slope beyond Kangerlussuaq Trough, and debris flows on the slope, suggest a glacier-influenced high-latitude fan. The distribution of streamlined subglacial landforms demonstrates that the Greenland Ice Sheet extended throughout Kangerlussuaq Fjord and reached at least 200 km across the shelf in Kangerlussuaq Trough at the LGM. Streamlined landform orientation indicates ice flow from the interior of Greenland down the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> Kangerlussuaq <b>Trough.</b> There is little evidence for discrete sedimentary depocentres in the trough, implying that ice probably retreated rapidly from the outer and mid shelf during deglaciation...|$|R
40|$|The Benue trough is Nigeria’s main, but not {{exclusive}} {{source of}} barite mineralisation. There {{are at least}} ten barite fields in the trough, each containing swarms of veins or concordant stratiform minerals flats of hydrothermal origin. There are only two vein trends in the trough: the NW-SE trend, which tends to be orthogonal to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the trough; and the N-S to NNE-SSW trend, which is younger than the former. Both vein sets are formed from ac tension joints reflecting different post-sedimentary deformation phases in the trough. The NW-SE veins are also more frequent than the N-S veins, almost in the ration of 2 : 1. Although 86 veins have been studied, not one was found oriented parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough,</b> a good indication of structural control on mineral vein orientations. The dips of the veins tend to be high (> 80 o), a condition that favours manual mining. Veins tend to display a simple block profile and their widths vary from a few centimetres {{to as much as}} 6 m, though the most frequently occurring widths are between 50 cm and 1 m. The implication of this is that BaSO 4 concentrations in hydrothermal fluids in the trough were probably low during the Cretaceous period. In many veins, there is barite quality contrast between the top part and the lower portions. Higher quality barite tends to come from the lower portions. Hence it is expected that much of the low quality stigma associated with Nigerian barite from the trough would be relieved when mining gets down to good depths. For this reason, mining in those veins of low quality barite should proceed by vertical stripping. </p...|$|R

We also addressed the sequential conversion of saponite to chlorite (S–C), which can be a significant source of fluid in the seismogenic zone, providing fluid volumes that are almost one order of magnitude greater than in the overriding sediments. The aim of the present work is to strengthen our previous dataset and to explore the states and pathways of basalt alteration along the plate interface. In particular, our work is directed toward {{a better understanding of the}} way in which dehydration proceeds within the seismogenic zone. To these ends, we have examined the whole-rock and clay-fraction mineralogy of several basalt fragments that were subjected to alteration under various temperatures in an ancient subduction zone, and which are now exhumed as members of the ancient Shimanto Belt accretionary complex in southwest Japan. As a result of this work, we are now able to demonstrate the possible connections between basalt dehydration and plate-boundary seismogenesis in a subduction zone.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn a {{parabolic}} trough system, the solar flux distribution {{on the surface}} of absorber tube is non-uniform which results in circumferential temperature gradient. Thus, bending moment is induced and leads to the deflection in absorber tube from the focal line <b>of</b> <b>trough.</b> It is concluded that during zero angle of incidence of sun rays (angle made by sun rays with trough's aperture normal), absorber tube will not deflect from the focal line. However, during non-zero angle of incidence, the absorber tube will deflect. It is {{because of the fact that}} during non-zero angle of incidence, the absorber tube does not receive any concentrated flux near the end facing the sun. In the current work, an analytical expression is derived for finding the deflection in the central <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> absorber tube from the focal line <b>of</b> <b>trough.</b> Results for deflection are plotted for different values of angle of incidence taking the dimensions of LS 3 {{parabolic trough}} with Schott 2008 PTR 70 receiver...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Late Cretaceous {{sedimentary}} {{marine and}} deltaic rocks of Gabriola Island were mapped and studied {{during the summer}} of 1971. Cretaceous strata constitute all the exposed outcrops on the island, which is the northernmost of the Gulf Island chain of British Columbia. The upper four formations of the Nanaimo Group are recognized, totalling 2707 feet in composite section, The thinly laminated marine mudstones and siltstones of the Northumberland and Spray Formations are separated by deltaic sandstones and conglomerates of the Geoffrey Sandstone. The younger Gabriola Sandstone lacks the conglomerate units. Although unconformities between the formations may exist on a regional basis, locally the major contacts are sharp and planar. The marine strata are characterized by fine-grained, thinly laminated beds, and an abundant ammonite fauna, indicative of a low energy, open marine environment. The deltaic units are mediumto coarse-grained arkosic wackes and pebble-cobble conglomerates representing a nearby source, and a high energy, nearshore environment in which little sediment reworking occurred and burial was rapid. The minerals and lithic clasts of the deltaic units exhibit practically no variation throughout the sections. Source areas are considered to be the older formations on Vancouver Island. Channel <b>axis</b> measurements <b>of</b> festoon <b>trough</b> cross-bedding, plus orientation of sole marks and parting lineations, indicate a predominant northwest current transport direction for the upper two formations. Soft-sediment slumping and flame structures support the probability of a northerly to northwesterly declining paleoslope. The Cretaceous sequence forms the broad, open, east trending Gabriola syncline. Intersecting the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the syncline on {{the north end of the}} island is the tight, asymmetrical, northeast-trending Lock Bay anticline. Northwest-trending vertical faults occur parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the Gabriola syncline. Cross-cutting the syncline axis at both ends of the island are northeast-trending vertical faults. Except for that involving the steep limb of the Lock Bay anticline, no folding of the strata was observed. Although further work is needed, it is postulated that the Sp-ay Formation marks the end of basinal downwarping of the Georgia Seaway and the Gabriola Sandstone marks the close of Cretaceous tectonic activity within the coastal ranges of Vancouver Island...|$|R
40|$|A {{refraction}} and wide-angle reflection seismic profile {{along the}} <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the Salton <b>Trough,</b> California and Mexico, was analyzed to constrain crustal and upper mantle seismic velocity structure during active continental rifting. From the northern Salton Sea {{to the southern}} Imperial Valley, the crust is 17 – 18 [*]km thick and approximately one-dimensional. The transition at depth from Colorado River sediment to underlying crystalline rock is gradual {{and is not a}} depositional surface. The crystalline rock from ~ 3 to ~ 8 [*]km depth is interpreted as sediment metamorphosed by high heat flow. Deeper felsic crystalline rock could be stretched preexisting crust or higher-grade metamorphosed sediment. The lower crust below ~ 12 [*]km depth is interpreted to be gabbro emplaced by rift-related magmatic intrusion by underplating. Low upper mantle velocity indicates high temperature and partial melting. Under the Coachella Valley, sediment thins to the north and the underlying crystalline rock is interpreted as granitic basement. Mafic rock does not exist at 12 – 18 [*]km depth as it does to the south, and a weak reflection suggests Moho at ~ 28 [*]km depth. Structure in adjacent Mexico has slower midcrustal velocity, and rocks with mantle velocity must be much deeper than in the Imperial Valley. Slower velocity and thicker crust in the Coachella and Mexicali valleys define the rift zone between them to be > 100 [*]km wide in the direction of plate motion. North American lithosphere in the central Salton Trough has been rifted apart and is being replaced by new crust created by magmatism, sedimentation, and metamorphism...|$|R
