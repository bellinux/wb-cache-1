5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself.

5|$|Two of the 8th century picture stones {{from the}} island of Gotland, Sweden depict eight-legged horses, which are thought by most {{scholars}} to depict Sleipnir: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone. Both stones feature <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> sitting atop an eight-legged horse, which some scholars view as Odin. Above the rider on the Tjängvide image stone is a horizontal figure holding a spear, which may be a valkyrie, and a female figure greets the rider with a cup. The scene has been interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> arriving at {{the world of the}} dead. The mid-7th century Eggja stone bearing the Odinic name haras (Old Norse 'army god') may be interpreted as depicting Sleipnir.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.|$|E

5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. <b>A</b> <b>rider</b> can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E
5|$|Many riders {{were named}} as contenders, {{including}} Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong {{was considered an}} overall favorite, {{and it was also}} noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> very likely to gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.|$|E

50|$|When in harness {{or under}} saddle, the horse may express displeasure or {{resistance}} to a handler's commands, particularly <b>a</b> <b>rider's</b> leg command to move forward, by twisting or wringing its tail.

Because tail-swishing can indicate a horse resistant to <b>a</b> <b>rider's</b> commands, the practice is generally penalized at horse shows in events where manners or responsive performance are judged.|$|R

5|$|Roberts' son, Kenny Roberts Jr., won the 2000 500cc World Championship, {{making them}} the only {{father and son}} duo to have won the title. Ironically, Roberts has stated that he {{considers}} himself a dirt tracker at heart and only took up road racing because {{it was necessary to}} do so if <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> was going to compete for the Grand National championship. He also said that he would have preferred to remain in the United States to compete in the Grand National championship if Yamaha or another manufacturer had been able to construct a dirt track racer capable of competing with Harley-Davidson.|$|E
5|$|Surnames that mention {{animals can}} also be toponymic, the names Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all {{denoting}} people who came from these villages associated with horses.

5|$|The Tjängvide image stone {{from the}} Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden {{features}} <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> on an eight-legged horse, {{which may be}} Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the study of bike {{dynamics}} is nearly as old as the bicycle itself. It includes contributions from famous scientists such as Rankine, Appell, and Whipple. In the early 19th century Karl von Drais, credited with inventing the two-wheeled vehicle variously called the laufmaschine, velocipede, draisine, and dandy horse, showed that <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> could balance his device by steering the front wheel. In 1869, Rankine published an article in The Engineer repeating von Drais's assertion that balance is maintained by steering {{in the direction of a}} lean.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by <b>a</b> <b>rider,</b> or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|By {{their own}} admission, Astana does not {{aim for the}} classics. The team first participated in Omloop Het Volk on March 1, with Dmitriy Muravyev in 31st their best-placed rider. Sergei Ivanov's 7th in the Amstel Gold Race proved {{to be one of}} the team's best results all season, as in the other spring races in which they competed, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, the Tour of Flanders, and Gent–Wevelgem, they did not have <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> place higher than 13th. Due in part to the ban imposed by the Amaury Sport Organisation from {{participating}} in races they organized, the team did not compete in Milan–San Remo, Paris–Roubaix, La Flèche Wallonne, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, or other races in which a team of their caliber would normally take part. In March, Tomas Vaitkus earned the team's lone one-day victory of the spring season, winning a sprint finish to the Ronde van het Groene Hart.|$|E
