Although not being near as wealthy <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be during his first vizierate, he delivered food and money to the needy, and sent several expensive gifts to Mas'ud {{in order to avoid}} the jealousies which resulted in his fallout with Mahmud.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} years {{led to an}} estrangement between Barbarossa and Henry. Henry ceased to support the Emperor's Italy campaigns, which were all proven unsuccessful, as massively <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> and instead focused on his own possessions. In 1175 Barbarossa again asked for support against the Lombard League, which Henry {{is said to have}} refused bluntly, even though Barbarossa kneeled before him. Records of this event were not written until several years later, and sources are contradictory, depending on whom the author favoured. Nevertheless, lacking the support of the Saxons the following Battle of Legnano was a complete failure for the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Twelve and the Epilogue detail {{events of}} {{over two years}} past Rudin’s arrival at Dar’ya Mikhailovna’s estate. Lezhnev is happily married to Aleksandra. He arrives to give her news of Sergei’s {{engagement}} to Natasha, {{who is said to}} “seem contented”. Pigasov lives with Lezhnevs, and amuses Aleksandra <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> amuse Dar’ya Mikhailovna. A conversation which follows happens to touch on Rudin, and as Pigasov begins to make fun of him, Lezhnev stops him. He then defends Rudin’s “genius” while saying that his problem is that he had no “character” in him. This, again, refers to the superfluous man’s inability to act. He then toasts Rudin. The chapter ends with the description of Rudin travelling aimlessly around Russia. In the Epilogue, Lezhnev happens by chance to meet Rudin at a hotel in a provincial town. Lezhnev invites Rudin to dine with him, and over the dinner Rudin relates to Lezhnev his attempts to “act” – to improve an estate belonging to his friend, to make a river navigable, to become a teacher. In all three of this attempts Rudin demonstrated inability to adapt to the circumstances of Nicholas I’s Russia, and subsequently failed, and was in the end banished to his estate. Lezhnev then appears to change his opinion of Rudin as inherently inactive, and says that Rudin failed exactly because he could never stop striving for truth. The Epilogue ends with Rudin’s death at the barricades during the French Revolution of 1848; even at death he is mistaken by two fleeing revolutionaries for a Pole.|$|E

500|$|Smart had a {{reputation}} for being a [...] "dedicated gardener". His poem the Hop-Garden helped to further this reputation, and even during his stay in a mental asylum he convinced others of his bond with nature. Johnson witnessed Smart's time in asylum and stated, [...] "he has partly as much exercise <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> have, for he digs in the garden."

Yoga Journal Derk Richardson wrote that Shankar's fast fingering and [...] "ingenious note choices... conspire to create a mesmerizing swirl". Richardson complimented all instrumental performers, as well as producer Hans Wendl, for recording the ensemble with [...] "striking clarity", and called Shankar's playing [...] "timeless". Bill Meyer wrote in his 2005 review for the Chicago Reader that Shankar was not as fast <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be {{but that he was}} still a [...] "thrilling improviser".|$|E

500|$|Moffat was {{inspired}} by a crack in his son's bedroom wall and developed the idea into the main story arc for the fifth series. He thought that a child might think that something interesting lived inside such a crack. The hidden room in Amelia's house was based on Moffat's recurring childhood dream of a nonexistent hidden room in his grandmother's house. Moffat was keen to give the monster a giant eyeball, and commented that the Atraxi's design— a giant eyeball on a star— was easy for children to draw, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> draw Doctor Who monsters as a child. These aspects reflect Doctor Who [...] "domestically-scaled menace" [...] principle. Moffat wrote a scene that explained Prisoner Zero's crime, but cut it because he figured no one would care.|$|E
500|$|Boruto is a {{child who}} attends Konoha's ninja academy, inheriting his {{paternal}} families' short blond hair, blue eyes and [...] verbal tic. He also inherits his maternal families' Gentle Fist technique despite not inheriting the Byakugan unlike his sister, Himawari. Like Naruto, Boruto commits mischief to get attention, but for different reasons. Due to his father becoming the Hokage (the leader of Konoha), he does not spend any time with him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> From defacing the Hokage Monument during {{the events of the}} series epilogue of Naruto, his father stops him and explains that he needs to care for their village. He makes a brief appearance in Naruto Gaiden where he gives a meal to his comrade Sarada Uchiha to pass on to his father; she becomes motivated to become the Hokage after the day she had.|$|E
500|$|In {{the race}} the early pace was slow, and Barrett {{positioned}} Orme {{near the front}} of the field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme was just leading from La Fleche, but Barrett soon picked up the whip and it was clear Orme was beaten. La Fleche went on to win easily by two lengths from Sir Hugo, with Watercress a further three lengths back in third, May Duke in fourth and Orme in fifth. The remainder of the field, led by The Lover, were at least twenty lengths behind Orme. After the race Barrett said: [...] "I never was so disappointed in my life. He never took hold of his bit <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do; run as dead as a stone, and wouldn't make an effort." [...] Other jockeys in the race agreed, saying Orme was [...] "sulking" [...] throughout the race. After the race, some suggested that Orme simply did not stay, the St Leger distance being too far for him.|$|E

500|$|The character's {{return in}} April 2008 saw drastic changes to his personality. [...] Edmondson attested that Abra {{returned}} in [...] "a fragile state" [...] following a traumatic {{incident in the}} Congo, and had become [...] "genuinely horrible". He said of the transformation: [...] "He's not as humorous <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. I used to like that, that sardonic wit {{that he used to}} have and it's kind of gone out of the window. But you can be quite funny when you're feeling everything's pointless. He does some things that are so cruel and cold that they're actually quite funny." [...] While the character had once been known for his brash taste in bright, flamboyant shirts, The Sun noted that Abra's return saw him a [...] "shadow of his former self", wearing far less colourful apparel as a reflection of his more subdued state of mind. [...] Edmondson agreed that Abra's new wardrobe of shirts [...] "aren't quite as bright and dazzling - but that suits his current mood." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Jillian was altered several {{times by the}} show producers before its original airing; however, the final character personality {{was designed to be}} that of [...] "a bulimic cheerleader." [...] The {{character of}} Jillian was also designed to be [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree," [...] but this too was repeatedly changed. The description of Jillian's voice being that of a bulimic cheerleader somewhat relates to a future episode plot, where Stewie calls Jillian fat, to which she responds by leaving the room and throwing up. When Stewie exclaims [...] "it's like she's fucking five," [...] this was not set to broadcast at its original air date, but rather added in at a later date for unknown reasons. When Stewie is entertaining the elderly citizens by singing a song entitled [...] "there's a hole {{in the bottom of the}} sea," [...] this is actually Seth MacFarlane's father playing the guitar, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sing it to Seth when he was a child. During the making of this episode, not much thought was put into the character of Jillian, despite the fact she was always meant to be recurring character; although her regular appearances throughout season 5 were described as [...] "a big thing for Family Guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song. It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is about more than just what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E

500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he was the}} {{youngest}} of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred [...] "could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time".|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's [...] "rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of Max Scheler's volcanic fire." ...|$|E
