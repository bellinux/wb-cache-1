Martin commented that she was extraordinary in her audition, in which she read the scene where Shae meets Tyrion in a tent the night before the battle of the Green Fork. According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to take every one of our Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made you fall in love with her as well." ...|$|E

60|$|Herbert caught <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relief, {{and orders}} were given accordingly. It seemed a cruel moment {{to tell him}} of young Hornblower's evasion and robbery, but the police wanted the {{description}} of the articles; and, in fact, nothing would have so brought home to him that, though Compton might not appreciate minutiae of Greek criticism, yet the habit of diligence, of which it was the test, might make a difference there. The lingering self- justification was swept away by the sense of the harm his pleasure- seeking had done to the lad whom he had once influenced. He had been fond and proud of his trophies, but he scarcely wasted a thought on them, so absorbed was he in the thought of how he had lorded it over the youth with that late rebuke. The blame he had refused to take on himself then came full upon him now, and he reproached himself too much to be angered at the treachery and ingratitude.|$|E

From his drawings Aaron got to his instruments, and before bedtime was teaching Susan how to draw parallel lines. Susan found that she had quite an aptitude for parallel lines, and altogether had a good time of it that evening. It is dull to go on week after week, and month after month, talking only to one's mother and sister. It is dull though one does not oneself recognise it to be so. A little change in such matters is so very pleasant. Susan had not the slightest idea of regarding Aaron as even a possible lover. But young ladies do like the conversation of young gentlemen.

But literature is not a temple, and it should not be assigned the function of sacred texts. Russian writers shouldn’t be made into priests.” [...] Bro is significant because it shows that Sorokin's urge to break away from traditional Russian literature goes along with his intent to mirror actual events in society with this novel. Sorokin states, [...] "To my mind the entire Ice Trilogy is a discussion of the twentieth century. It’s a kind of monument to it. You can look <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metaphor, or as science fiction, or as some sort of conspiratorial novel."
