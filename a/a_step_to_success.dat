40|$|Abstract—Unit-level {{verification}} is <b>a</b> critical <b>step</b> <b>to</b> the <b>success</b> of full-chip {{functional verification}} for microprocessor designs. In the unit-level verification, a unit is first {{embedded in a}} complex software that emulates the behavior of surrounding units, and then a sequence of stimuli is applied to measure the functional coverage. In order to generate such a sequence, designers need to comprehend the relationship between boundaries at the unit under verification and at the inputs to the emulation software. However, figuring out this relationship can be very difficult. Therefore, this paper 1 proposes an incremental learning frame-work that incorporates an ordered-binary-decision-forest(OBDF) algorithm, to automate estimating the controllability of unit-level signals and to provide full-chip level information for designers to govern these signals. Mathematical analysis shows that the proposed OBDF algorithm has lower model complexity and lower error variance than the previous algorithms. Meanwhile, a commercial microprocessor core is also applied to demonstrate that controllability of input signals on the load/store unit in the microprocessor core can be estimated automatically and information about how to govern these signals can also be extracted successfully.

This paper investigates the risk factors and assesses the risk level of PPP water supply projects in developing countries using fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) approach. A 40 -factor risk list was established through investigation in water projects cases and related literature and an industry-wide questionnaire survey with industry practitioners. Initial statistical analysis yielded 22 critical risk factors that would have significant impacts on water supply partnerships. These factors were categorized into three principal factors (financial/commercial, legal and socio-political, and technical) forming the input variables for FSE analysis. The study showed that the overall risk level of water PPPs in developing countries is high, suggesting that these projects are risky to both governments and private participants. The fuzzy analysis, overall, confirmed that financial/commercial risk category is the most critical principal factor, followed by legal and socio-political category and technical category. The FSE approach to risk assessment {{can be used as}} an initial screening to establish risk factors that require attention of management and further detailed analysis. This study demonstrates that FSE methodology can be used to synthetically analyze local conditions in a country prior to setting up the project structure and normal due diligence.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the readiness of Shiraz teaching hospitals to implement Electronic Medical Record. Method: This study was a cross-sectional descriptive study done in 2015. The study population included Health Information Management (HIM) staff of Shiraz teaching hospitals. Five hospitals from a total of 14 hospitals were selected as Single-stage cluster sampling with a population of 79 health information management staff. Data collection was performed by using a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of three main dimensions including technical, organizational and legal requirements. For data analysis, SPSS software version 16 and one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for comparisons between five hospitals were used. Results:The results showed that Shiraz teaching hospitals have high readiness (3. 66 out of 5) to implement Electronic Medical Record. Shiraz teaching hospitals are better prepared in terms of legal requirements. Also, a significant difference was not observed among the hospitals in any of the technical, organizational and legal aspects (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Due to {{the importance}} of the technical, organizational and legal aspects in the implementation of Electronic Medical Record, it is recommended that the authorities consider these aspects in implementation of Electronic Medical Record.

During the treatment, height measurement {{at regular intervals}} is <b>a</b> vital <b>step</b> <b>to</b> assess <b>success.</b> <b>To</b> date, {{there have been no}} previous studies on GH treatment in Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, the referral hospital in East Indonesia. Objective To compare body height between pre- and post-growth hormone treatment in pediatric patients. Method This study was a non-randomized, pre-post clinical trial performed at Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya. The prospective cohort was accessed during January 2008 -June 2013. The inclusion criteria was GH treatment for more than 3 months. Clinical data on GH treatment, including diagnosis, age, height pre-and post-treatment, height gain, duration of treatment, and parental satisfaction were collected. Two-tailed, paired T-test and Pearson’s test were used for statistical analyses. Result Nineteen patients underwent GH treatment during the study period, but only twelve patients had complete data and were included in the study. Eight subjects were female. Subjects’ mean age was 11 (range 8 - 15) years. Nine patients had GHD, 2 had TS, and 1 had SGA. Mean pre-treatment height was 121. 05 cm, while mean post-treatment height was 130. 5 cm. Mean duration of treatment was 10. 5 (range 3 - 30) months. Mean height gain was 0. 8 cm/month in GHD and SGA cases, and 0. 78 cm/month for the TS cases. Eleven parents reported satisfaction with the results of GH treatment in their children. There is significant diffrent between pre- and post-treatment (P= 0. 001). Pearson’s correlation test (r= 0. 90) revealed a strong correlation between growth hormone treatment and height gain.

Since generating an effective facial representation is <b>a</b> vital <b>step</b> <b>to</b> the <b>success</b> of facial emotion recognition, a modified Local Gabor Binary Pattern operator is first employed to derive a refined initial face representation and we then propose two evolutionary algorithms for feature optimization including (i) direct similarity and (ii) Pareto-based feature selection, under the layered cascade model. The direct similarity feature selection considers characteristics within the same emotion category that give the minimum within-class variation while the Pareto-based feature optimization focuses on features that best represent each expression category {{and at the same}} time provide the most distinctions to other expressions. Both a neural network and an ensemble classifier with weighted majority vote are implemented for the recognition of seven expressions based on the selected optimized features. The ensemble model also automatically updates itself with the most recent concepts in the data. Evaluated with the Cohn-Kanade database, our system achieves the best accuracies when the ensemble classifier is applied, and outperforms other research reported in the literature with 96. 8 % for direct similarity based optimization and 97. 4 % for the Pareto-based feature selection. Cross-database evaluation with frontal images from the MMI database has also been conducted to further prove system efficiency where it achieves 97. 5 % for Pareto-based approach and 90. 7 % for direct similarity-based feature selection and outperforms related research for MMI. When evaluated with 90 ° side-view images extracted from the videos of the MMI database, the system achieves superior performances with > 80 % accuracies for both optimization algorithms. Experiments with other weighting and meta-learning combination methods for the construction of ensembles are also explored with our proposed ensemble showing great adpativity to new test data stream for cross-database evaluation.

30|$|Today polymer {{flooding}} in a reservoir with high temperature and high salt content {{is an important}} challenge for this industry (Han et al. 2013). Detecting salt-tolerant and thermally stable, polymers with high efficiency and low adsorption on rock surface is <b>a</b> main <b>step</b> <b>to</b> the <b>success</b> of polymer {{flooding in}} HTHS reservoirs (Zhu et al. 2014). To solve this problem, Sulfonated polymers have also been tested by several investigators using core flooding experiments for a temperature up to 100  °C and the results showed promising oil recovery (Hashmet et al. 2017). Therefore, using modified polymer from HPAM can be stable in HTHS condition (Wu et al. 2012). Today many types of synthetic and biopolymer polymer are designed for polymer flooding in HTHS condition. Wang et al. (2011), developed a new Thermoviscosifying polymers (TVP) mainly based on thermosensitive poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) and polyethylene (PEO). Vermolen et al. (2011), used HPAM base Co- and Ter-polymer functionalize with 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropane sulfonate (AMPS) and n-vinyl pyrollidone (n-VP) monomer for polymer flooding in HTHS condition in Middle Eastern carbonate reservoir. The AMPS group provides thermal stability and n-VP group provides resistance to salt. Wang et al. (2012), synthesized a new co-polymer appropriate for polymer flooding. This polymer was produced from mixing of hydrophobic monomer N-dodecyl acrylamide, acrylamide, and polar monomer 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonic acid via micellar polymerization in water. That co-polymer was stable for 30  days in 85  °C and 32, 000  ppm salinity. Zhu et al. (2014), applied the aqueous hybrids of silica nanoparticles and polyacrylamide for HTHS condition. It showed the addition of silica nanoparticles, increase the apparent viscosity and elastic modulus of HPAM solutions. Quadri et al. (2015), experimented polymer flooding process on carbonate core using the biopolymer schizophyllan. The Schizophyllan is used in Asia as medicinal to strengthen {{the immune system and}} in South America, is used as a food supplement. Otherwise, the experimental results showed it has excellent viscosity and high tolerance toward to HTHS condition. Sarsenbekuly et al. (2017) investigated the effect of salt and temperature on the stability of a hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide-based (PAM-based) novel functional polymer (RH- 4). Stability of this polymer by increasing salinity and temperature showed it can be used for EOR.|$|R
