5|$|As {{a student}} athlete at the University of Michigan, Howard volunteered to visit {{patients}} at the University of Michigan Health System Hospitals in Ann Arbor, Michigan. While juggling professional basketball duties and coursework as an NBA rookie/student-athlete, he continued to find time for charity work and hospital visits. His humanitarian works included <b>a</b> <b>Stay</b> <b>in</b> School Jam for 6,500 local area students that he participated in along with several teammates and R artist Usher.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a bout of}} {{tuberculosis}} that required <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> a sanatorium in Switzerland, Szigeti settled in Geneva, where he became Professor of Violin at the local conservatory in 1917. It was in Geneva that he met his future wife, Wanda Ostrowska, and {{at roughly the same}} time he became friends with the composer Béla Bartók. Both relationships were to be lifelong.|$|E
5|$|Variations on the Johns Hopkins {{protocol}} are common. The initiation can {{be performed}} using outpatient clinics rather than requiring <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> hospital. Often there is no initial fast (fasting {{increases the risk of}} acidosis and hypoglycaemia and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, the Pierces {{remained}} in Washington {{for more than}} two months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tenth century, the East Anglian Danes came under {{increasing}} pressure from Edward the Elder, king of Wessex. In 902 Edward's cousin Æthelwold ætheling, {{who had been}} driven into exile after an unsuccessful bid for the throne, arrived in Essex after <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Northumbria. He was apparently accepted as king by {{some or all of}} the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to wage war on Edward. This ended in disaster, with the death of Æthelwold and of Eohric of East Anglia in a battle in the Fens.|$|E
5|$|James Abbott McNeill Whistler {{was born}} in the United States in 1834, the son of George Washington Whistler, a railway engineer. In 1843, his father {{relocated}} the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting. After <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851. In 1855, he made his way back to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. He settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life. There he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti {{and other members of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who would have a profound influence on Whistler.|$|E

5|$|Michael {{was born}} under {{the family name}} of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who {{mentioned}} on the portrait the words aetatis XLIII ("in the 43rd year of life"), which indicates 1558 as the year of Michael's birth. Very {{little is known about}} his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun, (Pătrașcu the Good) of the Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent in order to justify his rule. His mother was Theodora Kantakouzene, a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the country, {{to the delight of}} the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as an officer in the Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Haarlem by the Flemish {{master of}} peasant tavern scenes Adriaen Brouwer, from 1625 or 1626, gave Adriaen van Ostade his lifelong subject, though he often {{took a more}} sentimental approach.

25|$|A {{new road}} from Katoomba, via , offered {{a more direct}} route, with {{travelers}} alighting at Mount Victoria railway station. The horse-drawn coach cost 30 shillings one way or 40 shillings return; meaning that {{a visit to the}} caves and <b>a</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Caves House was still out of the economic reach of the ordinary person. In February 1895 Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg stayed the night at Jenolan Caves House and inspected the caves.|$|E

The move almost certainly aided Wolfgang's musical development; the great majority of his most celebrated works were composed in Vienna.|$|E
