40|$|Background: Photodermatitis is an {{abnormal}} response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The photoallergic contact dermatitis caused by plant allergens {{is a serious}} cause of morbidity in India. Airborne contact dermatitis is the classical presentation of plant-induced dermatosis, which may become difficult to differentiate from chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in chronic cases. The rapid growth of parthenium weed in India and its ill effects on the population make it important to detect all cases of parthenium sensitivity, which in some cases might simulate photodermatitis. Aims: This study aims to detect the occurrence of plant sensitivity and photosensitivity in idiopathic-acquired photodermatoses, airborne contact dermatitis and general population taken as controls. Methods: One hundred and fifty six consecutive patients suffering from polymorphic light eruption (PMLE), chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (CAD) and airborne contact dermatitis (ABCD) {{were enrolled in the}} study over a period of three years (June 2004 to May 2007). An equal number of age and sex matched healthy subjects were enrolled in the study as controls. All the patients were subjected to detailed history taking, clinical examination and histopathological examination for diagnosis. Patch and photopatch testing were perfomed in all the patients and healthy controls for detection of allergic and photoallergic reactions to parthenium, xanthium and chrysanthemum plant antigens and control antigens. Results: Out of 156 patients enrolled in the study, 78 (50 &#x 0025;) had CAD, 67 (42. 9 &#x 0025;) had PMLE and 11 (7. 05 &#x 0025;) had ABCD. The occurrence of parthenium/xanthium allergy and photoallergy, either to parthenium or both was most commonly found in ABCD (72. 7 &#x 0025;), followed by CAD (32 &#x 0025;). In PMLE 4. 5 &#x 0025; cases showed photoallergy. Only 1. 9 &#x 0025; in the control group showed sensitivity to parthenium and xanthium. Conclusion: This study indicates that parthenium (and possibly xanthium) may act as important environmental factors in the initiation and perpetuation of not only ABCD but of CAD as well. Photoexacerbation to UVA at positive parthenium/xanthium sensitivity sites in ABCD and CAD indicates that ABCD with photosensitivity to compositae can lead to CAD...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{treatment}} of chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (CAD), a sun-induced disorder {{characterized by a}} persistent eczematous eruption, involves photoprotective measures, topical corticosteroid therapy and, in more severe cases, systemic immunosuppression. The potential side effects of systemic immunosuppressant drugs prompted us to evaluate the efficacy of topical tacrolimus for {{treatment of}} CAD. Patient and treatment: A 58 -year-old man with CAD, resistant to previous treatment with topical and systemic corticosteroids, oral cyclosporine and PUVA-photochemotherapy, was treated with tacrolimus ointment 0. 1 % once a day. Results: Tacrolimus ointment led to significant improvement of pruritus and severe eczematous skin lesions after 20 days of treatment. Conclusions: Tacrolimus shows a beneficial effect on CAD; this {{could be attributed to}} the fact that CAD is characterized by a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate producing a chronic eczema and that tacrolimus blocks the activation of lymphocytes and other immune system cells, also inhibiting the release of mediators from cutaneous mast cells and basophils...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} a few reports in the {{literature}} of chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (CAD) associated with HIV infection, mostly in African–Americans of skin type VI, where photosensitivity predated the diagnosis of HIV infection.

All had CD 4 cell counts less than 100 cells/microL, with no evidence of AIDS-related complex. They were treated conservatively with photoprotection and topical steroids with mild to moderate improvement. A comparison with nine previously reported cases is made. The pathogenesis of CAD is unclear, but predominance of CD 8 cells in severe cases and reversal of the CD 4 :CD 8 ratio in lesional skin and peripheral blood of HIV-negative CAD patients has been observed.

40|$|Chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (CAD), a {{photosensitive}} dermatosis, {{is characterized}} by inflammatory lesions, especially on sun-exposed skin. However, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, second-generation RNA sequencing and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were performed to determine the transcriptome profiles of patients with CAD. A total 6889 annotated lncRNAs, 341 novel lncRNAs, and 65091 mRNAs were identified. Interestingly, patients with CAD and healthy controls showed distinct transcriptome profiles. Indeed, 198 annotated (81. 48 %) and 45 novel (18. 52 %) lncRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups. GO, KEGG, and RGSEA analyses of lncRNAs showed that inflammatory and immune response related pathways played crucial roles in the pathogenetic mechanism of CAD. In addition, we unveiled key differentially expressed lncRNAs, including lncRNA RP 11 - 356 I 2. 4 which plays a role probably by regulating TNFAIP 3 and inflammation. qRT-PCR data validated the differentially expressed genes. The newly identified lncRNAs may have potential roles {{in the development of}} CAD; these findings lay a solid foundation for subsequent functional exploration of lncRNAs and mRNAs as therapeutic targets for CAD...|$|E
40|$|Background: The contact {{allergic}} reactions from p-phenylenediamine (PPD) in hair dyes vary from mild contact dermatitis to severe life- threatening events (angioedema, bronchospasm, asthma, renal impairment). Objectives: To study the clinical patterns and PPD contact sensitivity {{in patients with}} hair-dye dermatitis. Materials and Methods: Eighty (M: F 47 : 33) consecutive patients aged between 18 and 74 years suspected to have contact allergy from hair dye were studied by patch testing with Indian Standard Series including p-phenylenediamine (PPD, 1. 0 % pet). Results: 54 Fifty-four (M: F 21 : 33) patients showed positive patch tests from PPD. Eight of these patients also showed positive patch test reaction from fragrance mix, thiuram mix, paraben mix, or colophony. Fifty-seven (71 %) patients affected were aged older than 40 years. The duration of dermatitis varied from 1 year with exacerbation following hair coloring. Forty-nine patients had dermatitis of scalp and/or scalp margins and 23 patients had face and neck dermatitis. Periorbital dermatitis, chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and erythema multiforme-like lesions were seen in 4, 2, and 1 patients, respectively.

40|$|Actinic reticuloid (AR) {{or chronic}} <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is {{considered}} a sunlight-induced pseudolymphoma (PSL) on light exposed areas of the skin, which primarily affects elderly males. The disease is a severe, chronic photosensitive dermatosis, first described by Ive et al. in 1969. PSL {{is a group of}} non-cancerous lymphocytic skin disorders that simulate malignant lymphomas, but the changes usually spontaneously regress. The clinical appearance of Actinic reticuloid is variable, usually characterized by an eczematous, pruritic eruption, predominantly present on the head and neck, or other sun exposed areas, but can involve any area of the body. Thereby, crucial characteristic is photosensitivity, whereat action spectrum involves UVB, UVA and visible light beyond 400 nm. The disease {{is considered a}}s PSL which histologically resembles lymphoma with immunohistochemical analysis of the cutaneous infiltrate revealing presence of activated T cells, numerous histiocytes, macrophages and B cells. Moreover, the development of malignant (non-cutaneous) T cell lymphoma in the course of AR has been reported. As the disease has chronic character, it requires significant changes in the patient´s lifestyle and avoidance of provoking factors such as contact allergens or sources of intense light. Thus AR should be considered in every patient who presents with persistent, unclear, erythematous skin changes on the face and neck that are related to sun exposure...|$|E

Patch tests were positive to isoeugenolo 1 % and photo-patch tests showed a positivity to phenotiazine 2 %. After a short and ineffective treatment with beta-carotene and photo-protectors, the clinical picture was resolved with the administration of oral steroids but with a relapse of the dermatitis once the dosage was lowered. We therefore started treatment with cyclosporine-A (4. 5 mg/kg/die), which resulted in a rapid improvement of the clinical picture, but with a reappearance of the manifestations when the dosage was lowered. The treatment was resumed and we observed that the dose of 1. 5 /mg/kg/die resulted morbus-static. The patient is still being treated with this drug at this dosage. The result is that the disease is under control and no side effects are present.

Objective: The {{aim of this}} report is to show the spectrum of presentations of patients with CAD and to outline the proper diagnostic workup of these individuals. Methods: Phototesting was performed to determine the minimal erythema doses to ultraviolet (UV) A (315 – 400 nm) and UVB (280 – 315 nm) and photopatch testing and patch testing for each individual with the North American Contact Dermatitis Group Standard series and the Chemotechnique Plant series, supplemented by the Hausen Plant series and the patients ’ own products. Results: All patients were men, over 45 years, who worked outdoors or had outdoor hobbies. Two had a past known history of allergic contact dermatitis. Two had atopic dermatitis. Three had positive reactions to Compositae plants and sesquiterpene lactone; one had a reaction to lichen acid mix. All had photocontact dermatitis or contact dermatitis to sunscreen chemicals, including benzophenone 3 (oxybenzone), butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (avobenzone), and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (octinoxate).

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} evidence {{regarding the}} effectiveness, efficacy, {{and safety of}} off-label azathioprine use in dermatology. Data Sources: We searched the MEDLINE (1950 - 2009), EMBASE (1980 - 2009), and CENTRAL (1996 - 2009) databases on October 9, 2009. The main search terms were azathioprine and its synonyms. No restrictions were imposed regarding publication date. Only articles in English, French, German, or Dutch were included. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials, cohorts, and case series concerning the use of azathioprine in an off-label dermatologic setting were independently assessed for eligibility by 2 coauthors. The search retrieved 3870 articles, and 148 articles were selected for detailed review. Data Extraction: Forty-three articles matching the inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed for methodologic quality by 2 reviewers independently, including an evaluation of components associated with biased estimates of treatment effect. Data Synthesis: High-quality evidence (level A) was found for a moderate therapeutic effect in severe atopic dermatitis. Evidence of moderate quality (level B) was found for efficacy in parthenium dermatitis (an airborne plant allergen contact dermatitis), bullous pemphigoid, chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and leprosy type 1 reaction. Furthermore, favorable therapeutic effects existed for erythema multiforme, lichen planus, and pityriasis rubra pilaris, although the quality of evidence was low (level C).

40|$|Introduction: Radiotherapy has {{a pivotal}} role in the fight against cancer. However 85 % of patients, who undergo radiotherapy, will face {{moderate}} to severe skin reactions, for the treatment of which various local products, available in the market, are used. Aim: The aim of this systematic literature review was to investigate the prevention and treatment of these skin lesions induced by radiation. Methods: For this purpose 34 articles were collected concerning materials, approved by the FDA, for the prevention and treatment of skin damage due to radiation, preclinical factors tested in animal models, factors involved in the prevention and treatment of moist desquamation and unauthorized agents or with little information about them. Results: According to the study results, the moisturizing and hydrophilic creams, herbal preparations, gels based on hyaluronic acid, and Vitamin E, heparinoid creams and formulations based on oils appear to have a positive effect in preventing dermatitis as well as in providing symptom relief. Patches are suitable for the case of moist desquamation. Vasculotide, agent EUK- 207, agent RTA 408, agent ALDH 2 and the agent Celecoxib are still in the preclinical stage but may become future therapeutic targets. Conclusion: Skin reactions due to radiation remain a significant problem for patients undergoing radical treatment. However, thanks to the multitude of formulations available in the market and several clinical trials it is possible that early prevention and treatment for <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> could be achieved. In conclusion, it is crucial that health professionals are aware of the formulations indicated and contraindicated in case of skin reactions induced by radiation and adjust the treatment for the prevention and management of skin reactions in patients receiving radiation therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background : Low humidity, {{high-velocity}} wind, excessive ultraviolet (UV) exposure, {{and extreme}} cold temperature {{are the main}} causes of various types of environmental dermatoses in high altitudes. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study {{was carried out in}} patients visiting the lone dermatology department in Ladakh between July 2009 and June 2010. The aim was to identify the common environmental dermatoses in high altitudes {{so that they can be}} treated easily or prevented. The patients were divided into three demographic groups, namely, lowlanders, Ladakhis (native highlanders), and tourists. Data was analyzed in a tabulated fashion. Results: A total of 1, 567 patients with skin ailments were seen, of whom 965 were lowlanders, 512 native Ladakhis, and 90 were tourists. The skin disorders due to UV rays, dry skin, and papular urticaria were common among all groups. The frequency of melasma (n = 42; 49. 4 %), chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (CAD) (n = 18; 81. 81 % of total CAD cases), and actinic cheilitis (n = 3; 100 %) was much higher among the native Ladakhis.

40|$|Background Idiopathic photodermatoses are {{considered}} to be common disorders in the population of northern latitude countries, presumably because of the dominance of more "sun-sensitive" individuals with a light-skinned complexion. The incidence of these disorders in the Mediterranean or tropical countries is often under-appreciated because of the higher degree of perennial presence of sunlight and the prevalence of darker skin-type individuals who are seemingly more resistant to the development of sun sensitivity. Methods We performed a retrospective, chart-based review of all patients who were diagnosed with idiopathic photodermatoses at a photodermatology referral center in Athens, Greece, during a period of 10 years. Our aim was to assess the pattern of idiopathic photosensitivity disorders in a Mediterranean country and to determine their epidemiological, clinical, and photobiological profile. Results A total of 310 patients were referred to our center with symptoms of photosensitivity. One hundred and forty-six patients (47. 0 %) were diagnosed with an idiopathic photosensitivity disorder by means of history, clinical examination, biochemical screening, histology, and phototesting. The most prevalent disorder was polymorphous light eruption, which was diagnosed in 95 patients (65. 0 %) of our cohort. Chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> occurred in 15 patients (10. 2 %), solar urticaria in 26 patients (17. 8 %), actinic prurigo in three patients (2. 0 %), hydroa vacciniforme in one patient (0. 6 %) and juvenile spring eruption in six patients (4. 1 %). Conclusions Compared with the results of other studies, the prevalence of idiopathic photodermatoses appears to have a similar trend to that of higher latitude countries. Distinct features in our series include the higher incidence of idiopathic photosensitivity in patients with a fair-skinned complexion (skin types II-III) and the frequent appearance of photo-induced eruptions during sunny weather breaks in the winter period...|$|E
40|$|From 2001 to 2005, {{work was}} {{conducted}} at the Photobiology Unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee to examine the optical radiation environment {{and its implications for}} normal and diseased skin. Artificial sources of radiation were considered within the contexts of the hazards posed, measurement of the hazards, regulation concerning exposure and sources, and protection of abnormal skin from adversee ffects. The hazards posed by both ultraviolet (UV) and visible polychromatic sources were examined for normal and abnormal (chronic <b>actinic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and solar urticaria) skin in an effort to predict the responses to such radiation. With current methodologiesi t was shown that responsesto polychromatic light cannot be forecast for normal and abnormal skin. Those hazards posed by light sources in the commercial sector are also considered. The sunbeds available in Perthshire and Dundee were evaluated spectroradiometrically and appropriate weighting functions applied. A case of adverse effects due to inappropriate use of an UV source is also presented and the implications are discussed. Two diode array spectroradiometers were evaluated for their potential as instruments to measure UV sources. It was shown that one instrument could be used to give measurementsw ith acceptablee rrors. However, later work with a different instrument of the same series showed that there are manufacturing issues to be resolved before these instruments are marketed for widespread use in dosimetry. Regulations governing exposure to and use of sources are considered where appropriate. Licensing of commercial sunbed parlours is suggested in order to enforce Health and Safety guidelines and the British Standard for such appliances, create a baseline for minimum standards of care within the commercial sector and safeguard public health. Lastly, {{it has been shown that}} skin sensitive to visible light can be protected with commercial makeup preparations.
