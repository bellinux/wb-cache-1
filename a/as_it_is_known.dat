5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E

At the northern and southern extremes of its range, it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by El Niño. There is a record of this ray from off British Columbia, which is unconfirmed and would be highly anomalous <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to be a tropical and warm-temperate species.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration as soon <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{with the}} era of the romantic ballet at an end, the {{principal}} personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today.|$|E

5|$|During the Tudor and Stuart periods, horse {{ownership}} {{was more}} widespread in Britain than in continental Europe, but it suffered {{a decline in}} the harsh economic environment of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With economic recovery, the number of horse owners increased again. Travel became more popular, along with the hiring of horses, although a common practice at the time was for a traveller to buy a horse for a journey, and then sell it on arrival at his destination. Horses had been raced in Britain for hundreds of years by the time of King James VI of Scotland (1567– 1625), but he brought the sport <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today into England from Scotland while he was king of both countries (1603– 1625); he organised public races in a number of places, and continued to import quality animals aimed at the development of a new, lighter, faster type of horse.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts claim {{descent from}} the horses {{painted on the}} cave walls of Lascaux, though {{this has not been}} {{verified}} by scientific studies. Horses have been recorded in the area since at least the 10th century, and the regional type was preferred by magistrates and clergy in medieval times. The Poitevin breed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today began to take shape in the early 17th century, as engineers began draining the French marshes and brought with them their draft horses, which were crossed with native horses. Since early in its history, the Poitevin has been used extensively for the breeding of mules, and although commonly called a draft horse, was not favored for agricultural purposes. During the 19th century, the population of the Poitevin increased, reaching 50,000 pure and crossbred mares by 1867. Crossbreeding with other draft breeds led to concerns about the purity of the Poitevin population, but a small group of breeders worked to preserve the remaining purebred population.|$|E

5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E

Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or Earth-616 <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> in dialogue, the story depicts major changes to the space-time continuum {{as a result of}} the time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing the coming of the mainstream Marvel Galactus, an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today.|$|E

5|$|The Thoroughbred <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> {{today was}} {{developed}} in 17th- and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th century and 18th century and to {{a larger number of}} foundation mares of mostly English breeding. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, and around 100,000foals are registered each year worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} the Arabian {{peninsula}} known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, approximately 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E
5|$|After moving between grounds, {{the team}} {{moved to the}} Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which {{remained}} its home ground for 11 years. After this period, the club moved for {{one year to the}} Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000spectators. After that, Real Madrid moved its home matches to Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United. In this stadium, which hosted 22,500spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title. After some successes, the 1943 elected president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Estadio Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and was inaugurated on 14 December 1947. This was the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> today, although it did not acquire the present name until 1955. The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Real Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses and won by Los Blancos, 3–1, the first goal being scored by Sabino Barinaga.|$|E
