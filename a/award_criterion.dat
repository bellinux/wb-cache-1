50|$|The National Recognition Medal for Victims of Terrorism (Médaille {{nationale}} de reconnaissance aux victimes du terrorisme) is {{a national}} medal of France awarded to French victims of terrorism. Established by presidential decree on July 12, 2016, it may be awarded to French or foreign nationals who are victims of terrorism in France or abroad. The medal may be awarded to a retroactive date of January 1, 2006. The medal was created to give a proper recognition to the sacrifice of terrorism victims while still maintaining the <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> of existing national honors such as the Legion of Honor. In Spain there is a similar honor known as the Royal Order of Civil Recognition for Victims of Terrorism.|$|E
5000|$|The Combat Medical Badge is {{an award}} of the United States Army which was first created in January 1945. Any {{member of the}} Army Medical Department, at the rank of colonel or below, who is {{assigned}} or attached to a ground combat arms unit of brigade or smaller size which provides medical support during any {{period in which the}} unit was engaged in ground combat is eligible for the CMB. According to the <b>award</b> <b>criterion,</b> the individual must be performing medical duties while simultaneously being engaged by the enemy; strict adherence to this requirement and its interpretation (e.g., distant mortar rounds vs. direct small arms fire) will vary by unit. As of 3 June 2005, Special Forces medics are no longer eligible for award, but may now receive the Combat Infantryman Badge. A revision has allowed aviation medics to be eligible for the CMB. [...] The non-combat proficiency equivalent is the Expert Field Medical Badge.|$|E
40|$|Public Awarding Authorities {{around the}} world aim at {{procuring}} construction contracts that will achieve project completion within predefined cost, time and quality constraints. Nowadays, national and supranational public works programmes define strict completion dates at the client's risk of losing funding if deadlines are not met. The choice of procurement method is therefore of utmost importance. In most cases, the client's award is based on financial offers only. As the construction time for project completion within funding programme targets is extremely important, {{it should also be}} considered as an <b>award</b> <b>criterion.</b> In this paper, the most common award methods are evaluated and a new one is proposed. The <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> considered is the most economically advantageous tender as defined in the European Union Legislation and takes into account the construction cost and completion time. The evaluation of both financial and time offers is carried out by implementing utility theory. An illustrative example is provided. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{competition}} {{to acquire the}} exclusive right to operate an infrastructure service, by comparing two different specifications for the financial proposals - "lowest price to consumers" vs "highest concession fee", and two alternative contractual arrangements: a contract which imposes the obligation to immediately undertake the investment required to operate the concessioned service and a contract which simply assigns to the winning bidder the right to supply the market at a date of her choosing. By comparing the returns of these alternative award criteria and concessioning conditions, we show that concessioning without imposing rollout time limits {{may or may not}} provide a higher expected social value, depending on the bidding rule used to allocate the contract.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of the development of public procurement (PP) rules in the EU and in selected international organisations. The EU rules were originally designed to foster competition and efficiency, and the dominant <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> was the price. Over time, and in particular {{in the context of the}} "EU 2020 " strategy, PP rules have been extended to address not only economic objectives, but also social and environmental goals as well as innovation aspects. As a result, such "strategic" elements of PP have in 2014 been legalised by the new EU Procurement Directives. However, as long as strategic PP remains an isolated policy, it will have only limited ramifications on Community-wide sustainability. Strategic PP should rather complement sustainability policies in their respective areas and should thus become an integral part of overall EU policies...|$|E
40|$|The public {{procurement}} of defence materiel was previously regulated in Directive 2004 / 18 /EC {{but due to}} the special character of the defence market, a new Directive has been issued; Directive 2009 / 81 /EC. The purpose of this Directive is to be better suited for the special features of the defence market. Directive 2009 / 81 /EC will now regulate most of the contracts that, due to their sensitive and secret character, were earlier exempted from {{the rules of the}} Treaties on the basis of Article 346 TFEU and from Directive 2004 / 18 /EC {{on the basis of its}} Article 14. It is, however, still possible to exempt some contracts on the basis of these Articles. Directive 2009 / 81 /EC regulates the procedure for contract awarding and affects the possibilities of the Member State to choose a tender with Offset agreement over one without and thereforethe Directive affects the offering company as well. Earlier a company has been free to shape its contracts concerning {{public procurement}} of defence material with little regard to the regulations of the Internal Market. With the implementation of the new directive, the situation has become uncertain. In particular the state of law concerningOffset agreements, commonly offered as a part of a tender in contracts concerning defenceprocurement, has become uncertain. This as Offset is not explicitly mentioned in Directive 2009 / 81 /EC but several bodies of the European Union have expressed opinions regarding the legality of Offset and whether or not it is a discriminating measure. We have found that Offset agreements, both related and un-related to the subject matter of the contract, can be exempted on the basis of Article 346 TFEU if they support essential security interest. However, that the procurement concerns the defence sector is not enough for contracts to be exempted if these contracts only support other interests, e. g. industrial or economical, rather than those of essential security. This as the exemption of these contracts would have adistorting effect on the trade on other markets than the one related to defence procurement. Even though Offset is not mentioned as a criterion for awarding of contracts in Article 47. 1 (a) Directive 2009 / 81 /EC, this does not exclude the possibility that it could be. If Offset is to be used as an <b>award</b> <b>criterion,</b> it cannot be of significant weight when determining the economically most advantageous tender and can in no case be discriminating. Also, a differencebetween direct and indirect Offset must be made since indirect Offset agreements do not fulfill the requirements, in 47. 1 (a) Directive 2009 / 81 /EC, in order to be considered asan <b>award</b> <b>criterion.</b> It is therefore only possible to use direct Offset agreements as an <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> according to Directive 2009 / 81 /EC if this is done in a non-discriminating way...|$|E

40|$|Private sector buyers often award {{construction}} contracts through negotiation {{rather than through}} open competitive tendering. Negotiating with a reputable contractor {{is a way to}} mitigate contractual hazards. For many public sector buyers, however, open competitive tendering is required by law. The practices of procurement officers in local authorities are examined in regard to the selection of construction contractors, focusing particularly on their use of scoring-based competitive tendering and ex ante information exchange between procurement officers and the firms competing for contracts. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 15 procurement officers in 10 local authorities in Sweden. Using the contractor's staffing of the project organization as a contract <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> allows procurement officers to select reputable contractors. Arranging face-to-face meetings with contractors before the final award decision allows procurement officers to resolve at least some technical problems in complex construction projects. When negotiations are prohibited by law, these practices can be seen as combined responses to hazards of construction contracting. Contracting, procurement law, public sector, Sweden,...|$|E

Several municipalities in the Helsinki region together with the Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority and several expert organizations initiated an EU Life project, JULIA 2030, to develop calculators for different sectors in municipalities. Our subproject deals with the procurement of products, and we developed carbon footprint calculators for six product groups: office and tissue paper, laptop computers, office seating solutions, incontinence products, and outdoor lighting products. The developed calculators are intended for use in tender calls, as attachments that the bidders must deliver together with their bid.

40|$|The <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> ‘Most Economically Advantageous Tender’ (MEAT) is {{increasingly}} applied to award tender contracts in the Dutch infrastructural sector. Because of this, contractors are requested to develop solutions themselves instead of executing fully specified works. Therefore, new opportunities arise to become competitive. This research explores opportunities {{to increase the}} competitiveness of BAM Infra, a major Dutch constructor. Among other things, they aim to distinguish at MEAT tenders {{on the field of}} sustainability. Based upon literature addressing competitiveness in the construction sector, insights into competitive factors are derived from two strategic theories – competitive positioning theory and resource-based view – and organizational learning. In addition, these factors are supplemented with empirical findings. By means of semi-structured interviews BAM Infra’s status on competitive factors has been analyzed resulting in improvement opportunities. Based hereupon, recommendations are formulated to increase competitiveness by distinguishing more at tenders, to shape conditions that enable increased competitiveness and to improve actual processes at projects.

40|$|AbstractAround the world, clients procure {{construction}} contracts aiming at project completion within predefined cost, time and quality constraints. In parallel, {{it is critical}} {{in the public sector}} to achieve the contract award as objectively as possible. In most cases, the public clients’ award is based on the lower price only; in the contracts, penalties are foreseen for time deadlines violation and quality control bad results. In the European Union legislation, the most economically advantageous tender is also considered as an <b>award</b> <b>criterion,</b> encompassing in fact many sub-criteria. The pros and cons of both approaches have extensively been discussed in the literature. Therefore, the choice of a procurement method that will combine the merits of both approaches to the wider possible extent is of utmost importance. In this paper, a new award method based on the most economically advantageous tender is proposed. The sub-criteria considered are construction cost, completion time and warranty offered by each bidder. Their objective evaluation is carried out by implementing utility theory.

40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to examine what the {{differences}} are between the Classic directive (directive 2004 / 18 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts) and the Revised Classic directive (directive 2014 / 24 /EU of the European Parliament and of the council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004 / 18 /EC) when it comes to social considerations in public procurement. The second aim is to examine if the revision of the directive has solved the prior existing problems regarding social considerations in public procurement. In this paper a traditional European legal method is used. The examinations show a number of things, including the Revised Classic directive involving codification of case law, references to other sources of law and some clarified rules as well as new provisions. The regulations regarding reserved contracts, technical specifications, and selection criterion are satisfied in the Revised Classic directive. Certain changes and clarifications are still required in regards to the regulations of exclusions grounds, contract <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> and abnormally low tenders. The facet of the directive which requires the most significant clarification is regarding the conditions for performance of contracts.     Keywords: public procurement, social considerations, socially responsible public procuremen...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the use of bid information, {{including}} both price and non-price factors in predicting the bidder’s performance. Design/methodology/approach – The practice of the industry was first reviewed. Data on bid evaluation and performance records of the successful bids were then obtained from the Hong Kong Housing Department, the largest housing provider in Hong Kong. This was followed by the development of a radial basis function (RBF) neural network based performance prediction model. Findings – It is found that public clients are more conscientious and include non-price factors in their bid evaluation equations. With the input variables used the information is available at the time of the bid and the output variable is the project performance score recorded during work in progress achieved by the successful bidder. It was found that past project performance score is the most sensitive input variable in predicting future performance. Research limitations/implications – The paper shows the inadequacy of using price alone for bid <b>award</b> <b>criterion.</b> The need for a systemic performance evaluation is also highlighted, as this information is highly instrumental for subsequent bid evaluations. The caveat for this study is that the prediction model was developed based on data obtained from one single source. Originality/value – The value of the paper is in the use of an RBF neural network as the prediction tool because it can model non-linear function. This capability avoids tedious ‘‘trial and error’’ in deciding the number of hidden layers to be used in the network model.
