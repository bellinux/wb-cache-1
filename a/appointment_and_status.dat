5000|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} the way power is expressed through work time is scheduling. As Yakura and others have noted in research shared by Ballard and Seibold, [...] "scheduling reflects {{the extent to which}} the sequencing and duration of plans activities and events are formalized" [...] (Ballard and Seibold, p. 6). Higher-status individuals have very precise and formal schedules - indicating that their stature requires that they have specific blocks of time for specific meetings, projects <b>and</b> <b>appointments.</b> Lower <b>status</b> individuals however, may have less formalized schedules. Finally, the schedule <b>and</b> <b>appointment</b> calendar of the higher status individual will take precedence in determining where, when and the importance of a specific event or appointment.|$|R
40|$|Undetectable {{anticonvulsant}} {{blood levels}} indicate sustained noncompliance (several consecutive doses missed). We com-pared 91 consecutive outpatients with epilepsy and undetectable anticonvulsant blood levels to 100 patients seen {{during the same}} time period, verified as compliant by acceptable serum levels. We hypothesized that pay status, application for Supplemental Security Income, patient age, history of missed <b>appointments,</b> <b>and</b> functional <b>status</b> would differ between compliant and noncompliant patients. We were surprised to find large differences between clinic and insurance patients and between Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients. The 100 compliant patients included 44 Caucasian and 56 non-Caucasian patients, whereas only 9 of 91 noncompliant patients were Caucasian, and only 9 had insurance, compared to 32 compliant patients. Applications for Supplemental Security Income and history of missed appointments were signifi-cantly associated with noncompliance, but patient age, seizure type, and seizure control were not. Uninsured Caucasians were more often compliant than non-Caucasians were. Many noncompliant patients had mild epilepsy, which was report-edly doing well. Race <b>and</b> pay <b>status</b> were closely correlated. Several noncompliant females became pregnant, whereas no compliant patients did. Compliant patients {{were much more likely to}} be accompanied by a parent or caretaker on clinic visits than noncompliant patients. Noncompliant patients had at least one acceptable subsequent serum level, although 2 patients with intractable epilepsy had undetectable serum levels on three or more occasions. Noncompliance may respon...|$|R
40|$|The names, specialties, <b>and</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>status</b> of {{physicians}} with privileges in 161 North Carolina hospitals were obtained and {{compared to the}} file of licensed, active, patient-care physicians practicing in the State for the year 1978. The listings were examined {{to determine the number}} {{of physicians}} without a hospital privilege by age, race, sex, specialty, and geographic location. Overall, only 11 percent of all active physicians did not have some form of hospital <b>appointment.</b> Among family <b>and</b> general practitioners, 29 percent had either a restricted hospital privilege or no hospital appointment at all. A greater number of nonwhite and female physicians were also without privileges. These data have implications for the training of physicians in a system that emphasizes hospital care and includes inpatient treatment within the purview of primary care...|$|R
30|$|Tools {{developed}} for documentation of pharmaceutical care services and for drug inventory control included the pharmacy order form for prescription ordering, pharmaceutical care daily worksheet for daily documentation of pharmaceutical care provided to clients including the screening and documentation of drug therapy {{problems and the}} interventions in the pharmacy; pharmacy daily worksheet for daily documentation of prescription orders filled in the pharmacy; monthly work books, and monthly summary forms, pharmacy <b>appointment</b> diaries, <b>and</b> patient <b>status</b> registers. The National Individual Case Safety Report Form was deployed for reporting of suspected ADRs to the National Pharmacovigilance center, National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). Some IEC materials and job aids provided were dispensing trays, auxiliary medication labels with label key charts, key to grading adverse drug reactions, plain medication labels, pharmacy jackets, and pharmacists’ tags.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{movement}} to introduce a classroom liberal education component into technical courses up to Ordinary National Certificate arose from the rethinking {{of the role of}} education under the influence of psychology and mass democracy after the First World War. The application and institutionalisation of the resulting concepts is traced, through the Spens Report, the 1944 Education Act and subsequent pamphlets, the Crowther Report, and Government White Papers and Pamphlets, together with related City and Guilds and individual developments. The present rationale of the subject, and the courses based on it, are shown to have as objects the enlargement of socio-cultural awareness and the inculcation of desired social attitudes rather that the acquisition of specialist knowledge. In the chosen sample area, North-East England (excluding the North Riding of Yorkshire), the influence of national directives on social studies teaching is shown in some Authorities to have resulted in a coherent liberal education policy, but otherwise to have led only to a series of revisions of technical courses, dependent upon L. E. A. size and wealth, local cultural and educational tradition, and geographical position. Effective teaching at college level is found to depend upon both Individual staff contributions and Local Authority policy, and especially therefore upon <b>appointments</b> <b>and</b> departmental <b>status</b> policy. The effectiveness of this teaching is evaluated by means of tests of cultural span and social attitude, completed by a group of 112 control and 38 % experimental students from five colleges, covering all levels of student and methods of teaching. Results show that social studies teaching is not in itself a significant factor in effective scoring, but enhances other significant factors, by increasing the scores of the better students, in particular, Technicians and O. N. C. students. Social studies teaching itself varies significantly in effectiveness with college, method, and student interest...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} parameter in {{the assessment}} of quality healthcare lies on patient satisfaction. Despite concerted efforts to improve health care services, patient satisfaction couple with the quality of hospital care at disposal remains a significant challenge in Nigeria. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the perception on factors associated with prolonged waiting time and patient satisfaction at the outpatient department of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Specialist Hospital in Nigeria. A mixed method research was utilised. Questionnaire was administered on 95 outpatients along with a focus group discussion (FGD) was held with 8 participants. Statistical analysis was utilized to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. Data from focus group discussion was analysed with NVivo 10. The overall hospital satisfaction was found to be 75. 8 % among the study population. There was a significant inverse relationship between the level of satisfaction with the doctor <b>and</b> (employment <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> educational level) and direct relationship with (<b>appointment</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> type of visits). In FDG, the result shows that patients were satisfied with the neatness of the hospital, doctor’s professionalism and patient-doctor relationship. Dissatisfaction was with extended patient waiting time and the small size infrastructure of the hospital, inefficient handling of patient files by nurse aids and thoroughness of the physicians. The results showed that majority of the patients were dissatisfied with the waiting time for consultation in the hospital. In other words, consultation time positively correlated with the level of patient satisfaction. To improve the overall patient satisfaction the waiting time for consultation should be reduced significantly...|$|R

Using relational screening model, this study aimed at investigating preservice history and social studies teachers’ perceptions of outdoor history teaching in terms of different variables. The participants were composed of 265 preservice teachers studying at two different universities in Turkey during 2016 - 2017 academic year. Outdoor History Teaching Perceptions Scale (OHTPS), which was developed by Yazıcı and Yıldırım (2017) and aimed at determining the teachers’/preservice teachers’ perceptions of outdoor history teaching, {{was used as the}} data collection tool. Within the framework of this study, preservice history and social studies teachers’ perceptions of outdoor history teaching were investigated in terms of gender, university, department, GPA, <b>and</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>status</b> after graduation. As a result of the study, it was found that preservice social studies teachers obtained higher scores from the subscales of outdoor history teaching awareness, knowledge, and competency, and from the complete scale than preservice history teachers...|$|R
