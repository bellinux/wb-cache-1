5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E

5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges.</b> So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

At birth, their life expectancy is 1–2 years, an adult typically can live to be six, with exceptional individuals making it to 12 years.|$|E
