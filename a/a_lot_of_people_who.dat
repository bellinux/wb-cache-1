I have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> love me, but I {{have a lot of}} haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E
25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> didn't come to hear me play.

500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face... there were not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's last match {{before the}} final was against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup, which they won 6–1.

[...] Despite missing the match against Brighton, Dalglish was {{confident}} that Daniel Agger and Craig Bellamy would be fit for the final. Going into the match Liverpool had not won a trophy since they beat West Ham United in the 2006 FA Cup Final. Dalglish stated that victory: [...] "means a lot to me, more importantly {{it means a lot to}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have had to endure a few years when we've not been [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So we started the casting process, and all I saw was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> couldn't play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E

[...] In response, one {{newspaper}} editorial called him a [...] "meat head". Holtmann was chair of the House of Commons Communications and Culture Committee, which oversees the NGC funding; the committee itself was split on the issue. The artist called Holtmann a [...] "self-proclaimed Philistine [...] not even successful as a hog farmer." [...] Art critic Christopher Hume commented that the Committee's concept [...] "was based on the notion that the National Gallery is somehow accountable for poverty and hunger in Canada.

500|$|... "Boys' Club" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. McCullers co-wrote two of the Austin Powers films and directed Poehler in the comedy film Baby Mama. The cold open scene, with kids throwing bags of dog feces at Leslie, {{was added to the}} episode after the rest had already been filmed, and was directed personally by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The bags were actually filled with mashed potatoes. Daniels said of the opening, [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> felt this was not in good taste, but to me, {{this was one of the}} most fun things about the show." [...] The restriction prohibiting Pawnee employees from accepting gifts over $25 was based on real-life municipal regulations the Parks and Recreation producers encountered during their research. The scenes filmed in the town hall outside courtyard were filmed on a studio sound stage, and the ethics board review scene was filmed inside the city hall building of Pasadena, California.|$|E

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} his hopes for fan {{reaction to the}} second season's emphasis on the Kazon, Piller said: [...] "I'll be curious {{to know what the}} audience's perception is, if our investing in the Kazon this season worked." [...] In response to fans' concerns that Voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous Star Trek installments, he believed that the growing focus on the Kazon would serve as the solution. Piller believed the alien species accentuated the show's futuristic storylines, explaining: [...] "There are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> don't consider a lot [...] science fiction." [...] He followed this up by saying: [...] "But certainly you can make a case that facing the Kazon in battle is futurist storytelling." [...] Taylor viewed the second season as focused on [...] "character-driven, introspective" [...] stories, with a majority of the [...] "action-adventure" [...] aspects being conducted through the appearances of the Kazon.|$|E
500|$|... "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" [...] was {{delivered}} on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon University's McConomy Auditorium. Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knew me believe that I did my best to try to live this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with London's Evening Standard in January 2013, Anthony Hopkins (who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock) questioned The Girls portrayal of the director {{and the need for}} a film about that period of Hitchcock's career: [...] "I talked to Tippi Hedren one day...and she never mentioned that...Whatever his obsession was, she didn't want to dwell on it...I don't think it's necessary to put all that into a movie." [...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal {{of a man who was}} a little more complex than that. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> were there, do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers {{want to be in a}} rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Air Force, Rowland {{continued}} to live in Canberra, consulting part-time for French arms concern Ofema. In late 1980 he was recommended {{by the government of}} Premier Neville Wran to serve as the next Governor of New South Wales, replacing Sir Roden Cutler. Rowland admitted {{that he did not have}} [...] "the faintest idea" [...] why he was chosen, and thought that [...] "there must be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could do it a lot better than I could". He saw the role as the monarch's representative in New South Wales as helping to provide [...] "a valuable link with an older part of the world". Wran, for his part, was understood to have chosen Rowland largely on the basis of his engaging personality; it was also said that the Premier preferred military men for vice-regal office because [...] "they knew how to take orders". Rowland was duly appointed by Queen ElizabethII on 20January 1981. Upon taking office, he declared that he wished to be seen as a [...] "man of the people". To this end, he opened Government House to the public on a more frequent basis, and also extended invitations for official functions to a broader range of society than was previously the case.|$|E

500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been. She's recovering." ...|$|E
500|$|Academic {{papers at}} ISMB were {{traditionally}} {{presented in a}} single track. Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on protein secondary structure prediction, sequence analysis and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively. As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks including multiple proceedings tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. Christopher Rawlings (head of Computational and Systems Biology at Rothamsted Research and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{wanted to keep it}} more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t." [...] As the number of submitted proceedings papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012. ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by AAAI Press. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal Bioinformatics. The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.|$|E
