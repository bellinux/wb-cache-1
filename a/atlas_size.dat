50|$|In realtime {{computer}} graphics, a texture atlas (also {{called a}} sprite sheet) {{is an image}} containing a collection of smaller images, usually packed together to reduce the <b>atlas</b> <b>size.</b> Atlases can consist of uniformly-sized sub-images, or they can consist of images of varying dimensions. A sub-image is drawn using custom texture coordinates to pick {{it out of the}} atlas. In an application where many small textures are used frequently, it is often more efficient to store the textures in a texture atlas which is treated as a single unit by the graphics hardware. Careful alignment may be needed to avoid bleeding between sub textures when used with mipmapping and texture compression.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of transcriptional regulatory networks, which control tissue-specific development and function, is of central {{importance to the}} understanding of lymphocyte biology. To decipher transcriptional networks in T-cell development and differentiation we developed a browsable expression atlas and applied a novel quantitative method to define gene sets most specific to each of the represented cell subsets and tissues. Using this system, body <b>atlas</b> <b>size</b> datasets can be used to examine gene enrichment profiles from a cell/tissue perspective rather than gene perspective, thereby identifying highly enriched genes within a cell type, which are often key to cellular differentiation and function. A systems analysis of transcriptional regulators within T cells during different phases of development and differentiation resulted in the {{identification of}} known key regulators and uncharacterized coexpressed regulators. ZBTB 25, a BTB-POZ family transcription factor, was identified as a highly T cell–enriched transcription factor. We provide evidence that ZBTB 25 functions as a negative regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) activation, such that RNA interference mediated knockdown resulted in enhanced activation of target genes. Together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism for NF-AT mediated gene expression and the compendium of expression data provides a quantitative platform to drive exploration of gene expression across a wide range of cell/tissue types...|$|E
40|$|ATLAS {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{experiments}} in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN which has been put in operation this year. The challenging experimental environment and the extreme detector complexity required development of a highly scalable distributed monitoring framework, which is currently being used to monitor the quality of the data being taken as well as operational conditions of the hardware and software elements of the detector, trigger and data acquisition systems. At the moment the ATLAS Trigger/DAQ system is distributed over more than 1000 computers which is about one third of the final <b>ATLAS</b> <b>size.</b> At every minute of an ATLAS data taking session the monitoring framework serves several thousands physics events to monitoring data analysis applications, handles more than 4 million histograms updates coming from more than 4 thousands applications, executes 10 thousands advanced data quality checks for a subset of those histograms, displays histograms and results of these checks on several dozens of monitors installed in main and satellite ATLAS control rooms. This note presents the overview of the online monitoring software framework, and describes the experience which was gained during an extensive commissioning period {{as well as at the}} first phase of LHC beam in September 2008.

In this document two methods of reducing {{the contribution of the}} LAr calorimetry to the overall <b>ATLAS</b> data <b>size</b> are described. The first method simply recognizes that very low energy cells require less space in the record. The second method, called zero suppression, saves space in the LAr data recordby suppressing cells containing electronic and pileup noise. Using these two methods, reductions {{in the size of the}} LAr data record by a factor of approximately five to six can be achieved without obvious impairment of the underlying physics. The data reduction takes place in the RODs. The zero suppression algorithms are constructed to work either in the RODs or in the Event Filter. Information on how to run the zero suppression code are given and a sketch of a possible data format for the LAr data record is given.

40|$|Purpose: To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of atlas-based segmentation without compromising accuracy, and {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the proposed method on MRI-based prostate segmentation application. Methods: Accurate and efficient automatic structure segmentation is an important task in medical image processing. Atlas-based methods, as the state-of-the-art, provide good segmentation at the cost {{of a large number of}} computationally intensive nonrigid registrations, for anatomical sites/structures that are subject to deformation. In this study, the authors propose to utilize a combination of global, regional, and local metrics to improve the accuracy yet significantly reduce the number of required nonrigid registrations. The authors first perform an affine registration to minimize the global mean squared error (gMSE) to coarsely align each atlas image to the target. Subsequently, atarget-specific regional MSE (rMSE), demonstrated to be a good surrogate for dice similarity coefficient (DSC), is used to select a relevant subset from the training atlas. Only within this subset are nonrigid registrations performed between the training images and the target image, to minimize a weighted combination of gMSE and rMSE. Finally, structure labels are propagated from the selected training samples to the target via the estimated deformation fields, and label fusion is performed based on a weighted combination of rMSE and local MSE (lMSE) discrepancy, with proper total-variation-based spatial regularization. Results: The proposed method was applied to a public database of 30 prostate MR images with expert-segmented structures. The authors' method, utilizing only eight nonrigid registrations, achieved a performance with a median/mean DSC of over 0. 87 / 0. 86, outperforming the state-of-the-art full-fledged atlas-based segmentation approach of which the median/mean DSC was 0. 84 / 0. 82 when applying to their data set. Conclusions: The proposed method requires a fixed number of nonrigid registrations, independent of <b>atlas</b> <b>size,</b> providing desirable scalability especially important for a large or growing atlas. When applied to prostate segmentation, the method achieved better performance to the state-of-the-art atlas-based approaches, with significant improvement in computation efficiency. The proposed rationale of utilizing jointly global, regional, and local metrics, based on the information characteristic and surrogate behavior for registration and fusion subtasks, can be extended naturally to similarity metrics beyond MSE, such as correlation or mutual information types. © 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|This Technical Design Report (TDR) for the High-level Trigger (HLT), Data Acquisition (DAQ) and Controls of the ATLAS {{experiment}} {{builds on}} the earlier documents published on these systems: Trigger Performance Status Report, DAQ, EF, LVL 2 and DCS Technical Progress Report, and High-Level Triggers, DAQ and DCS Technical Proposal. Much background and preparatory work relevant to this TDR is referenced in the above documents. In addition, {{a large amount of}} detailed technical documentation has been produced in support of this TDR. These documents are referenced in the appropriate places in the following chapters. This section introduces the overall organization of the document. The following sections give an overview of the principal system requirements and functions, as well as {{a brief description of the}} principal data types used in the Trigger/DAQ (TDAQ) system. The document has been organized into four parts: Part I — Global View Chapters 2, 3 and 4 address the principal system and experiment parameters which define the main requirements of the HLT, DAQ and Controls system. The global system operations, and the physics requirements and event selection strategy are also addressed. Chapter 5 defines the overall architecture of the system and analyses the requirements of its principal components, while Chapters 6 and 7 address more specific fault-tolerance and monitoring issues. Part II — System Components This part describes in more detail the principal components and functions of the system. Chapter 8 addresses the final prototype design and performance of the Data Flow component. These are responsible for the transport of event data from the output of the detector Read Out Links (ROLs) via the HLT system (where event selection takes place) to mass storage. Chapter 9 explains the decomposition of the HLT into a second level trigger (LVL 2) and an Event Filter (EF). It details the design of the data flow within the HLT, the specifics of the HLT system supervision, and the design and implementation of the Event Selection Software (ESS). Chapter 10 addresses the Online Software which is responsible for the run control and DAQ supervision of the entire TDAQ and detector systems during data taking. It is also responsible for miscellaneous services such as error reporting, run parameter accessibility, and histogramming and monitoring support. Chapter 11 describes the Detector Control System (DCS), responsible for the control and supervision of all the detector hardware and of the services and the infrastructure of the experiment. The DCS is also the interface point for information exchange between ATLAS and the LHC accelerator. Chapter 12 draws together the various aspects of experiment control detailed in previous chapters and examines several use-cases for the overall operation and control of the experiment, including: data-taking operations, calibration runs, and operations required outside data-taking. Part III — System Performance Chapter 13 addresses the physics selection. The tools used for physics selection are described along with the event-selection algorithms and their performance. Overall HLT output rates and sizes are also discussed. An initial analysis of how ATLAS will handle the first year of running from the point of view of TDAQ is presented. Chapter 14 discusses the overall performance of the HLT/DAQ system from various points of view, namely the HLT performance as evaluated in dedicated testbeds, the overall performance of the TDAQ system in a testbed of ~ 10 % <b>ATLAS</b> <b>size,</b> and functional tests of the system in the detector test beam environment. Data from these various testbeds are also used to calibrate a detailed discrete-event -simulation model of data flow in the full-scale system. Part IV — Organization and Planning Chapter 15 discusses quality-assurance issues and explains the software-development process employed. Chapter 16 presents the system costing and staging scenario. Chapter 17 presents the overall organization of the project and general system-resource issues. Chapter 18 presents the short-term HLT/DAQ work-plan for the next phase of the project as well as the global development schedule up to LHC turn-on in 2007...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Osteophytes {{are thought}} to {{stabilize}} an osteoarthritic joint, thereby preventing structural progression. Meagre longitudinal data suggest, however, that they are {{associated with an increased}} risk of structural progression. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of osteophyte size on radiographic progression in osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Using data from a natural history study of persons with symptomatic knee OA, we obtained fluoroscopically positioned postero-anterior (PA) radiographs at baseline, 15 and 30 months. Using an <b>atlas,</b> osteophyte <b>size</b> was scored on a scale of 0 – 3 at each of four sites on the PA film and, for each knee, both compartment-specific (i. e. medial; lateral) and overall osteophyte scores were computed. Progression was defined as an increase over follow-up in medial or lateral joint space narrowing, based on a semiquantitative grading. Mechanical alignment was assessed using long limb films at the 15 month examination. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relation of osteophyte size with progression, adjusting for age, gender and body mass index, and with and without adjustment for alignment. Results. Of 270 subjects who had 470 eligible knees with follow-up, 104 (22 %) knees showed progression. Overall, osteophyte score modestly increased the risk of progression [odds ratio (OR) per S. D. increase of osteophyte score 1. 4 (95 % CI 1. 1, 1. 8, P 0. 02) ], but this effect weakened and became non-significant after adjustment for limb alignment (OR 1. 3).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{simulation}} ("computer modeling") of the Trigger/DAQ {{system of the}} ATLAS experiment at the LHC accelerator is discussed. The system will consist of a few thousand end-nodes, which are interconnected by a large Local Area Network. The nodes will run various applications under the Linux OS. The purpose of computer modeling is to verify the rate handling capability of the system designed and to find potential problem areas. The models of the system components are kept {{as simple as possible}} but are sufficiently detailed to reproduce behavioral aspects relevant to the issues studied. Values of the model parameters have been determined using small dedicated setups. This calibration phase has been followed by a validation process. More complex setups have been wired-up and relevant measurement results were obtained. These setups were also modeled and the results were compared to the measurement results. Discrepancies were leading to modification and extension of the set of parameters. After gaining confidence in this way in the system component models a model of the full <b>size</b> <b>ATLAS</b> system was run. Predictions for the latency, throughput and queue development in various places have been obtained.

ANIMALS: 65 CKCSs and 72 dogs of other breeds. PROCEDURES: The amount that the spinous process of the axis overlapped the dorsal arch of the <b>atlas,</b> the relative <b>size</b> of the spinous process of the axis, {{and the amount of}} widening of the atlantoaxial joint that occurred when the neck was moved from a neutral to a flexed position were measured on lateral radiographic projections of the atlantoaxial region.

40|$|While the {{practice}} of construction has a long history, the underlying theory of construction is relatively young. Very little has been documented as to techniques of logistic support, construction planning, construction scheduling, construction testing, and inspection. The lack of 'systems approaches' to construction processes {{is certainly one of}} the most serious roadblocks to the construction of space structures. System engineering research efforts at CSC are aimed at developing concepts and tools which contribute to a systems theory of space construction. The research is also aimed at providing means for trade-offs of design parameters for other research areas in CSC. Systems engineering activity at CSC has divided space construction into the areas of orbital assembly, lunar base construction, interplanetary transport vehicle construction, and Mars base construction. A brief summary of recent results is given. Several models for 'launch-on-time' were developed. Launch-on-time is a critical concept to the assembly of such Earth-orbiting structures as the Space Station Freedom, and to planetary orbiters such as the Mars transfer vehicle. CSC has developed a launch vehicle selection model which uses linear programming to find optimal combinations of launch vehicles of various <b>sizes</b> (<b>Atlas,</b> Titan, Shuttles, HLLV's) to support SEI missions. Recently, the Center developed a cost trade-off model for studying on orbit assembly logistics. With this model it was determined that the most effective size of the HLLV would be in the range of 120 to 200 metric tons to LEO, which is consistent with the choices of General Stafford's Synthesis Group Report. A second-generation Dynamic Construction Activities Model ('DYCAM') process model has been under development, based on our past results in interruptability and our initial DYCAM model. This second-generation model is built on the paradigm of knowledge-based expert systems. It is aimed at providing answers to two questions: (1) what are some necessary or sufficient conditions for judging conceptual designs of spacecraft?, and (2) can a methodology be formulated such that these conditions may be used to provide computer-aided tools for evaluating conceptual designs and planning for space assembly sequences? Early simulation results indicate that the DYCAM model has a clear ability to emulate and simulate human orbital construction processes...|$|R
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire, CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland, is an {{international}} physics project of unprecedented scale. First proton beams were circulated in the LHC in 2008. The ATLAS Collaboration, {{an international}} group of 2000 analysts, scientists, software developers and hardware experts, seeks to push the boundaries of our current understanding of the Universe, and our ability to undertake such studies. A central physics focus of the ATLAS experiment is study of a Higgs boson, a theoretically predicted particle, as yet unobserved in nature. In this thesis, a Neural Network is adopted and developed as an analysis method {{in a study of}} a Standard Model Higgs boson in the low mass Higgs range, using the physics channel ttH;H ! bb and Higgs mass mH = 120 GeV. The Neural Network analysis shows that a neural network method can give an improvement in sensitivity of the ttH;H ! bb channel. A set of Event Characteristics, associated with a topology where the existence of a reconstructed Higgs boson is not required in each event are dened and it is demonstrated that these characteristics, when used in a neural network, can improve the sensitivity of the channel by improving separation of signal and background events. The neural network analysis uses a collection of Generic Event Characteristics, a neural network of layout 36 : 8 : 4 : 1, 1000 learning cycles and 734033 ttH;H ! bb simulated signal and background events, for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb 1, to give an output sensitivity of 4 : 74. We see that the neural network analysis method as described in this analysis improves the sensitivity of the channel from that of the Cuts-Based Analysis performed in previous studies. In the quest for new and multipurpose physics searches and studies, ATLAS will produce data of unprecedented volume and rate in Particle Physics. As analysts are internationally located, data must be accessible across worldwide collaborating institutions. A signicant challenge for the ATLAS collaboration lies in developing the capacity in computing terms to manage an unprecedented data challenge in a uid, sound and transparent way. The ATLAS Event Level Metadata System, TAG Database, is a central part of the ATLAS Computing system. The Event Level Metadata system captures information about ATLAS physics events on an event by event basis, and oers later access to the events for analysis. In this thesis, developments and implementation of the Event Level Metadata system are presented in terms of three studies, these are Feasability, Scalability and Accessibility. Feasibility studies demonstrate that an Event Level Metadata system can operate within the larger ATLAS software system and gathered information on the implications for Event Level Metadata system development. Scalability studies present implementation and performance of a realistic terabyte scale relational TAG Database and demonstrate that an Event Level Metadata system at terabyte scale is achievable. Accessibilty studies present the development of a web interface to the Event Level Metadata system. Studies in this thesis therefore demonstrate that an Event Level Metadata can be integrated with the ATLAS software system, develop solutions for integration, prove that an Event Level Metadata relational database can scale to <b>ATLAS</b> terabyte <b>size,</b> present performance results for a realistic ATLAS scale system and develop a user interface to the Event Level Metadata system...|$|R
40|$|I must {{apologize}} {{that this}} Bulletin appears late. Material had been assembled {{for it and}} I had anticipated to compose this number about Christmas 1971. But on my birthday, 31 Oct. 1971, it was announced as a complete surprise that the firm of Brill was authorised to publish {{a book on the}} Javanese Mountain Flora of which the core is 57 hand-coloured plates on which 456 different species are depicted. The fieldwork was done, and drawings were composed in 1939 - 1941. After the war no publisher could be found; a precursor with 4 plates appeared in Endeavour (21, 1962, 183 - 193). The condition attached to this allowance was that I should promise stante pede to deliver the text by end December 1971 or at least as soon as possible, because the promotors of the plan intended to present me with the printed book on the occasion of my retiring from office, 1 Sept. 1972. So the rather peculiar situation arose that I had to make my own present. With my already tight time schedule for my last year of office I hesitatingly agreed. The available text was, however, very incomplete, having been written in the war prison camp, thirty years ago. Moreover it was at that time intended to be very popular for a pocket <b>size</b> <b>atlas,</b> as Schröter’s ’Pflanzenführer fur Alpenwanderer’ which had stood model for the purpose. With the generous life-size plates and folio format book now envisaged to edit, this text had to be completely rewritten in much enlarged scope and all captions carefully checked with the present literature and with the herbarium. Though the plates are explained by the captions, the general text also needed illustration and so figures had to be made or selected and photographs sorted. I had to give this project absolute priority. Notwithstanding the most liberal assistance rendered to me by my senior staff members, to whom I could entrust several time-consuming official duties, the composition of the text was real slave labour for seven days a week until late for five months. The captions were delivered end January, the general text May 22 nd. The colour plates are printed and come out magnificently, practically as good as the original water-colour drawings, and the captions are by now in page proof, so that I hope the work will indeed be printed early September and available in October. Publication of Flora Malesiana proceeds well. In April 1971 the third instalment of the Fern volume appeared (Lindsaea-group by Dr. Kramer) and the text for a fourth instalment by Prof. Holttum & Drs. Hennipman is almost finished in MS. The final instalment of vol. 6 is in press and will appear presumably in September. Of vol. 7 the first instalment containing revisions of 12 families appeared in Jan. 1972. The second instalment of vol. 7 is in print (Fagaceae, Passifloraceae) and will appear in autumn. There is the prospect of publishing in the rather near future three very large families: Moraceae, Cyperaceae and Dipterocarpaceae. From the third chapter of this Bulletin it can be observed that progress with revisional work is satisfactory, though speed of publication still falls short of my expectation...|$|R
