Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water.

500|$|Jackson's {{vision of}} Middle-earth was {{described}} as being [...] "Ray Harryhausen meets David Lean" [...] by Randy Cook. Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted {{to make the world}} rational and believable. For example, the New Zealand Army helped build Hobbiton months before filming began so the plants could really grow. Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the fell beast to help it fly. In total, 48,000 pieces of armour, 500 bows, and 10,000 arrows were created by Weta Workshop. They also created many prosthetics, such as 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet for the lead actors, as well as many ears, noses, <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cast, and around 19,000 costumes were woven and aged. Every prop was specially designed by the Art Department, taking the different scales into account.|$|E
500|$|M-6 {{starts at}} exit64 on I-196 in Ottawa County near Hudsonville. The freeway runs {{southeast}} from the interchange through the rural Georgetown and Jamestown townships toward the county line. Through this area, MDOT traffic surveys measured a traffic count of 27,117vehicles on average per day, the lowest along the freeway, in 2010. At Kenowa Avenue, the South Beltline crosses into Byron Township in Kent County. The freeway corridor is bounded {{on each side}} by farmland, scattered subdivisions, and small pockets of woodland. Near the Wilson Avenue interchange, M-6 curves to the northeast {{around the edge of}} the Ironwood Golf Course <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interchange with Byron Center Avenue. On either side of the freeway at Byron Center Avenue, there are two hospitals, Metro Health and St. Mary's Southwest, the former located on the very southern edge of the city of Wyoming. Continuing east, the beltline curves to the southeast and into the cloverleaf interchange complex at US131. This [...] "mammoth" [...] interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8km) in one direction and over a mile (1.6km) in the other, encompassing 27bridges and 18retaining walls. This makes it the largest freeway interchange in Western Michigan. There are four overpasses which carry M-6 over the US131 freeway: two for the main carriageways in each direction and two for the collector-distributor lanes on each side. The auxiliary lanes funnel the traffic using the interchange off the main carriageways to eliminate conflicts between merging streams of traffic. In the eastbound direction, the collector-distributor lane also has access to a ramp for traffic bound for 68th Street, which runs parallel to, and south of, the M-6 freeway. No such access to 68th Street is provided for westbound M-6 traffic, although 68th Street traffic can access each direction of M-6 or US131.|$|E

While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her {{when they first met}} and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bathroom to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of interactive entertainment, and fast driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of [...] "The Hound", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.|$|E
