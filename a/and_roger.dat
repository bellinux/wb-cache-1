5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{reconcile}} some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree of facial resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in The Englishman that Orton's mother was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne's grandfather. An alternative story has Orton's mother seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton <b>and</b> <b>Roger</b> half-brothers. Other versions have Orton <b>and</b> <b>Roger</b> as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity. The Claimant's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years. There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family.|$|E

This time the good will breaks the spell on the whole kingdom, and Rothbart is severely weakened.|$|R
