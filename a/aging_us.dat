50|$|In Operating systems, <b>aging</b> (<b>US</b> English) or ageing is a {{scheduling}} {{technique used}} to avoid starvation. Fixed priority scheduling is a scheduling discipline, in which tasks queued for utilizing a system resource are assigned a priority each. A task {{with a high}} priority is allowed to access a specific system resource before a task with a lower priority is allowed to do the same. A disadvantage {{of this approach is}} that tasks assigned with a lower priority may be starved when a large number of high priority tasks are queued. Aging is used to gradually increase the priority of a task, based on its waiting time in the ready queue.|$|E
50|$|The {{anti-tank}} {{grenade launcher}} was originally developed around 1960 {{and put into}} service by the Bundeswehr shortly thereafter.

The Lanze was a product of a period in which the German army was re-equipped with locally developed arms and equipment and retired the <b>aging</b> <b>U.S.</b> gear that had formed their initial arsenal.

The demand for gastroenterology care and diagnostic procedures continue to increase, driven by an increasing incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the need for colorectal cancer screening in the <b>aging</b> <b>U.S.</b> population.

But he's {{given a chance to}} redeem himself after a village in Indian Territory is overrun by a gang of violent, ruthless criminals, who've killed an elderly preacher, Rev. George Goodnight (Jon Lormer). His spinster daughter, Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn), wants to join Cogburn to track the criminals down, becoming his unwilling partner. But Rooster must use care, because the criminals, led by Hawk (Richard Jordan) and Breed (Anthony Zerbe), have stolen a shipment of nitroglycerine. Rooster rides by the following morning, while Eula and Wolf mourn their friend's and family member's deaths. Rooster convinces them to come, but he attempts to drop them off at Bagby's Store, but the trio follow him close behind. Meanwhile, in a scuffle between two bandit men, one of them is wounded by a stab wound. The wagon also hit a rock, but the men manage to fix it. Rooster, Wolf, and Eula stake out at a crossing in the woods, barricading the path with logs. The bandits are stopped and Rooster threatens to blow up the wagon unless the men dismount, which they do. A man attempts to shoot Rooster in the back, but Eula makes the perfect shot and kills him. Another man tries the same, but is killed instantly by a bullet to the chest. Rooster cries out [...] "Posse!" [...] and his two partners fire into the air, causing the men to actually think he has a posse, which they flee. Rooster captures the wagon.|$|E
