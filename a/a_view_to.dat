5|$|As {{his wealth}} grew, Moore {{began to worry}} about his legacy. With {{the help of his}} {{daughter}} Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>to</b> protecting his estate from death duties. By 1977, he was paying close to a million pounds a year in income tax; to mitigate his tax burden, he established the Henry Moore Foundation as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of the visual arts and especially the works of Moore. It now runs his house and estate at Perry Green, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios.|$|E

Waltzing a Courtship, an anonymous drawing, was widely circulated in various publications.

5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>to</b> laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E

During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned {{as leader of the}} Labour Party with immediate effect.|$|E
40|$|Patient {{management}} information tracks general {{facts about the}} location of the patient and the providers assigned to care for the patient.

All of these views can be supported in a highly efficient manner by the use of appropriate indexes...|$|R

5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One {{exception}} was in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers with <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>to</b> ending it. The conference established a committee {{under the leadership of}} U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E

After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan {{would be unable to}} compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out, so the 70,000ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Gifu's {{most famous}} castle is Gifu Castle, located on Mount Kinka.

The next resident, Oda Nobunaga, changed the castle's name {{at the same time that}} he changed the name of the surrounding town. From the top of the castle, visitors have a 360-degree view, effectively giving them <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>to</b> all of the city's borders. Inside the castle are many artifacts from its past.|$|E
40|$|Real {{estate is}} an {{important}} industry in most countries. However, {{the analysis of the}} real estate market is very challenging as the data are high dimensional and have complex spatial and temporal patterns. In this paper, we present a novel Web-based visual analytics system, which integrates state-of-the-art interactive visualizations to enable end users to create their own visualizations and gain insight into the real estate market. The system is implemented using the new features in HTML 5, which are natively supported in current browsers. We adopt <b>a</b> coordinated <b>view</b> design in our system consisting of four major components: <b>a</b> map <b>view</b> <b>to</b> show the geographical information of houses, <b>a</b> stacked graph <b>view</b> <b>to</b> show the evolution of house sales over time, <b>a</b> pixel-bar <b>view</b> <b>to</b> visualize multiple attributes of houses, and <b>a</b> treemap <b>view</b> <b>to</b> present the hierarchical structure of the data. Novel clutter reduction methods and rich user interactions are further proposed to enhance the flexibility and analytical ability of the whole system. We have applied our system to real property market data and obtained some interesting findings. Moreover, feedback from the end users of our system is very positive...|$|R
