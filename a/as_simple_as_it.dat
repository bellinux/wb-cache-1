500|$|According to Judith B. Rosenfeld of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, Naylor {{makes the}} {{statement}} that children raised in healthy families make ethical choices and ultimately thrive. In a 1994 interview Naylor said: [...] Naylor believes {{that there is much}} [...] "gray area between right and wrong". Instead of following the straightforward correct path, Marty is forced to select between two unpalatable choices. Reviewer Matt Berman of The Times-Picayune believed that the book's main moral is that [...] "nothing is <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> seems". Entertainment Weekly Michele Landsberg praised the novel, writing that Shiloh is a [...] "strongly persuasive story of moral growth, told without a hint of moralizing and with acute insight into a preadolescent's inner life".|$|E

GameFront's Phil Hornshaw {{said it had}} an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. According to Donlan, the story is <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can get. McShea said that although it does not pick up until near the end, it [...] "becomes powerful and moving in unexpected ways, peaking in a thrilling conclusion that successfully touches on many different emotions and provides closure for this epic tale." [...] Juba, on the other hand, considered that the plot [...] "doesn't have any standout revelations or developments".|$|E

Conversely, Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew judged from the same preview that the animation was lacking. While not discounting its storytelling, music, and production design, he felt that production skimped on animation; he was still looking forward to the series.|$|E

[...] She stated that [...] "While the concept of [...] "a lot of pretty people dancing at dusk" [...] is pretty simple, the neon colors manage to amp up the video, as does the colored sand that's thrown around in the air and mixed with glitter." [...] Her conclusion of the video and of Kesha was that <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> may be, [...] "she manages to be both sexy and fun while rolling around in the desert."

[...] While Serch reached out to DJ Premier, Large Professor contacted Pete Rock to collaborate with Nas on what became [...] "The World Is Yours".

500|$|Following {{the death}} of {{terrorist}} Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a resurgence in the popularity of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] video occurred. The official YouTube video was flooded with comments regarding {{the death of}} bin Laden and it was immediately deemed a celebratory anthem for the event. Moreover, the song's association to his death continued on other social medias, like Facebook and Twitter, and it was played as individuals celebrated outside of the White House. About it becoming an anthem for bin Laden's death, Nitsuh Abebe of New York magazine wrote, [...] "I have to confess that my list of reactions to the news did not get anywhere near 'watch a Miley Cyrus video.' The reason it occurred to others is surely <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> seems: This is a recent hit song whose title {{is dominated by the}} words [...] "party" [...] and [...] "U.S.A." [...] Looking for anything more apt would be overthinking it.

It is, just like bin Laden's death, another convenient opportunity to celebrate ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of}} the situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E

In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter {{could be construed as}} a contract. The case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward involved Dartmouth College, which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King George III. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, New Hampshire passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred [...] "vested rights" [...] on the trustees.|$|E
2500|$|Author Carol P. from Total TV Online, when {{describing}} JR as a tortured soul, commented, [...] "In {{the annals of}} literary history, there are many examples of the tortured soul anti-hero; i.e. Prince Hamlet, Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre, etc." [...] She said that people are drawn to these characters [...] "specifically {{because they are not}} your run-ofâ€“the mill male protagonists who win the day" [...] and that they are rather [...] "flawed {{to such a degree that}} we, as the reader or the viewer are often afraid, that they may never find the peace and joy we desire for them". P. drew similarities between Dixie and Babe, reasoning that Babe possesses several of Dixie's worst qualities (lying, manipulation, unfaithfulness, etc.), and concluded that this was another reason JR married Babe: How can a young man, who has been raised with mixed messages about love, truth, and self worth, find a suitable life mate? For JR it wasnâ€™t <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> appeared to have happened. There is so very much about Arabella 'Babe' Carey that was reminiscent to JR of his 'lost' mother; her size, her build, her coloring, her accent, her love of life, people, and experiences. JR was a goner the moment he spent any amount of time with her. What JR neglected to realize was that one person cannot and should not replace anyone in our lives; and that no two people will ever be exactly alike.|$|E

But, like the recent search in the buildings, the scouting was for a long time attended by no results. Many weary miles were passed slowly over, and more than half their task was ended, and no sign of being having life was met, except the very visible trail of their four guests, and the tracks of a single horse along the path leading to the settlements from the quarter by which the visiter of the previous night had been known to approach. No comments were made by any of the party, as each in succession struck and crossed this path, nearly at the same instant; but a low call from Reuben Ring which soon after met their ears, caused them to assemble in a body at the spot whence the summons had proceeded.|$|E
60|$|But I believe {{no cause}} {{to have been}} more active in the {{degradation}} of our natural feeling for beauty, than the constant use of cast iron ornaments.

No ornaments, on the contrary, are so cold, clumsy, and vulgar, so essentially incapable of a fine line, or shadow, as those of cast iron; and while, on the score of truth, we can hardly allege anything against them, since they are always distinguishable, at a glance, from wrought and hammered work, and stand only for what they are, yet I feel very strongly that there is no hope of the progress of the arts of any nation which indulges in these vulgar and cheap substitutes for real decoration. Their inefficiency and paltriness I shall endeavor to show more conclusively in another place, enforcing only, at present, the general conclusion that, if even honest or allowable, they are things in which we can never take just pride or pleasure, and must never be employed in any place wherein they might either themselves obtain the credit of being other and better than they are, or be associated with the downright work to which it would be a disgrace to be found in their company.|$|E
