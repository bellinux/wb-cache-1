5|$|The {{idea that}} would spawn Microsoft {{initiated}} when Paul Allen showed Bill Gates {{the first of}} January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800. Allen <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> saw potential to develop an implementation of the programming language BASIC interpreter for the system. Bill Gates called the creators of the new microcomputer, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation {{in order to win}} a contract with the company. Allen <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter. When Allen flew to Albuquerque to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute Altair BASIC. Allen <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> left Boston, where Allen worked for Honeywell <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> was enrolled in Harvard, moved to Albuquerque (where MITS was located), and co-founded Microsoft there. Revenues of the company totaled $16,005 by the end of 1976.|$|E
5|$|Helen {{brings the}} jewels to an appraiser, who recognizes them as having {{recently}} been reported stolen. Donelly <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> bring Helen into the station, where they inform her Hal is the Creeper and accuse her of harboring a murderer. Reluctantly, she agrees {{to help them}} capture him. The next day, the newspapers run stories about Helen cooperating with police, which infuriates Hal. Feeling betrayed, he sneaks back into her apartment and finds her playing the piano. Sneaking up from behind, Hal is about to strangle her when the police seize and arrest him. The film ends with Donelly <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> assuring Helen she will get the operation she needs.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>AND</b> <b>gate</b> {{represents}} {{a combination of}} independent events. That is, the probability of any input event to an <b>AND</b> <b>gate</b> is unaffected by any other input event to the same gate. In set theoretic terms, this {{is equivalent to the}} intersection of the input event sets, and the probability of the <b>AND</b> <b>gate</b> output is given by: ...|$|R
50|$|An <b>AND</b> <b>gate</b> gives a 1 output {{when both}} inputs are 1; a NOR gate gives a 1 output only when both inputs are 0. Therefore, an <b>AND</b> <b>gate</b> {{is made by}} {{inverting}} the inputs of a NOR gate.|$|R
5|$|According to Sharon, {{there is}} no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources, {{although}} it is known that Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses there that have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture. Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones of different colors, particularly red and white, that decorate the facades <b>and</b> <b>gates</b> of some houses.|$|E
5|$|Castle Hill, {{also called}} Mere Castle, was a medieval {{fortification}} built by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, in 1253 {{on a hill}} overlooking the village of Mere, Wiltshire, England. The castle was constructed in stone, with six towers, inner buildings <b>and</b> <b>gates.</b> It was abandoned in the 14th century and stripped of its stone and metalwork. Only earthworks remain in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates {{partnered with}} Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a noncompetitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was {{in support of}} Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa. Federer <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6–4.|$|E
500|$|In the 16th century, the {{antiquarian}} John Leland {{described the}} bridge {{in one of}} his Itineraries: [...] "From Monk's Gate the wall extends Westwards to the river Monnow. In the wall are four gates: Monk's <b>Gate,</b> East <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> Wye <b>Gate...</b> <b>and</b> Monnow <b>Gate</b> which is above the bridge crossing the river Monnow." [...] A visual depiction of the bridge <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> is included in John Speed's work The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain, published in 1611. His map of Monmouthshire includes an inset map of the town that shows the Monnow Bridge <b>and</b> <b>Gate</b> as well as a similar gatehouse on the Wye Bridge.|$|R

50|$|Following road {{widening}} in the 1970s {{the front}} fencing was removed <b>and</b> the <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> posts (replicas of the originals) were relocated higher up the hill.|$|R
5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden fences <b>and</b> <b>gates,</b> paths {{covered with}} locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen {{to give the}} impression of an old-fashioned country garden.|$|E
5|$|The tunnels {{were built}} {{by more than}} 300,000 local citizens, {{including}} school students, on volunteer duties. Some portions were even dug {{without the help of}} any heavy machinery. Centuries-old city walls, towers <b>and</b> <b>gates,</b> including the old city gates of Xizhimen, Fuchengmen, and Chongwenmen were destroyed to supply construction materials for the complex.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no longer}} a {{business}} requirement to remain in Albuquerque so Microsoft wanted to relocate to a larger city that would be more attractive to new employees. The San Francisco bay area was considered but Allen <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> decided to return home to Seattle. Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.|$|E
50|$|The {{gates of}} the wall in anti {{clockwise}} order, are Lohari Gate, Bohar Gate, Haram Gate, Pak <b>Gate,</b> Delhi <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> Dolat <b>Gate.</b> Bloody Bastion is located on a turn between Pak <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> Delhi <b>Gate.</b>|$|R

5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink or blue cap that contrasts with a pallid, whitish, polished stipe.|$|E
5|$|Adilabad, a fort {{of modest}} size, {{built on the}} hills {{to the south of}} Tughlaqabad was {{provided}} with protective massive ramparts on its boundary around the city of Jahanpanah. The fort was much smaller than its predecessor fort, Tughlaqabad fort, but of similar design. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in its evaluation of the status of the fort for conservation has recorded that two gates, one with barbicans between two bastions on the south-east and another on the south-west. Inside, it, separated by a bailey, is a citadel consisting of walls, bastions <b>and</b> <b>gates</b> within which lay the palaces.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E

5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls <b>and</b> <b>gates</b> of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were still largely intact. During the next hundred years city and town walls across England began to be demolished to make way for new developments, and Worcester proved no exception. By {{the end of the century}} the walls <b>and</b> <b>gates</b> were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was probably the last to be demolished, early in the 19th century. Only a few tracts of wall survived, often concealed behind other buildings and new constructions.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield <b>and</b> <b>gates,</b> returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.|$|E

5|$|The {{script for}} Danger: Diabolik {{was written by}} Dino Maiuri, Tudor Gates, Brian Degas, and Bava. The {{screenplay}} was adapted from three different Diabolik stories: Sepolto vivo! ("Buried Alive!") from August 1963, Lotta disperata ("Desperate Fight") from March 1964, and L'ombra nella notte ("Shadow In The Night") from May 1965. Like Law, Degas <b>and</b> <b>Gates</b> had also worked on Barbarellla. Film editor Romana Fortini and cinematographer Antonio Rinaldi were also brought in, having worked with Bava on his previous films such as Planet of the Vampires and Kill, Baby, Kill. Other crew members included future Academy Award winners, such as set designer Carlo Rambaldi (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) and composer Ennio Morricone (The Hateful Eight).|$|E
5|$|As a child, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{was sent}} {{to live in a}} village that his father named Ambohimanga. As a young man, his father granted him the region of Avaradrano {{surrounding}} the village, and while his father still lived he managed the daily affairs of state in Avaradrano without taking the title of king. He declared Ambohimanga the capital of the region, building numerous structures on the site and adding its first set of defensive walls, ditches <b>and</b> <b>gates.</b> The site's historic and cultural significance was recognized in 2001 when UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, {{the only one in the}} cultural category in Madagascar. He became an independent king upon his father's death and the resulting partition of the Kingdom of Imerina in 1710, from which he received Avaradrano, the easternmost and largest territory. He died around 1730 and was buried at Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{fighting}} between 1648 and 1649, the Third English Civil War {{broke out in}} 1651. Royalist forces {{under the command of}} Charles II advanced as far as Worcester, where the army paused to reinforce the walls further and await reinforcements in relative safety. The Parliamentary forces under Oliver Cromwell attacked in early September; the ensuing battle of Worcester saw the Royalist forces pushed steadily back into the city. Fort Royal was successfully stormed by the Essex militia and its guns turned on the city itself. Cromwell's men began forcing their way into the city from west, south and east and by the evening the city had fallen. The collapse marked the end of the Third Civil War. In the aftermath the bastions and other fortifications were mostly destroyed by Parliament, although the medieval walls <b>and</b> <b>gates</b> were spared.|$|E
30|$|For {{a circuit}} with n inputs {{consisting}} of addition <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> multiplication <b>gates,</b> {{the numbers of}} computation for each addition <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> multiplication <b>gate</b> in their scheme are n and n 2 +n respectively, which are very inefficient.|$|R

40|$|The <b>gate</b> length <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> contour of a GaAs metal-semiconductor {{field effect}} {{transistor}} (MESFET) device play important roles in determining the small signal circuit parameters and large signal breakdown voltage behavior, GaAs MESFETs with different <b>gate</b> lengths <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> contours were studied by the two-dimensional (2 -D) semiconductor device simulations to investigate the dependence of small signal circuit parameters and breakdown voltage on <b>gate</b> length <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> contour. The results show that gate length affects small-signal circuit parameter C(gs) while gate contour affects C(gd). The breakdown voltage has strong dependence on <b>gate</b> contour <b>and</b> little dependence on gage length...|$|R
