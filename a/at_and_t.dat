40|$|Objective: To confirm in vivo the {{hypothesis}} that hemofiltration with a large pore membrane can achieve significant cytokine clearance. Method: We used a well-known animal model of endotoxinic shock (0. 5 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia Coli {{over a period of}} 30 mins). Six pigs were hemofiltrated for 3 hours with a large pore membrane (78 angstrom pore, 80 kDa cut off) (Sureflux FH 70, Nipro, Osaka, Japan). The ultrafiltration rate was 45 ml/kg/min. Samples were taken from arterial, venous line and in the ultrafiltrate <b>at</b> <b>T</b> 120 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 240. We measured concentrations of interleukin 6, interleukin 10 <b>and</b> albumin. Results: <b>At</b> <b>T</b> 120 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 240, the IL- 6 clearances were 22 +/- 7 and 15 +/- 3 ml/min, respectively. The IL- 6 sieving coefficients were 0. 97 <b>and</b> 0. 7 <b>at</b> <b>T</b> 120 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 240, respectively. <b>At</b> <b>T</b> 120 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 240, the IL- 10 clearances were 14 +/- 4 and 10 +/- 7 ml/min, respectively. The sieving coefficients were 0. 63 <b>and</b> 0. 45 <b>at</b> <b>T</b> 120 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 240, respectively. The concentrations of IL- 6 and IL- 10 were the same <b>at</b> <b>T</b> 0 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 240. <b>At</b> <b>T</b> 60 <b>and</b> <b>T</b> 240, the plasmatic albumin concentrations were 24 +/- 4 g/L and 23 +/- 4 g/L, respectively (p = 0. 13). Conclusions: In this animal model of endotoxinic shock, we confirm the high cytokine clearance observed when hemofiltration is applied to a large pore membrane. The loss of albumin seems negligible. The impact of such clearances on hemodynamic stability and survival remains to be proved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} narrative for {{the invention}} of the <b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> one-time pad was related by David Kahn. Based on the evidence available in the <b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> patent files and from interviews and correspondence, he concluded that Gilbert Vernam came up with the need for randomness, while Joseph Mauborgne realized the need for a non-repeating key. Examination of other documents suggests a different narrative. It is most likely that Vernam came up with the need for non-repetition; Mauborgne, though, apparently contributed materially to {{the invention of}} the two-tape variant. Furthermore, there is reason to suspect that he suggested the need for randomness to Vernam. However, neither Mauborgne, Herbert Yardley, nor anyone at <b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> really understood the security advantages of the true one-time tape. Col. Parker Hitt may have; William Friedman definitely did. Finally, we show that Friedman's attacks on the two-tape variant likely led to his invention of the index of coincidence, arguably the single most important publication in the history of cryptanalysis...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: In facial biometrics, face {{features}} {{are used as}} the required human traits for automatic recognition. Feature extracted from face images are significant for face biometrics system performance. Approach: In this thesis, a framework of facial biometric was designed based on two subspace methods i. e., Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). First, PCA is used for dimension reduction, where original face images are projected into lower-dimensional face representations. Second, LDA was proposed to provide a solution of better discriminant. Both PCA and LDA features were presented to Euclidean distance measurement which is conveniently used as a benchmark. The algorithms were evaluated in face identification and verification using a standard face database-AT and T and a locally collected database-CBE. Each database consists of 400 images and 320 images respectively. Results: LDA-based methods outperform PCA for both face identification and verification. For face identification, PCA achieves accuracy of 91. 9 % (<b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T)</b> and 76. 7 % (CBE) while LDA 94. 2 % (<b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T)</b> and 83. 1 % (CBE). For face verification, PCA achieves Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1. 15 % (<b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T),</b> 7. 3 % (CBE) while LDA 0. 78 % (<b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T)</b> and 5. 81 % (CBE).

40|$|Altered genome {{methylation}} is {{a hallmark}} of human malignancies. In this study, high-throughput analyses of concordant gene methylation and expression events were performed for 91 human prostate specimens, including prostate tumor (T), matched normal adjacent to tumor (AT), and organ donor (OD). Methylated DNA in genomic DNA was immunoprecipitated with anti-methylcytidine antibodies and detected by Affymetrix human whole genome SNP 6. 0 chips. Among the methylated CpG islands, 11, 481 islands were found located in the promoter and exon 1 regions of 9295 genes. Genes (7641) were methylated frequently across OD, <b>AT,</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> samples, whereas 239 genes were differentially methylated in only T and 785 genes in both <b>AT</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> but not OD. Genes with promoter methylation and concordantly suppressed expression were identified. Pathway analysis suggested {{that many of the}} methylated genes in T and AT are involved in cell growth and mitogenesis. Classification analysis of the differentially methylated genes in T or OD produced a specificity of 89. 4 % and a sensitivity of 85. 7 %. The T and AT groups, however, were only slightly separated by the prediction analysis, indicating a strong field effect. A gene methylation prediction model was shown to predict prostate cancer relapse with sensitivity of 80. 0 % and specificity of 85. 0 %. These results suggest methylation patterns useful in predicting clinical outcomes of prostate cancer...|$|E

Blood samples of 50 subjects, including 25 healthy volunteers and 25 patients with COPD, were analysed. Serum trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) was determined by enzymatic assay. CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes were enumerated in heparinized blood using a fluorescence activated cell sorter counter. The STIC in COPD patients was found to be decreased significantly than in controls (P < 0. 01). In COPD patients with lower expression levels of α 1 AT, a highly significant {{decrease in the number of}} CD 4 + T lymphocytes (P < 0. 0009) and CD 4 /CD 8 ratio was observed compared with control subjects (P < 0. 008).
