5|$|As Pat Moran recovers in the hospital, {{he sends}} {{messengers}} out to contact {{his wife and}} child, but they all fail to find them. One day, the blind girl has lost her way and stumbles into the hospital grounds. She encounters the doctor and tells him of her story and plight. Weakly reclining in a chair nearby, Pat Moran overhears her and recognizes the girl as his daughter. The grief of the separated family abates with their reunion and doctor's <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the blind girl that her sight can be restored.|$|E
5|$|In late September 2010, the Supreme Court {{considered}} removing presidential immunity. In October, Chief Justice Chaudry {{met with}} his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening {{the power of the}} Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.|$|E
5|$|Johnson proclaimed {{amnesty for}} all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered {{for a few}} weeks to receive <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> it still applied to him even though he had not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E

5|$|Marcus {{continued}} {{throughout his}} tenure to hold tightly to his father's <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be}} able to maintain and act on his political convictions while running the business. He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) {{opened a}} file on Burhop in 1948, believing {{him to be}} a secret member of the Communist Party of Australia, and an {{associate}} of Ian Milner, who was known through Venona intercepts to have passed secret documents to the Soviet Union. In July 1951, the British government cancelled his passport when he accepted an offer to travel to the Soviet Union. A new passport was issued after he gave the Foreign Secretary a written <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> he would not seek to travel to the Soviet Union or other Iron Curtain countries.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} his execution, Bonnet {{wrote to}} Governor Johnson, begging abjectly for clemency and promising {{to have his}} own arms and legs cut off as <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> he would never again commit piracy. Charles Johnson wrote that Bonnet's visibly disintegrating mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported that the governor delayed his execution seven times. Bonnet was eventually hanged at White Point Garden, in Charles Town, on 10December 1718.|$|E

5|$|An {{announcement}} was made on July 13, 2006 stating that Episode Two would be released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 {{in addition to the}} PC, where previous iterations of the series separated. It was originally rumored that Episode Two would be delayed until 2008. On June 14, 2007, however, Valve confirmed the release date for Episode Two to be October 9, 2007 for all announced platforms. Valve handled the development of the game for the PC and Xbox 360, while Electronic Arts British office in Chertsey worked on the PlayStation 3 version of the game. It was announced on September 7, 2007 that the PlayStation 3 version of the game would be delayed because the development studio behind the game was in the United Kingdom, away from Valve's development team, and therefore lagged behind in its schedule. Valve's marketing director, Doug Lombardi, gave <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions of the game would be identical in functionality and performance.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{arrived in}} the United States in February 1935, and joined the faculty at Cornell University on a salary of $3,000. Bethe's {{appointment}} {{was part of a}} deliberate {{effort on the part of}} the new head of its physics department, Roswell Clifton Gibbs, to move into nuclear physics. Gibbs had hired Stanley Livingston, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence, to build a cyclotron at Cornell. To complete the team, Cornell needed an experimentalist, and, on the advice of Bethe and Livingston, recruited Robert Bacher. Bethe received requests to visit Columbia University from Isidor Isaac Rabi, Princeton University from Edward Condon, University of Rochester from Lee DuBridge, Purdue University from Karl Lark-Horovitz, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from Francis Wheeler Loomis, and Harvard University from John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. Gibbs moved to prevent Bethe from being poached by having him appointed as a regular assistant professor in 1936, with an <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> promotion to professor would soon follow.|$|E
5|$|Desiring {{to return}} to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. Within sight of the U.S. border, he steadfastly refused to seek a pardon, {{although}} 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council instructed the state's congressional delegation to seek <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge {{to return to}} the U.S. prior to the pardon being issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.|$|E

5|$|Heikkinen {{signed on}} as an {{assistant}} coach at Michigan in the spring 1939 initially expressing ambivalence about playing professional football. Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> a coaching job would be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was cut by the Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{continued}} to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress. He introduced legislation {{to build more}} forts in the northwest, to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, so {{the people living in}} Indiana and Illinois would have some <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the road's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly. Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it more accessible to year-round steamboat travel.|$|E

5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow {{expressed}} satisfaction with {{the events of the}} day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner's <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> he would be given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
5|$|On his deathbed, Hamilton {{asked the}} Episcopal Bishop of New York, Benjamin Moore, {{to give him}} holy communion. Moore {{initially}} declined to do so, on two grounds: that {{to participate in a}} duel was a mortal sin, and that Hamilton, although undoubtedly sincere in his faith, was {{not a member of the}} Episcopalian denomination. After leaving, Moore was persuaded to return that afternoon by the urgent pleas of Hamilton's friends, and upon receiving Hamilton's solemn <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> he repented for his part in the duel, Moore gave him communion. Bishop Moore returned the next morning, stayed with Hamilton for several hours until his death, and conducted the funeral service at Trinity Church.|$|E

5|$|Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy {{attacked}} him but her <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> it will integrate) and an abutment {{is in place}} to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E
