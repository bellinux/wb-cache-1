5|$|The Columbidae <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> {{divided into}} five subfamilies, {{probably}} inaccurately. For example, the American ground and quail doves (Geotrygon), which <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> {{placed in the}} Columbinae, seem to be two distinct subfamilies. The order presented here follows Baptista etal. (1997), with some updates.|$|E
5|$|Tolerances <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> ±0.002in (±0.05mm), but in precise {{applications}} a {{tolerance of}} ±0.0005in (±0.01mm) can be held.

5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E

5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E

Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.|$|E
