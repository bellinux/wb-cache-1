Together with graduate student Jan van Erven, the famous aerosol expert Sheldon Friedlander of the University of California (UCLA), and the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, Marijnissen set out to experiment. He managed to do achieve this by using his favourite electrospray method.

Theoretically, this efficiency should rise proportionally to engine load and, consequently, to gas temperature. This pattern, however, is disturbed by the formation of products of incomplete combustion in the catalytic afterburner, especially by those of aldehydes, even at high temperature. The efficiency of combustion of individual groups of compounds (aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) was analyzed. Two treatment systems were tested: <b>a</b> <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> with Ce–Pt and the same filter with Pt–Ce as active agents. Of these, the Ce–Pt system {{was found to be}} more efficient.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the focus is}} on the {{particulate}} matter reduction of ships, as ships contribute significantly to the particulate matter concentration in ambient air. Because the fuel of sea ships contains a lot of ash, the emitted particulate matter will also contain a lot of ash. In car and truck applications the soot filters are cleaned by burning the particulate matter off of the filter. However, ash will not be burned off and accumulates in the filter. In the case of high-ash loads, like sea ships, <b>a</b> <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> is not applicable, because the filters cannot be cleaned properly. The goal of the research was to develop a technology to reduce particulate matter that is fuel insensitive. In this thesis such a technology is described, tested and simulated for high-ash applications. The patented technology is based on coating particulate matter with water, and subsequently capturing by an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). In the present experimental set-up this was a two-stage ESP, which has a robust construction and a reduced risk of physical contact between the electrodes at different potential. The water-coated particles will flow off the collection plates, therefore allowing continuous operation of the ESP. The water stream needs to be cleaned before it is discharged in the surface waters. The required cleaning technology, however, is similar to the cleaning technologies used in sea water scrubbers. It is proven that the technology is capable of removing 80 % of particulate matter, including the fraction of particulate matter smaller than 1 micrometer in (mobility) diameter. It was found that the new technology was rather insensitive to particle size and is thus very suitable to remove sub-micron particles. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The new {{emission}} control regulations for the diesel engines impose less soot particulate emissions. The particulates are dangerous and very harmful for the enviroment. Today, the CO and HC emissions of the diesel engines are already very low but the NOx and particulates emissions are still high. These are {{the goal of}} the modern {{emission control}} technologies. The reduction of the NOx and particulates emitted can be reduced with improvements in the engine design, fuel, oil and additive technologies and with exhaust after treatment. The <b>soot</b> <b>filters</b> collect the particulates from the diesel engine exhaust gas. The filter efficiency can be over 90 % and the durability is satisfactory. When the trap's soot load is high the regeneration is necessary to retain the efficiency and to avoid the filter failure. The regeneration methods must be further developed in order to avoid problems cause from the heat released during the combustion of the soot. These problems must be completely solved, for the soot traps to become a common used emission control device in passenger cars. Today, <b>soot</b> <b>filters</b> in passenger cars are used only from PSA, but the emission control regulations in the future will impose every vehicle with a diesel engine to have reduced particulates emissions. That will lead in the wide use of <b>soot</b> <b>filters.</b> The design and improvement of soot traps can be much more easier, more efficiently and with less cost with the use of <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> simulation software. Many tests and modifications can be made, avoiding the experimental cost. Besides, many parameters of the filter function can be computed and analysed faster and reliably. The diploma thesis with title 'Modeling of ceramic soot filters' was conducted within the purposes of the research project 'Development of computational tools for exhaust after-treatment systems design optimization' for PSA Peugeot Citroen, at the Laboratory of Thermodynamics and Thermal Engines, of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. The goal of the diploma thesis is the presentation of the basics of soot traps and the calculations conducted with the <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> simulation software Catwall. The validation of the model as well as to find the points that need to be improved {{are a part of the}} thesis. The properties of the materials, soot and insulation were defined and there was an effort to choose the most suitable kinetics scheme for the soot combustion and the additive reaction. The first chapter describes the emissions of the diesel engines, the emissions regulations, the soot particulates, the <b>soot</b> <b>filters</b> basics, regeneration, materials and the fuel additive. The second chapter deals with the modeling of the experiments of the small filters, conducted by PSA. The experiments are described and the results from the calculations are compared with the measurements with SiC and Cordierite filters. In the next chapter the experiments conducted with insulated filters by the IFP are described and then the temperature and ΔΡ calculations are presented. The effort to choose the most suitable kinetics parameters follows as well as the comparison of 4 kinetics schemes for the soot combustion without additive.

40|$|Diesel engine {{particulate}} filters {{every year}} {{are becoming more}} popular. The new EURO 5 standard is very restrictive for particulates and this will force the use of particulate filter in every engine.

During regeneration high temperature zones may occur in the filter which may change the properties of porous material and even cause its damage.

The dielectric constant and dielectric loss are related to ionic conduction at low frequencies, while at microwave frequencies storage and loss mainly proceed through reorientation of molecular dipoles. The dielectric constant rises for a higher degree of La substitution by Ce, which is explained by an increase of the number of cation/oxygen vacancies. Concurrently the mean perovskite crystallite size decreases, which is possibly related to defect formation.

However, the offresonance emissions near the vacuum ultraviolet region (VUV) were weaker than the NO fluorescence, and the ε(0, 3) band of the NO fluorescence, which appeared near the VUV region, was free from the O_ 2 fluorescence.

Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and isotope exchange experiments demonstrate the key role of bulk oxygen species in the oxidation process. When "intimate" soot/YSZ contact is achieved after in situ carbon deposition via propylene cracking, lattice oxygen ions are the predominant species involved in the oxidation reaction. Based on isotopic TPO experiments performed with different oxygen partial pressures in "tight" contact mode and oxygen exchange measurements, it is proposed that the ignition of the soot oxidation on YSZ {{can be described as}} a fuel-cell-type electrochemical mechanism at the nanometric scale. The efficiency of this electrochemical process seems to depend both on the YSZ/soot contact and on the oxygen partial pressure.

The first two validation experiments were cable fires in a large-scale enclosed corridor and the third experiment analysed the <b>soot</b> produced from <b>a</b> <b>soot</b> generator in <b>a</b> warehouse with a high ceiling.

The sooting turbulent jet flame has a total visible flame length of approximately 400 mm and a fuel-jet Reynolds number of 10, 000. The flame has a measured lift-off height of 26 mm which acts as a sensitive marker for CFD model validation, while this novel compiled experimental database of soot properties, temperature and velocity maps are useful for the validation of kinetic soot models and numerical flame simulations. Due to the relatively simple burner design which produces a flame with sufficient soot concentration while meeting modelers' needs with respect to boundary conditions and flame specifications {{as well as the}} present lack of <b>a</b> <b>sooting</b> "standard flame", this flame is suggested as a new reference turbulent sooting flame.

This work adopted both experimental and numerical approaches to study soot formation in laminar counterfl ow diffusion flames. As polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the precursors of <b>soot</b> particles, <b>a</b> detailed gas-phase chemical mechanism describing PAH growth upto coronene for fuels with 1 to 4 carbon atoms was validated against laminar premixed and counter- flow diffusion fl ames. Built upon this gas-phase mechanism, <b>a</b> <b>soot</b> model was then developed to describe soot inception and surface growth. This soot model was sub- sequently used to study fuel mixing effect on soot formation in counterfl ow diffusion flames. Simulation results showed that compared to the baseline case of the ethylene flame, the doping of 5 % (by volume) propane or ethane in ethylene tends to increase the soot volume fraction and number density while keeping the average soot size almost unchanged. These results are in agreement with experimental observations. Laser light extinction/scattering as well as laser induced fluorescence techniques were used to study the effect of strain rate on soot and PAH formation in counterfl ow diffusion ames. The results showed that as strain rate increased both soot volume fraction and PAH concentrations decreased. The concentrations of larger PAH were more sensitive to strain rate compared to smaller ones. The effect of CO 2 addition on soot formation was also studied using similar experimental techniques.
