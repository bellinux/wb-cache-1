25|$|By 1877, {{when federal}} forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana {{and other states}} had regained control of state legislatures, often by {{paramilitary}} {{groups such as the}} White League, which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised blacks <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> by raising barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.|$|E
25|$|The state {{population}} in 1900 was 47% African-American: {{a total of}} 652,013 citizens. Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of free people of color before the Civil War. By 1900, {{two years after the}} new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state. Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries. White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after Congressional passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North {{compared}} to 9 million in the South. While the North's population was almost entirely white, the South had an enormous number of black slaves <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> [...] While the latter were free, becoming a soldier was seen as the prerogative of white men only. Many Southerners were terrified at the idea of a black man with a gun. Excluding old men and boys, the white males available for Confederate service were less than two million. [...] There was also the additional burden that the near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between the owner and [...] "owned". The North had vastly greater industrial capacity, built nearly all of the locomotives, steamships, and industrial machinery and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all of the munitions facilities were in the North, while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.|$|E

2500|$|After 1840 [...] "abolition" [...] usually {{referred}} to positions like Garrison's; {{it was largely}} an ideological movement led by about 3000 people, including free blacks <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> many of whom, such as Frederick Douglass, and Robert Purvis and James Forten in Philadelphia, played prominent leadership roles. [...] Abolitionism had a strong religious base including Quakers, and people converted by the revivalist fervor of the Second Great Awakening, led by Charles Finney in the North in the 1830s. Belief in abolition contributed to the breaking away of some small denominations, such as the Free Methodist Church.|$|E

2500|$|By the 18th century, Maryland had {{developed}} into a plantation colony and slave society, requiring vast numbers of field hands for the labor-intensive commodity crop of tobacco. In 1700 the province had {{a population of about}} 25,000, and by 1750 that number had grown more than 5 times to 130,000. By 1755, about 40% of Maryland's population was black, with African Americans concentrated in the Tidewater counties where tobacco was grown. [...] An extensive system of rivers facilitated the movement of produce from inland plantations to the Atlantic coast for export. Baltimore was the second-most important port in the eighteenth-century South, after Charleston, South Carolina. In the first two decades after the war, a number of slaveholders freed their slaves. In addition, free families of color had started during the colonial era with mixed-race children of unions between white women and African men. By the time of the Civil War, slightly more than 49% of the blacks <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> in Maryland were free.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{his works}} Justin Chin worked to {{give voice to}} marginalized groups of racial, {{national}} or sexual minorities.

We are not homogenous." [...] In the same Mongrel: Essays, Diatribes + Pranks he also questions identities as he writes: [...] "I’ve given up {{the dream of the}} Queer Nation. Race, class, gender, ideologies, and values will always divide us[...] [...] [...] I am so over being queer these days, and I don’t care what I call myself these days or what anyone else calls me; it’s all a matter of convenience these days." [...] In this way he used his writings to problematize the dominant language and naming by not purely accepting it but rather problematizing it as a [...] "matter of convenience". When thinking of Justin Chin problematizing and critique were some of the core goals of his writings. In an interview with Gerry Gomez Pearlberg for Frigate ’zine, Chin said, “Every work of art that works as art is a critique.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the church}} began to collide and meld with {{cultures}} outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison {{some of the}} parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to Mormonism. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar Bruce R. McConkie drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the Gentiles within Christianity, and encouraged members {{not to be so}} indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in Mormonism. Other peoples, he stated, [...] "have a different background than we have, which is of no moment to the Lord.... It is no different to have different social customs than it is to have different languages.... And the Lord knows all languages". In 1987, Boyd K. Packer, another Latter-day Saint Apostle, stated, [...] "We can't move [...] with a 1947 Utah Church! Could it be that we are not prepared to take the gospel because we are not prepared to take (and they are not prepared to receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?" [...] During and after the Civil Rights Movement, the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial.
