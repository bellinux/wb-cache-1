5|$|In June 2010, it was {{reported}} that plans were made to create a film titled Die Hard 24/7, which would serve as a crossover between 24 and the Die Hard franchise, with Sutherland to reprise his role as Jack Bauer alongside Bruce Willis' John McClane. However, these plans never came to fruition, with the studio instead opting to create the film <b>A</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Day</b> to Die Hard.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is {{succeeding}} {{at all of}} his tasks, and as {{a result}} of having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day,</b> as he is on a roll, he decides to help Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) figure out her relationship status with Carol (Matt Damon). Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) enlist the help of actor Kelsey Grammer to help them pull off a scam, and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to film a commercial for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{offensive}} {{performance was}} {{in some ways the}} opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated on the ground and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25yards on thirteencarries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran threetimes for fiveyards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost sixyards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43passes for 213yards and oneinterception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90yards on eightcatches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught fourpasses for 54yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9yards.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold. Millinery was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds {{could be found in}} Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital Copy protection that tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to rip discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled <b>A</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Day</b> to Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E

25|$|The {{distance}} a trireme {{could cover}} {{in a given}} day depended much on the weather. On <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day,</b> the oarsmen, rowing for 6–8 hours, could propel the ship between eighty and a hundred kilometres. There were rare instances however when experienced crews and new ships were able to cover nearly twice that distance (Thucydides mentions a trireme travelling 300 kilometres in one day). The commanders of the triremes also had to stay aware of the condition of their men. They had to keep their crews comfortably paced {{so as not to}} exhaust them before battle.|$|E

Monkeys, monitor lizards and snakes like the python and the cobra still abound, and on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day,</b> the trekkers may even be treated to sightings of the macaque, palm civet cat, and Philippine civet cat. The entire area is an insect paradise, teeming with the creatures that are {{a staple of the}} diet of the Philippine tarsier, which will only ingest them live. All these may be observed either at ground level or from a series of elevated decks erected along the trail, some with restrooms nearby.|$|E

25|$|Rosenborg {{was still}} not Trondheim's {{dominant}} football team, and clubs such as Brage, Falken, Freidig, Kvik, Nidelv and Ranheim were still capable of beating Rosenborg on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day.</b> Rosenborg signed forward Tor Kleveland ahead of the 1963 season, and still had the whole cup-winning team and Krogh, which made Rosenborg {{the most popular of}} the Trondheim teams. Up to 8,000 spectators would see matches at Lerkendal. The season ended with a third place, but afterwards Krogh transferred to Sweden's Högadal. Rosenborg again ended in third place in the league, behind Nidelv—the city's best team for the season. However, Rosenborg managed to reach the cup final, after beating Skeid in the round of 16, Vålerengen in the semi-finals, and won the cup after beating Sarpsborg 2–1 in the final. The season also saw a trip to Astrakhan in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Bunning pitched for the Detroit Tigers through 1963. During the 1963 Winter Meetings, the Tigers traded Bunning and Gus Triandos to the Philadelphia Phillies for Don Demeter and Jack Hamilton. In {{his first}} season with the Phillies, Bunning entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard {{in the first game}} of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor {{preserved}} the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off the bases. Bunning also had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day</b> at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had reached a three-ball count on only two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game.|$|E
25|$|For signal processing, the Wiener filter is {{a filter}} {{proposed}} by Wiener during the 1940s {{and published in}} 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose {{is to reduce the}} amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimation of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the future, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target has moved, and maybe has changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>day,</b> American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel, on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality---a theory for predicting the future as best as one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that didn't strictly speaking predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.|$|E
