5|$|The Ninth Amendment {{declares}} {{that there are}} additional fundamental rights that exist outside the Constitution. The rights enumerated in the Constitution are not an explicit and exhaustive list of individual rights. It was rarely mentioned in Supreme Court decisions before {{the second half of}} the 20th century, when it was cited by several of the justices in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The Court in that case voided a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives as an infringement of the right of marital privacy. This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built decisions in several landmark cases, including, Roe v. Wade (1973), which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get <b>an</b> <b>abortion,</b> and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated a Pennsylvania law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining <b>an</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems.

To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on <b>an</b> <b>abortion,</b> at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E

5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth.

5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} open to the defendant, among them self-defence.

Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E
40|$|Background: Considering {{that there}} is no general {{agreement}} on use of misoprostol as the best method for the termination of pregnancy in first trimester, this study aimed to compare the vaginal ultrasonography and serum Î²-hCG in the confirming of <b>a</b> complete <b>abortion.</b> Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 133 patients with <b>a</b> missed <b>abortion</b> or the blighted ovum diagnosed by vaginal ultrasonography, and a 12 week gestational sac admitted to Shabih-Khani hospital of Kashan in 2010. The patients' serum Î²-hCG levels were measured. They were assessed for the tissue discharge (abortion) after taking one or two doses of vaginal misoprostol suppositories and the oral contraceptive pills prescribed after confirming the abortion. Then vaginal ultrasonography and the serum Î²-hCG measurement were performed to diagnose the complete abortion in the second and fourth weeks of pregnancy. Results: Among 133 patients, <b>a</b> complete <b>abortion</b> was diagnosed for 116 (87. 2) and 80 cases (60. 15) based on Î²-hCG level and vaginal ultrasonography, respectively in the second week of pregnancy. In other cases, <b>a</b> complete <b>abortion</b> was diagnosed using both Î²-hCG level and vaginal ultrasonography in the fourth week. Therefore, Î²-hCG level was more effective (98. 75) than the vaginal ultrasonography to diagnose <b>a</b> complete <b>abortion</b> in the second week of pregnancy. The accordance between the two methods was 0. 327 {{at the end of the}} second week of pregnancy. Conclusion: The measurement of Î²-hCG level and vaginal ultrasonography are equally effective to confirm <b>a</b> complete <b>abortion.</b> Hence, to diagnose the complete abortion, determining the Î²-hCG level followed by clinical examination is recommended...|$|R

5000|$|The {{procedural}} requirements needed for obtaining <b>a</b> legal <b>abortion</b> were changed several times throughout the years, in 1956, 1959, 1969, 1981 and 1990. The most important change {{was that of}} 1990, after Communism fell, when Ordinance of 30 April 1990 made access to <b>abortion</b> more difficult. <b>A</b> major change came in 1993, when the law was further tightened, removing entirely the [...] "difficult living conditions" [...] as <b>a</b> ground for <b>abortions.</b> <b>As</b> such, <b>abortions</b> could be legally obtained only in cases of {{serious threat to the}} life or health of the pregnant woman, as attested by two physicians, cases of rape or incest confirmed by a prosecutor, and cases in which prenatal tests, confirmed by two physicians, demonstrated that the foetus was seriously and irreversibly damaged. This law remains in place today.|$|R
