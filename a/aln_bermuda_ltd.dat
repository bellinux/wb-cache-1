5000|$|Bermuda shorts {{originated}} with the British Army for wear in tropical and desert climates, {{and they are}} still worn by the Royal Navy, as well as the Royal Canadian Navy. During the Second World War there was a shortage of clothing in Bermuda. According to Jack Lightbourn, former Executive Vice President of the Bank of Bermuda, the general managers of the two banks in Bermuda, The Bank of <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Ltd</b> and The Bank of N.T. Butterfield and Sons Ltd [...] were concerned that their male employees would not have suitable clothing to wear. They arranged for a local tailor to make two pairs of shorts, modeled on the shorts of the British military, for each of their male employees. The shorts were made from a very itchy grey flannel material, and each employee was supplied with two pairs of heavy grey wool long socks to wear with the shorts. This was the beginning of Bermuda shorts as business attire in Bermuda. In the post war period local merchants such as Trimingham Bros. and H.A. & E. Smiths improved the design of the shorts and used bright coloured materials as the shorts became more popular.|$|R

40|$|New York {{may have}} just become {{a great place to}} be a {{judgment}} creditor. In the summer of 2009, the Court of Appeals of New York handed down its decision in Koehler v. Bank of <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Ltd.</b> In Koehler, the court upheld a turnover order directing a garnishee to transfer a nonresident judgment debtor’s assets, deposited in a Bermuda bank, into New York. Under Koehler, assets anywhere in the world may now be garnishable in New York so long as the garnishee is subject to the state’s jurisdiction. This decision greatly broadens New York courts’ power to enforce judgments by reaching property located outside of New York. Accordingly, the decision is an incredible victory for judgment creditors, yet a serious defeat for judgment debtors. Because of New York’s status as a financial and corporate capital—and the concomitant number of institutions doing business within the state—this decision has a potentially far-reaching impact. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Koehler decision raises some serious constitutional and policy concerns. As some commentators fear, the decision may ultimately turn New York courts into a “mecca” for judgment creditors seeking to reach assets located anywhere in the world. This Comment seeks to explore the issues raised by the Koehler decision. In doing so, this Comment analyzes theories of due process and state power in the realm of postjudgment garnishments. This Comment ultimately concludes that the Koehler decision was correctly decided, particularly because it will afford judgment creditors an incredibly useful tool in satisfying their judgments...|$|R

The High Court had refused leave to appeal, because a point was raised which had not been mentioned during arbitration. Staughton LJ, {{with the rest of the}} Court in agreement, explained that: [...] the judge should give such weight as he thinks fit to the failure to argue the point before the arbitrator. In particular, he should have regard to whether the new point is similar to points that were argued, perhaps a variant of one of those points or a different way of putting it on the one hand, or whether it is a totally new and different point on the other. The conditions for leave to appeal are laid out in Section 1(4). No conditions attach to an appeal where all parties consent, but when the permission of the High Court is sought, the judge may only grant leave if he [...] "considers that...the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement". Under Sections 1(5) and 1(6), the High Court may ask for additional reasons as to why the arbitrator reached the decision that he did, but only if one of the parties gave notice to the arbitrator that reasons would be required, or there was [...] "some special reason why such a notice was not given". In Universal Petroleum Co v Handels und Transport GmbH, the Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of Sections 1(4) and 1(5). The dispute came from a highly detailed [...] "Schedule of Further Reasons" [...] ordered by the High Court because the judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in the reasons given. The appellate judges found that Section 1(5) required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from the award. Material ambiguity was [...] "inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of the exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act".|$|R

40|$|This solo {{exhibition}} of recent paintings was through invitation by the New Heritage Gallery, Hamilton, Bermuda. The Directors selected artists {{who had already}} previously shown in galleries in Europe and North America. This work extended longer term research themes in experimental depictions of variant light conditions in Southern and Northern hemispheres. Many new exploratory visual experiments were tested through an extensive iterative process, a selection of works being selected by the gallery selection panel. This research focus emerges largely from Healey’s experience of dual nationality (Anglo/Brazilian) {{and in particular the}} cultural impact of differing qualities of available light in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Healey investigated this impact as exemplified in the work of several of the Scottish Colourists following their work in the Hebrides and then Southern Europe. (Peploe, Cadell, Hunter and Ferguson and the works of Bilcliffe and Hewlitt) The rationale and research questions underpinning the project were essentially that visual research methods undertaken in the Hebrides, with new exploratory visual experiments undertaken on Iona, could be extended and adapted to specific atmospheric conditions in Bermuda. While primary focii included the increased saturation of light and colour, the issues of place and identity were additional visual and intellectual questions, together with Healey’s long standing interests in art practice as generative of theory and the investigation and development of theory as a form of practice. A catalogue was published and the Opening was attended by a number of VIPs, including the Islands' Governor and Cherie Blair. Press reviews included ‘Bermuda seen through Scottish Eyes’, The Royal Gazette 01. 12. 06 published by The <b>Bermuda</b> Press (Holdings) <b>Ltd.</b> There was also a radio interview.
