The second rapid change observed in this component, around 2011.5, occurs about a year later than at HER and HBK to the south and east, respectively. The 2009.5 change in H coincides with the one seen at HBK and is of similar amplitude, and another one around 2012.0 seems to have occurred a few months earlier than at HER and HBK and with larger amplitude.

The observatory has been operating reliably since its installation. The observatory installations consist of three huts. One hut houses the <b>absolute</b> <b>instrument,</b> the so-called D/I fluxgate theodolite, which enables the Declination and Inclination angles of the vector magnetic field to be manually measured in “absolute” terms (for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with this instrument, see Marsal and Torta, 2007). A second hut houses a variometer of the type δD/δI vector magnetometer (Riddick et al., 1995), which automatically measures the variations of the magnetic field vector once per minute. This instrument consists of two perpendicular pairs of Helmholtz coils, the polarization of which allows Declination and Inclination variations to be measured by means of a proton magnetometer located at their centre (see Marsal et al., 2007 for an assessment of this instrument). The proton magnetometer, in turn, measures the total field intensity, F, when the coils are not polarized. The electronic system controlling this automatic instrument is found in the third hut. The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) has officially recognised the Livingston Island Observatory and given it the code name LIV. It has served as a base station for the reduction of marine magnetic surveys in the zone (Maldonado et al., 2000; Livermore et al., 2000; Catalán et al., 2006), and its data have already been used in several studies and models (Torta et al., 1999, 2001, 2002; Cain et al., 2003; Gaya-Piqué et al., 2006; Marsal and Torta, 2007; Marsal et al., 2007). Apart from a few data gaps due to power supply interruptions, there are presently more than 11 years of definitive data (observatory data which have been corrected for baseline variations and which have had spikes removed) available, with the particular added value that they coincide with the complete solar cycle 23.

Currently there are several instruments that are used for attitude: gyros, inclinometers, and compasses. However, precise and useful attitude information cannot come from one instrument.

Using <b>absolute</b> <b>instruments</b> such as compasses and inclinometers can result in an accurate measurement of attitude in the long term. However, in the short term, the physical nature of compasses and inclinometers, and the dynamic nature of a mobile platform result in highly volatile and therefore useless data.

40|$|The {{resolution}} of optical instruments is normally {{limited by the}} wave nature of light. Circumventing this limit, known as the diffraction limit of imaging, is of tremendous practical importance for modern science and technology. One method, super-resolved fluorescence microscopy was distinguished with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014, but {{there is plenty of}} room for alternatives and complementary methods such as the pioneering work of Prof. J. Pendry on the perfect lens based on negative refraction that started the entire research area of metamaterials. In this thesis, we have used analytical techniques to solve several important challenges that have risen in the discussion of the microwave experimental demonstration of <b>absolute</b> optical <b>instruments</b> and the controversy surrounding perfect imaging. Attempts to overcome or circumvent Abbe’s diffraction limit of optical imaging, have traditionally been greeted with controversy. In this thesis, we have investigated the role of interacting sources and detectors in perfect imaging. We have established limitations and prospects that arise from interactions and resonances inside the lens. The crucial role of detection becomes clear in Feynman’s argument against the diffraction limit: “as Maxwell’s electromagnetism is invariant upon time reversal, the electromagnetic wave emitted from a point source may be reversed and focused into a point with point-like precision, not limited by diffraction. ” However, for this, the entire emission process must be reversed, including the source: A point drain must sit at the focal position, in place of the point source, otherwise, without getting absorbed at the detector, the focused wave will rebound and the superposition of the focusing and the rebounding wave will produce a diffraction-limited spot. The time-reversed source, the drain, is the detector which taking the image of the source. In 2011 - 2012, experiments with microwaves have confirmed the role of detection in perfect focusing. The emitted radiation was actively time-reversed and focused back at the point of emission, where, the time-reversed of the source sits. Absorption in the drain localizes the radiation with a precision much better than the diffraction limit. <b>Absolute</b> optical <b>instruments</b> may perform the time reversal of the field with perfectly passive materials and send the reversed wave to a different spatial position than the source. Perfect imaging with <b>absolute</b> optical <b>instruments</b> is defected by a restriction: so far it has only worked for a single–source single–drain configuration and near the resonance frequencies of the device. In chapters 6 and 7 of the thesis, we have investigated the imaging properties of mutually interacting detectors. We found that an array of detectors can image a point source with arbitrary precision. However, for this, the radiation has to be at resonance. Our analysis has become possible thanks to a theoretical model for mutually interacting sources and drains we developed after considerable work and several failed attempts. Modelling such sources and drains analytically had been a major unsolved problem, full numerical simulations have been difficult due to the large difference in the scales involved (the field localization near the sources and drains versus the wave propagation in the device). In our opinion, nobody was able to reproduce reliably the experiments, because of the numerical complexity involved. Our analytic theory draws from a simple, 1 –dimensional model we developed in collaboration with Tomas Tyc (Masaryk University) and Alex Kogan (Weizmann Institute). This model was the first to explain the data of experiment, characteristic dips of the transmission of displaced drains, which establishes the grounds for the realistic super-{{resolution of}} <b>absolute</b> optical <b>instruments.</b> As the next step in Chapter 7 we developed a Lagrangian theory that agrees with the simple and successful model in 1 –dimension. Inspired by the Lagrangian of the electromagnetic field interacting with a current, we have constructed a Lagrangian that has the advantage of being extendable to higher dimensions in our case two where imaging takes place. Our Lagrangian theory represents a device-independent, idealized model independent of numerical simulations. To conclude, Feynman objected to Abbe’s diffraction limit, arguing that as Maxwell’s electromagnetism is time-reversal invariant, the radiation from a point source may very well become focused in a point drain. <b>Absolute</b> optical <b>instruments</b> such as the Maxwell Fisheye can perform the time reversal and may image with a perfect resolution. However, the sources and drains in previous experiments were interacting with each other as if Feynman’s drain would act back to the source in the past. Different ways of detection might circumvent this feature. The mutual interaction of sources and drains does ruin some of the promising features of perfect imaging. Arrays of sources are not necessarily resolved with arrays of detectors, but it also opens interesting new prospects in scanning near-fields from far–field distances. To summarise the novel idea of the thesis: • We have discovered and understood the problems with the initial experimental demonstration of the Maxwell Fisheye. • We have solved a long-standing challenge of modelling the theory for mutually interacting sources and drains. • We understand the imaging properties of the Maxwell Fisheye in the wave regime. Let us add one final thought. It has taken the scientific community a long time of investigation and discussion to understand the different ingredients of the diffraction limit. Abbe’s limit was initially attributed to the optical device only. But, rather all three processes of imaging, namely illumination, transfer and detection, make an equal contribution to the total diffraction limit. Therefore, we think that for violating the diffraction limit one needs to consider all three factors together. Of course, one might circumvent the limit and achieve a better resolution by focusing on one factor, but that does not necessary imply the violation of a fundamental limit. One example is STED microscopy that focuses on the illumination, another near–field scanning microscopy that circumvents the diffraction limit by focusing on detection. Other methods and strategies in sub-wavelength imaging –negative refraction, time reversal imaging and on the case and <b>absolute</b> optical <b>instruments</b> –are concentrating on the faithful transfer of the optical information. In our opinion, the most significant, and naturally the most controversial, part of our findings {{in the course of this}} study was elucidating the role of detection. Maxwell’s Fisheye transmits the optical information faithfully, but this is not enough. To have a faithful image, it is also necessary to extract the information at the destination. In our last two papers, we report our new findings of the contribution of detection. We find out in the <b>absolute</b> optical <b>instruments,</b> such as the Maxwell Fisheye, embedded sources and detectors are not independent. They are mutually interacting, and this interaction influences the imaging property of the system.

The data selection process, followed by the joint modelling of the magnetic field and Euler angles, leads to accurate models of the main field and its secular variation around 2014.0. The obtained secular variation model is compared with models based on CHAMP satellite data. The comparison suggests that pulses of magnetic field acceleration that were observed on short time scales average-out over a decade.|$|R
30|$|In {{the view}} of {{providing}} candidates for the new IGRF- 12, we processed a combination of Swarm satellite and observatory data. In order to obtain robust models of the main field, we first applied a correction to the satellite data such that {{the strength of the}} magnetic field, as measured by the VFM instrument, matches the data measured by the <b>absolute</b> scalar <b>instrument.</b> Our underlying hypothesis is that the discrepancies between these two instruments are closely linked to the position of the Sun relative to the satellite. So far, the corrections obtained with such a hypothesis seem suitable. The results presented here are actually part of a longer term study, made in close collaboration with the European Space Agency and several other European institutions. The ultimate goal is to identify the original source of this perturbative signal such that, firstly, the Swarm satellite data can be corrected to remove that signal and, secondly, a new design can be adopted in future satellite missions to avoid such difficulties. As stated in the text, the model presented here is not optimal but corresponds to our best results available at the end of 2014.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{candidate}} {{models for}} IGRF- 12. These models {{were derived from}} parent models built from 10 months of Swarm satellite data and 1. 5 years of magnetic observatory data. Using the same parameterisation, a magnetic field model was built from a slightly extended satellite data set. As a result of discrepancies between magnetic field intensity measured by the <b>absolute</b> scalar <b>instrument</b> and that calculated from the vector instrument, we re-calibrated the satellite data. For the calibration, we assumed that the discrepancies resulted from a small perturbing magnetic field carried by the satellite, with a strength and orientation dependent on the Sun’s position relative to the satellite.

40|$|Various {{extensions}} of the Standard Model predict the existence of hidden photons kinetically mixing with the ordinary photon. This mixing leads to oscillations between photons and hidden photons, analogous to the observed oscillations between different neutrino flavors. In this context, we derive new bounds on the photon-hidden photon mixing parameters using the high precision cosmic microwave background spectral data collected by the Far Infrared <b>Absolute</b> Spectrophotometer <b>instrument</b> on board of the Cosmic Background Explorer. Requiring the distortions of the CMB induced by the photon-hidden photon mixing to be smaller than experimental upper limits, {{this leads to a}} bound on the mixing angle < 10 ^{- 7 }- 10 ^{- 5 } for hidden photon masses between 10 ^{- 14 } eV and 10 ^{- 7 } eV. This low-mass and low-mixing region of the hidden photon parameter space was previously unconstrained. Comment: Revised version (16 pages, 4 eps figures). Matches the one published on JCAP. Minor changes: typos removed, references clarified, Figure 3 slightly modified {{to take into account the}} new experimental bounds on photon-hidden photon mixing by LIPSS experiment (arXiv: 0810. 4189 [hep-ex], our Ref.

500|$|... "Say You'll Be There" [...] is a midtempo dance-pop song, with {{influences}} from G-funk and R. It {{is written in}} the key of D major, with a time signature set on common time, and moves at a moderate tempo of 108 beats per minute. The song is constructed in a verse-chorus form. It uses the sequence Bm–E–Gm–D as its chord progression during the verses and the chorus. The third verse includes an instrumental solo, that closes with a coda, which consists in the group singing the chorus repeatedly until the song gradually fades out, while Melanie Chisholm adds the high harmony. <b>Absolute</b> played the <b>instruments,</b> except for the harmonica, which was played by Judd Lander, who also played it on Culture Club's [...] "Karma Chameleon".|$|R
