500|$|For Mercury's 65th {{birthday}} in 2011, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. It included an animation {{set to the}} Mercury penned song, [...] "Don't Stop Me Now". Referring to [...] "the late, great Freddie Mercury" [...] in their 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, Guns N' Roses quoted Mercury's lyrics from his song [...] "We Are the Champions"; [...] "I've taken my bows, my curtain calls, you've brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Behold This Dreamer was {{followed}} by the publication of Poetry Concerto, also in 1961. Meanwhile, Bartlett had published more than 200 poems in literary reviews and anthologies, and felt encouraged to bring out a collection of her poetry. She sent the manuscript of the new work to Moore, who wrote: [...] "You have here what is indeed a conspectus of experience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for the book. It seems an anomaly that it is not in 'hard covers,' in shops where all might buy. This must be corrected. As I may have said before, you must not be acquiescent under neglect, nor deterred by polite evasion or any kind of inability to make headway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Olympio {{broke his}} silence, {{which was the}} subject of much speculation, in a letter {{published}} on 21 February. In that letter, he expressed confidence in Fabre and told his supporters: [...] "I will never forget the moments of enthusiasm and confidence you have always shown in all circumstances, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> forever." [...] In a radio interview on 23 February, however, he stressed that he was still in charge of the UFC. Regarding his delayed and arguably unenthusiastic endorsement of Fabre, he said that it had been necessary to consult with other political actors before backing Fabre, and he pointed to his health as the reason he was unable to accompany Fabre on the campaign trail.|$|E

"Poor lad," [...] said Louis, in {{a softer}} tone than he usually spoke in, [...] "hunger hath made him drowsy.--I know thine {{appetite}} is a wolf," [...] he continued; [...] "and I will save thee from one wild beast as thou didst me from another; thou hast been prudent too in that matter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>thee</b> for it.--Canst thou yet hold out an hour without food?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2013, Hillary Clinton, former United States Secretary of State, {{took part}} in the {{academic}} celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the founding of the University of St Andrews. Clinton received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and provided the graduation address, in which she said, [...] "I do take comfort from knowing there is a long tradition of Americans being warmly welcomed here at St Andrews. Every year I learn you educate more than one thousand American students, exposing them to new ideas and perspectives as well as according them with a first class education. I’ve been proud and fortunate to hire a few St Andrews alumni over the years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for training them so well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Military forces {{increasingly}} {{joined the}} opposition, and Nasheed resigned that day. His statement read: [...] "I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, {{the people of}} the country would suffer more. I therefore have resigned as the President of Maldives. I wish the Maldives would have a consolidated democracy. I wish for justice to be established. My wish is for the progress and prosperity of the people. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> all for your support and contributions to achieve success for the past three years." [...] He also stated his hope that his resignation might avoid international pressure on the Maldives over the unrest. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who claims to have opposed Abdulla Mohamed's arrest, was then sworn in as the new president, and a warrant was issued for Nasheed's arrest.|$|E
