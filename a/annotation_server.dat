40|$|Robinson {{and others}} have {{recently}} called for dynamic and collaborative digital scholarly editions. Annotation is a key component for editions that are not merely passive, read-only repositories of knowledge. Annotation facilities (both annotation creation and display), however, require complex software, and if only for that reason {{it makes sense to}} share these facilities among edition sites. The paper argues we therefore need a protocol for requesting (and serving) annotations, and a markup vocabulary for storing annotations. The paper proposes a SANE (Scholarly ANnotation Exchange) Request Protocol (SANE-RP) and a SANE Markup Language (SANE-ML) and shows an experimental implementation of these in annotations to a digitised emblem book. The edition (the process that generates the edition HTML from the edition XML source) requests annotation information from an <b>annotation</b> <b>server</b> using SANE-RP.

40|$|Background Recent {{advances}} in sequencing technologies {{have resulted in}} an unprecedented {{increase in the number}} of metagenomes that are being sequenced world-wide. Given their volume, functional annotation of metagenomic sequence datasets requires specialized computa-tional tools/techniques.

Although, web-based functional <b>annotation</b> <b>servers</b> address to some extent the problem of availability of compute resources, uploading and analyzing huge volumes of sequence data on a shared public web-service has its own set of limitations. In this study, we present COG-NIZER, a comprehensive stand-alone annotation framework which enables end-users to functionally annotate sequences constituting metagenomic datasets. The COGNIZER framework provides multiple workflow options. A subset of these options employs a novel directed-search strategy which helps in reducing the overall compute requirements for end...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) allows {{merging of}} DNA {{sequence}} annotations from multiple sources {{and provides a}} single annotation view. A straightforward way to establish a DAS <b>annotation</b> <b>server</b> {{is to use the}} "Lightweight DAS" server (LDAS). Onto this type of server, annotations can be uploaded as flat text files in a defined format. The popular Ensembl ContigView uses the same format for the transient upload and display of user data. Results In order to easily generate LDAS upload files we developed a software tool that is accessible via a web-interface [URL]. Users can submit their DNA sequences of interest. Our program (i) aligns these sequences to the reference sequences of Ensembl, (ii) determines start and end positions of each sequence on the reference sequence, and (iii) generates a formatted annotation file. This file can be used to load any LDAS <b>annotation</b> <b>server</b> or it can be uploaded to the Ensembl ContigView. Conclusion The eL-DASionator is an on-line tool that is intended for life-science researchers with little bioinformatics background.

Recent advances in sequencing techniques have led to a deluge of biosequence data, which necessitates the use of high-performance computing resources in order to carry out analysis in a reasonable period of time.

40|$|New {{forms of}} conceiving the web such as web 2. 0 and the {{semantic}} web have emerged for numerous purposes ranging from professional activities to leisure. The semantic web {{is based on}} associating concepts with web pages, rather than only identifying hyperlinks and repeated literals. ITACA is a project whose aim is to add semantic annotations to web pages, where semantic annotations are Wikipedia URLs. Therefore, users can write, read and vote on semantic annotations of a webpage. Semantic annotations of a webpage are ranked according to users' votes. Building upon the ITACA project, we propose a transparent, reputation-based architecture. With this proposal, semantic annotations are stored in the users' local machines instead of web servers, so that web servers transparency is preserved. To achieve transparency, an indexing server {{is added to the}} architecture to locate semantic annotations.

40|$|Abstract Background The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) is {{a widely}} used network {{protocol}} for sharing biological information. The distributed aspects of the protocol enable the use of various reference and annotation servers for connecting biological sequence data to pertinent annotations in order to depict an integrated view of {{the data for the}} final user. Results An <b>annotation</b> <b>server</b> has been devised to provide information about the endogenous retroviruses detected and annotated by a specialized in silico tool called RetroTector. We describe the procedure to implement the DAS 1. 5 protocol commands necessary for constructing the DAS <b>annotation</b> <b>server.</b> We use our server to exemplify those steps. Data distribution is kept separated from visualization which is carried out by eBioX, an easy to use open source program incorporating multiple bioinformatics utilities. Some well characterized endogenous retroviruses are shown in two different DAS clients. A rapid analysis of areas free from retroviral insertions could be facilitated by our annotations. Conclusion The DAS protocol has shown to be advantageous in the distribution of endogenous retrovirus data. The distributed nature of the protocol is also found to aid in combining annotation and visualization along a genome in order to enhance the understanding of ERV contribution to its evolution. Reference and annotation servers are conjointly used by eBioX to provide visualization of ERV annotations as well as other data sources.

40|$|KEGG ([URL] or [URL] is an {{integrated}} database resource for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. Molecular functions of genes and proteins {{are associated with}} ortholog groups and stored in the KEGG Orthology (KO) database.

40|$|One of the {{important}} data sources in bioinformatics is protein or nucleotide sequences that are used as input to many programs to collectively or individually analyze them. There exists an ample amount of protein sequences scattered over many different databases. This division complicates the process of feeding them into existing programs to be further analyzed.
