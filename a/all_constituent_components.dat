40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{implementation}} of a differential protection scheme using magneto-optic current sensors. The proposed all-Optical Differential Protection (ODP) scheme utilizes inherent properties of magneto-optic sensors connected in series to perform differential protection functionality. In order {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the proposed scheme, <b>all</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> such as optical fibre, polarisers and Faraday rotators have been modelled using the Jones matrix representation. Through selected simulation-based case studies, including external and internal (high resistive and solid) faults, the paper demonstrates that the proposed novel ODP scheme for busbar protection meets the protection relaying performance criteria in terms of discrimination, sensitivity, stability, as well as ultra-high speed of operation...|$|E
50|$|In {{the system}} {{dynamics}} methodology, {{a problem or}} a system (e.g., ecosystem, political system or mechanical system) is first represented as a causal loop diagram. A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with <b>all</b> its <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops (see figure below), a causal loop diagram reveals {{the structure of a}} system. By understanding the structure of a system, it becomes possible to ascertain a system’s behavior over a certain time period.|$|R

Structural biologists employ a variety of biophysical methods to study large macromolecular complexes, but no single technique is likely to provide a complete description of the structure–function relationship of <b>all</b> the <b>constituent</b> <b>components.</b> Since structural studies generally only provide snapshots of these dynamic machines as they accomplish their molecular functions, combining data from many methodologies is crucial {{to our understanding of}} molecular function...|$|R
30|$|The GDT is {{developed}} by Olhede et al. [19] for speech-type signal processing. This method can transform an arbitrary time-varying frequency ridge into a line paralleling {{to the time}} axis, and {{make it possible to}} separate any interested time-frequency ridge into a mono-component from other components by conventional filters. For separating the overlapped multi-components, an improved GDT is proposed in Ref. [20]. In this improved method, a varying window function is used to improve the time–frequency concentration of the generalized short time Fourier transform. Due to the characteristics of the GDT, some researchers applied it or its improved versions to process the nonstationary signals, especially for processing amplitude modulation (AM)—frequency modulation (FM) signal in recent years [21, 22]. A joint envelope and frequency order spectrum analysis method based on iterative GDT is proposed by Feng et al. [23] for diagnosing planetary gearbox under nonstationary conditions, where the iterative GDT can decompose <b>all</b> the <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> into mono-components of constant frequency.|$|R
40|$|Biopower, i. e. {{production}} of power using biomass, {{has a tremendous}} potential to deliver CO 2 neutral energy in the Nordic countries. This paper analyses {{the evolution of a}} biopower innovation system in Sweden where particular attention is given to current driving forces and obstacles to a large-scale diffusion of biopower. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, this innovation system went through a successful 'formative phase' in which <b>all</b> the <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> of the 'infant' system emerged. With the introduction of green certificates and emission trading rights, incentives were created that were large enough to shift the system into a 'growth phase', where the extensive district heating system and voluminous production in the paper and pulp industry can be used to produce power on a large scale in CHP plants. An investment boom is now underway and output of biopower is rapidly growing. Yet, there are still substantial obstacles to a realisation of the full potential of biopower. Three of these are outlined and an associated set of policy challenges are specified. ...|$|R
40|$|Islands {{across the}} world have evolved at the {{interface}} between land and sea, thus comprising landscapes and seascapes. Many islands have also been influenced by anthropogenic factors, which {{have given rise to}} mosaics of anthromes (sensu Ellis and Ramankutty). These elements of landscapes, seascapes, and cultural impacts in varied proportions, generate unique environments which merit a unique term: islandscapes. The use of the term islandscape is advocated as the only term which encompasses <b>all</b> of the <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> of an island, in a holistic manner. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the applicability of existing landscape and seascape character assessment methodologies in an island context, and to propose a methodological framework for mapping the space which defines the term ‘islandscape’. The challenges and opportunities stemming from {{the use of the term}} are exemplified with reference to the Mediterranean islands...|$|R
40|$|The pricing {{of items}} of {{construction}} work using Component Unit Pricing (CUP) Theory requires that contractors have {{to assess and}} quantify their risk profiles. Those contractors with a willingness to take on greater risks can then be rewarded with a prospect of greater profits. CUP Theory provides a basis by which {{this can be accomplished}} by way of the manner and extent to which contractors spread their overall bid prices amongst <b>all</b> of the <b>constituent</b> <b>component</b> item prices. Conversely, this theory also facilitates that contractors who want to moderate their exposure to risk are able to do so, independently of any adjustment they might choose to make to their overall mark-ups. Contractors are, however, typically unaware of their risk profiles and will not have had these assessed. There are no universally accepted or popular methods established for the assessment of the risk profiles of firms operating within th...|$|R

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to build on}} the results of Roberts and Rosenthal (1997), which consider geometric ergodicity properties of hybrid chains in terms of their <b>constituent</b> <b>component</b> algorithms. In this paper, we concentrate on two special cases, where we can make more practical geometric ergodicity statements. In the first case, we are actually able to give a quantitative result for the rate of convergence of the resulting hybrid algorithm, although this is at the expense of imposing a very strong uniform type of geometric ergodicity on the <b>constituent</b> <b>component</b> algorithms. In the second case, we consider hybrid chains arising from combining various Metropolis algorithms, and adapt results of Roberts and Tweedie (1996) to establish geometric ergodicity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this work, an {{alternative}} route to analyze {{a set of}} coherency matrices associated to a medium is addressed {{by means of the}} Independent Component Analysis (ICA) technique. We highlight the possibility of extracting an underlying structure of the medium in relation to a model of <b>constituent</b> <b>components.</b> The medium is considered as a mixture of unknown <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> weighted by unknown but statistically independent random coefficients of thickness. The ICA technique can determine the number of components necessary to characterize a set of sample of the medium. An estimate of the value of these components and their respective weights is also determined. Analysis of random matrices generated by multiplying random diattenuators and depolarizers is presented to illustrate the proposed approach and demonstrate its capabilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to near-infrared spectral (NIR) data analysis that is based on independent component analysis (ICA). The main advantage of the new method is that it is able to separate the spectra of the <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> from the spectra of their mixtures. The separation is a blind operation, since the <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> of mixtures can be unknown. The ICA based method is therefore particularly useful in identifying the unknown components in a mixture as well as in estimating their concentrations. The approach is introduced by reference to case studies and compared to other techniques for NIR analysis including principal component regression (PCR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and partial least squares (PLS) as well as Fourier and wavelet transforms. 1...|$|R

30|$|The main {{challenge}} to identifying water surfaces from remotely sensed data {{is the high}} variability of their spectral signatures. The spectral property of water {{is determined by the}} electromagnetic interaction of light with the <b>constituent</b> <b>components</b> of water via absorption or scattering processes either within the water column, at the water surface, or {{on the bottom of the}} water. These constituents are: the phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a), the suspended sediments (i.e. solid particulate matter) resulting from erosion process, and the colored dissolved organic matter resulting from the degradation of biological organisms. <b>All</b> these <b>constituents</b> vary in character and amount with the limnological/optical types, season, cyclic change of biological activity, and human impact, and play an important role in determining intensity of the absorption and scattering processes. Consequently, the water-leaving radiance detected by the sensor shows great spatial and temporal variability, which makes its reliable discrimination particularly difficult (Gond et al., 2004).|$|R
