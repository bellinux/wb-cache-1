60|$|All this time, Captain Williams {{refused to}} keep the ship away. I believe {{he wanted to get}} <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> {{neighbour}} himself, for he could not but foresee what might be the consequences, should he run down in the fog, and engage a heavier vessel than his own, without the ceremony of a hail. The sea was covered with Englishmen, and one of their cruisers might not very easily pardon such a mistake, however honestly made. But preparation seems to infer a necessity for performance. When everything was ready, all eyes were turned aft in a way that human nature could hardly endure, and the captain was obliged to yield. As Marble, of all on board, had alone seen the other vessel, he was directed to conn the Crisis in the delicate operation she was about to undertake.|$|E

6000|$|I am almost {{shocked to}} learn, through your appreciative note, that in imaginatively projecting, {{for use in}} [...] "The Outcry," [...] such a painter as the Mantovano, I unhappily coincided with an {{existing}} name, an artistic identity, a real one, with visible examples, {{in the annals of}} the art. I had never heard (in I am afraid my disgraceful ignorance) of the painter the two specimens of whom in the National Gallery you cite; and fondly flattered myself that I had simply excogitated, for its part in my drama, a name at once plausible, that is of good Italian type, and effective, as it were, for dramatic bandying-about. It was important, you see, that with the great claim that the story makes for my artist I should have a strictly supposititious one--with no awkward existing data to cast a possibly invidious or measurable light. So my Mantovano was a creature of mere (convincing) fancy--and this revelation of my not having been as inventive as I supposed rather puts me out!

5000|$|Also, the Wine Wiki page {{claims that}} Wine can help break the chicken-and-egg problem for Linux on the desktop: This {{brings us to}} the chicken and egg issue of Linux on the desktop. Until Linux can provide {{equivalents}} for the above applications, its market share on the desktop will stagnate. But until the market share of Linux on the desktop rises, no vendor will develop applications for Linux. How does one break this vicious circle?Again, Wine can provide an answer. By letting users reuse the Windows applications they have invested time and money in, Wine dramatically lowers the barrier that prevents users from switching to Linux. This then makes it possible for Linux to take off on the desktop, which increases its market share in that segment. In turn, this makes it viable for companies to produce Linux versions of their applications, and for new products to come out just for the Linux market.This reasoning could be dismissed easily if Wine was only capable of running Solitaire. However, now it can run Microsoft Office, multimedia applications such as QuickTime and Windows Media Player, and even games such as Max Payne or Unreal Tournament 3. Almost any other complex application can be made to run well given a bit of time. And each time that work is done to add one application to this list, many other applications benefit from this work and become usable too.Have <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> Application Database to get an idea on what can be run under Wine.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1960s, Fugard {{formed the}} Serpent Players, whose name derives {{from their first}} venue, the former snake pit at the zoo, [...] "a group of black actors worker-players who earned their living as teachers, clerks, and {{industrial}} workers, and cannot thus be considered amateurs {{in the manner of}} leisured whites", developing and performing plays [...] "under surveillance of the Security Police according to Loren Krugers The Dis-illusion of Apartheid published in 2004." [...] The group largely consisted of black men, including Winston Ntshona, John Kani, Welcome Duru, Fats Bookholane and Mike Ngxolo as well as Nomhle Nkonyeni and Mabel Magada. They all got together, albeit at different intervals, and decided to do something about their lives using the stage. In 1961 they met Athol Fugard, a white man from Johannesburg, and asked him if he could work with them as he had the theatre know-how, how to use the stage, movements, and everything else. They worked with Athol Fugard since then and that is how the Serpent Players go together. At the time, the group performed anything they could lay their hands on in South Africa as they had no access to any libraries. These included Bertolt Brecht, August Strindberg, Samuel Beckett, William Shakespeare and many other prominent playwrights of the time. In an interview in California, Ntshona and Kani were asked why they were doing the play Sizwe Banzi is Dead, which was considered a highly political and telling story of the South African political landscape at the time. Ntshona answered: “We are just a group of artists who love theatre. And we have every right to open the doors to anyone who wants to take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> play and our work. We believe that art is life and conversely, life is art. And no sensible man can divorce one from the other. That’s it. Other attributes are merely labels”. They mainly performed at the St Stephen’s Hall - which has now been turned into a church, and other spaces in and around New Brighton, the oldest Black township in Port Elizabeth. According to Loren Kruger, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago, the Serpent Players used Brechts elucidation of gestic acting, dis-illusion, and social critique, as well as their own experience of the satiric comic routines of urban African vaudeville, to explore the theatrical force of Brechts techniques, as well as the immediate political relevance of a play about land distribution. Their work on the Caucasian Chalk Circle and, a year later, on Antigone led directly to the creation, in 1966, of what is still 2004 South Africas most distinctive Lehrstück play:The Coat. Based on an incident at one of the many political trials involving the Serpent Players, The Coat dramatized the choices facing a woman whose husband, convicted of anti-apartheid political activity, left her only a coat and instructions to use it.|$|E
