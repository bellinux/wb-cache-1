5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales <b>about</b> <b>individual</b> failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
40|$|This study explores how {{exposure}} to disability portrayal on television {{is related to}} beliefs <b>about</b> <b>individuals</b> with disability. This study uses show-specific cultivation theory and its discussion of how television viewing can influence perceptions and beliefs {{as well as social}} cognitive theory and the process of media identification. An online survey was conducted to examine respondents' viewing habits of the television program Glee, which featured several characters who had varying disabilities (wheelchair use, down syndrome and many others), and how viewing these mediated representations related to beliefs <b>about</b> <b>individuals</b> with disability. The results showed that identification with Artie, a main character on Glee with a disability, is correlated with frequency of viewing as well as more positive beliefs <b>about</b> <b>individuals</b> with disability. In addition, any viewing of Glee, rather than frequency, was also related to more positive beliefs <b>about</b> <b>individuals</b> with disability. While social cognitive theory, in particular identification, showed strong relationships with findings, results did not line up with cultivation as frequency of viewing did not correlate with more positive beliefs. Overall, the research demonstrated that portrayal of disability in the media relates to beliefs <b>about</b> <b>individuals</b> with disability and hopes to encourage more inclusion in the media landscape as well as additional research related to disability in the media...|$|R

5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions <b>about</b> <b>individual</b> moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details <b>about</b> <b>individual</b> members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011. OMR and ICR technologies were used for data processing.|$|E

I work out a defence of the hybrid combination, including some replies to Williamson’s additional objections.
