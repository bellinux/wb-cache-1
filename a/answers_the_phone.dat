5|$|George {{does not}} arrive for {{work the next}} day. Joanne shows in a new volunteer, Glen, who is {{replacing}} Liz. Having found out that George has made similar calls to CSL for years, Andy {{plans to go to}} the police. Andy <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and it is George. In Chloe's voice, George says that he just wanted someone to listen to him, then warns that he has told the dead woman's son where Andy works. In the background, Glen stands, and points a gun at Andy's head. He calls Andy's name, and Andy turns around to see Glen right before the credits play.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E
25|$|After confronting his wife, Gavrik {{locks the}} door and {{strangles}} Elena to death. Sasha is unable to stop it. Meanwhile, Ruth joins Harry outside the bunker, and they both decide to leave the intelligence service and live together. However Sasha, armed with {{a large piece of}} broken glass and blaming Harry for his mother's death, tries to stab him. Ruth intervenes and is stabbed instead. She dies from her injuries before help can arrive, leaving Harry to mourn the loss of his love. In a telephone conversation with Towers sometime later, it is evident that Harry is considering leaving the service. It also becomes clear that Harry has engaged an outside agency to assassinate Mikhail Levrov (Jeffry Wickham) and his co-conspirators. Towers requests he not be informed of the details of these actions. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is shown walking into Levrov's house for an appointment with him. Harry is then seen entering the memorial area of Thames House with the names of all the MI5 officers who died in service, some of whom were characters who were killed during the series (Danny Hunter, Fiona Carter, Colin Wells, Zafar Younis, Ben Kaplan, Adam Carter, Jo Portman, Ros Myers, Ruth). He then walks onto the Grid, sits down at his desk and <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> indicating he intends to continue working in the service.|$|E

500|$|Deangelo {{comes to}} the branch the next day, {{and most of the}} staff is eager to make a good first impression. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) wears his toupee, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) believe they have started off well by {{mentioning}} their baby, and Deangelo designates Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) as the office [...] "funny guy" [...] when he reveals that he carries name tags around to avoid situations like the one Deangelo and Michael were in. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is not pleased that he was not selected to replace Michael, believing that Michael put in a good recommendation for him. Michael becomes disturbed, however, when Deangelo wants to make some changes, such as how Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{features}} several callback references to previous episodes. Oscar saying [...] "Whazzup!" [...] {{serves as a}} reference to a scene from [...] "Pilot" [...] between Michael, Dwight, and Jim. Jim's description in his final talking head of his job is a direct quote from his first talking head in [...] "Pilot". Dwight hires Devon back after Creed quits, a reference to [...] "Halloween", when Creed convinced Michael to fire Devon. Pam sits at reception one final time and <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> saying [...] "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam." [...] This is a reference to Pam's former role as office receptionist and a common phrase that she said during the early seasons. Pam's painting of the office building, introduced in [...] "Business School", plays a prominent role in the final scene.|$|E
500|$|Weinstein {{said that}} this episode was an {{opportunity}} for him, Oakley, and Swartzwelder to [...] "go nuts" [...] with the [...] "Burns-ism". He said that they enjoy writing for characters such as Burns and Abe Simpson because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because they get to use thesauruses for looking up [...] "old time slang". For example, Burns <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> by saying [...] "Ahoy, hoy!", which was suggested by Alexander Graham Bell {{to be used as}} the proper telephone answer when the telephone was first invented. Burns' kitchen is full of [...] "crazy old-time" [...] devices and contraptions. For inspiration, Weinstein brought in [...] "a bunch" [...] of old books with designs of old kitchen devices. Oakley commented that the stuffed polar bear had always been in Burns' office, and they were excited to [...] "finally" [...] have a use for it.|$|E

500|$|In December 1992, McEntire's seventeenth studio album, It's Your Call, was released. It {{became her}} first album to peak within the Billboard 200 Top 10, {{reaching}} No. 8. McEntire {{commented that the}} record was a [...] "second chapter" [...] to For My Broken Heart, while music reviewers such as Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly disagreed, writing, [...] "In truth, it isn't nearly as pessimistic as its predecessor—and unfortunately it isn't anywhere as involving." [...] Nash called the album's title track—which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart—"one of those moment-of-truth sagas at which McEntire excels. In the song, a wife <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to find her husband's girlfriend {{on the other end}} and seizes the opportunity not only to inform her mate that she knows of his affair but to give him the ultimatum of choosing between the two. She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line, she sings, handing her husband the phone. It's your call." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{listening}} to the finished tracks, the members selected guest appearances they felt would work with the songs. The group [...] "aim for the stars" [...] on its choices of collaborators, with Wentz stating, [...] "I {{want to bring in}} people who no one would expect...This year it's like, we made some new friends, like Lil Wayne. Or let's get Jay-Z on there." [...] Wentz commented on working with Jay-Z, saying [...] "It was insane. We called him up and thought we were gonna talk to his assistant. Then he <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> like, 'Yo, this is Hov,' and we were like, 'Um ...' It just happened like that. And it was pretty crazy." [...] Jay-Z recorded his introduction to the album's opening song [...] "Thriller" [...] while on tour in Australia and sent it to the band, who later put the vocal on the album. At a fashion show in Los Angeles, Wentz met rapper Kanye West, who invited Wentz and Stump to his home to share new music. West then agreed to create a remix of [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] three weeks before the scheduled release of the album. The band was unable to include the remix on the album due to time constraints, but a remix of West's version featuring Lil Wayne, Lupe Fiasco, Travis McCoy, Paul Wall and Tyga was released in July 2007.|$|E

In season two, it is revealed that she lives at 6338 Hope Street. As problems arose with getting Willis and Shepherd on screen due to personal issues, the writers started {{to focus on}} the relationship between Agnes and fellow Blue Moon employee Herbert Viola.

2500|$|Despite Carlson's {{abundant}} culinary skills, {{his restaurant}} Schwa {{has struggled to}} stay afloat. Carlson has described the restaurant as living [...] "from paycheck to paycheck". This {{has been attributed to}} a complete lack of business acumen, and is a source of frustration for Achatz and Trotter. Despite long reservation waiting lists, on any given night Schwa is usually half empty, partly by choice, partly because Carlson rarely <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> The restaurant's voice mail is frequently full, meaning potential customers are unable to make, or cancel, reservations. Schwa does not have a liquor license, which takes away a large source of potential income (and an even larger source of potential profit). [...] Carlson has claimed limited size of Schwa makes storing wine bottles and glasses difficult, and that it allows him to be educated by the sophisticated customers who bring in their own wines. [...] Achatz called Carlson's decision not the offer wine [...] "stupid," [...] while Trotter said he was [...] "crazy" [...] for [...] "leaving so much money on the friggin' table." [...] For a portion of 2007, Carlson even closed Schwa on Saturdays – traditionally the most profitable day for restaurants – to spend time with his family.|$|E
2500|$|Assuming Jamal is cheating, {{the police}} are involved. After an initial beating, the police {{inspector}} listens to Jamal's explanation of how he reached each answer. Finding all of them [...] "bizarrely plausible", he allows him back on the show. At Javed's safehouse, Latika sees Jamal on the news and Salim, {{in an effort to}} make amends for his past behaviour, gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal. Latika is reluctant out of fear of Javed, but agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, awaiting for Javed and his men as they realize that he let Latika free. Jamal's final question is the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, which he never learned. Jamal uses his [...] "Phone-A-Friend" [...] lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows. Latika <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe. Relieved, Jamal arbitrarily picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim has betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door but Salim kills Javed before he is shot, gasping, [...] "God is great". Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the railway station and they kiss.|$|E

Just as Donald is beginning {{to pull the trigger}} to kill the beavers, the telephone in the lookout post rings. After a brief moment of panic and deadlocked decisions (if Donald doesn't <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> he will lose his job, but if he does answer it, it will give the beavers a chance to get away), Donald rushes away to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> It's <b>the</b> chief ranger calling to make sure Donald is guarding Old Sequoia, but scolds him for <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and orders him to go back to work.|$|R
