5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook {{would have allowed}} the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{was also}} an {{innovator}} {{in the realm of}} craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces ("trencadís") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of primary colours, and sometimes a neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.|$|E

5|$|In 1854, a Spanish singing teacher named Manuel García (1805–1906) {{became the}} first man to view the {{functioning}} glottis in a living human. In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E
5|$|Like a Virgin is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to become the record producer of her next album. However, her label {{was not ready to}} give her the artistic freedom and she chose Nile Rodgers instead to produce the album due to his work with David Bowie. Madonna wrote six songs on the record, five of which feature Steve Bray as a co-writer. The album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> introduced at that time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} astronomer {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> of investigation. Until {{the early years of}} the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E
5|$|Upon death, Avatar Roku was reincarnated and Aang was born, {{and later}} raised by Monk Gyatso, a senior monk at the Southern Air Temple {{and friend of}} the late Avatar Roku. Even prior to {{learning}} he was the Avatar, Aang distinguished himself by {{becoming one of the}} youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique.</b> As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples. Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he remained suspended for a century.|$|E

25|$|It {{is during}} the siege of Perpignan that the French barber surgeon Ambroise Paré, {{accompanying}} the French army, had the idea for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique.</b> During the battle, Maréchal de Brissac was wounded, having {{been shot in the}} shoulder. As the bullet was impossible to find for extraction, Paré had the idea to ask the victim to put himself in the exact position he was in when shot. The bullet was then found and removed by Henry's personal surgeon Nicole Lavernault.|$|E
25|$|Klee {{began to}} {{introduce}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> in 1905: scratching on a blackened glass panel with a needle. In that manner he created about 57 Verre églomisé pictures, among those the 1905 Gartenszene (Scene on a Garden) and the 1906 Porträt des Vaters (Portrait of a Father), {{with which he}} tried to combine painting and scratching.

The disciple first boils the nose, then stomps on it, finally removing the beads of fat the treatment extracts from the nose.

25|$|Catheter-directed {{thrombolysis}} (CDT) is <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> {{found to}} be relatively safe and effective for massive PEs. This involves accessing the venous system by placing a catheter into a vein in the groin and guiding it through the veins by using fluoroscopic imaging until it is located next to the PE in the lung circulation. Medication that breaks up blood clots is released through the catheter so that its highest concentration is directly next to the pulmonary embolus. CDT is performed by interventional radiologists, and in medical centers that offer CDT, it may be offered as a first-line treatment. Catheter-based ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Art {{certainly}} cannot advance under {{compulsion to}} traditional forms, and nothing {{in such a}} field is more stifling to progress than limitation {{of the right to}} experiment with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>technique.</b> The foolish judgments of Lord Eldon about one hundred years ago, proscribing the works of Byron and Southey, and the finding by the jury under a charge by Lord Denman that the publication of Shelley's Queen Mab was an indictable offense are a warning to all who have to determine the limits of the field within which authors may exercise themselves. We think that Ulysses is a book of originality and sincerity of treatment and that it has not the effect of promoting lust.
