Short-blocks used for the 4.6L Callaway engines were stamped with a 9.60:1 {{compression}} ratio marking from Land Rover. The increase of 0.25 points, up from the standard 4.6L compression ratio of 9.35:1 was achieved by a modification to the cylinder heads. The cylinder heads were also modified to improve the airflow {{into and out of the}} combustion chambers. The inlet manifold gasket front valley clamp has been changed to accommodate the heater hose positioning on the bottom front of the Callaway manifold. The ram pipe housing has been modified by shortening the ram pipe tube lengths. The intake runner lengths were tuned to increase both power and torque. The black plastic <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> was replaced with a larger diameter fancy looking carbon fiber inlet tube to match the larger throttle bore in the plenum. The air cleaner box base was modified to increase the airflow. The Lucas GEMS ECU was calibrated to support the mechanical changes to the Callaway engine (the Callaway engine had the same basic FI as in 1998 and did not have the Bosch system that was on other 1999 HSEs).|$|E

Mineral salt broth (MSB) medium (0.5 L) and L-arginine hydrochloride (10 g) were placed in a 2.8-L Fernbach flask fitted with an <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> and a vapor bulb extended through the closure of the flask mouth. The flask, fittings, and contents were sterilized in an autoclave. After cooling, the previously prepared flask of inoculum was transferred to the Fernbach flask using aseptic technique. The vapor bulb was charged with chlorobenzene (10 mL), and the flask was shaken on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and 30° for 48 hours. The vapor bulb with excess chlorobenzene was removed, and the pH of the aqueous contents of the flask was measured and adjusted to pH ~9 if necessary. The aqueous mixture was divided equally into centrifuge tubes and the solids were separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at ~8,000 rpm. The aqueous supernatant was decanted, combined, saturated with NaCl, and extracted with EtOAc (4 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4 or MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure, giving 190 mg of a tan colored solid. Centrifugation was used to aid breaking of any emulsions observed with the organic extracts. Recrystallization of the solid from CH2Cl2-hexane gave an off-white solid, 0.160 g, mp 82-84°; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 6.12 (m, 1H), 5.87 (m, 2H), 4.48 (m, 1H), 4.19 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 2.74 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 2.63 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 134.9 (C), 128.0 (CH), 123.4 (CH), 122.7 (CH), 71.4 (CH), 69.1 (CH).|$|E
30|$|The {{air inlet}} system of {{traditional}} engines mainly relies on absorption by the quarter-wavelength straight-tube to suppress high-frequency noise, but two major problems exist. First, the quarter-wavelength straight-tube has a narrow denoising band and cannot cover the low-frequency noise band completely, which results in incomplete noise reduction. Second, due to the greatly restricted radial size of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> in the engine’s inlet system, the longer length of the traditional quarter-wavelength straight-tube {{will be difficult to}} arrange in a compact car {{air inlet system}}. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of muffler design, which has the advantages of both the quarter-wavelength straight-tube and Helmholtz muffler, with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size. When used in a practical automobile test, the muffler showed excellent performance in high frequency noise reduction of the air inlet system, and this performance was supported by the experimental data.|$|E

The results are reported of a parametric study of the process of separation of methane, which is the most important gas in the mixture and usable as a biofuel, from particles and H 2 S. A cyclone, which is a conventional, economic and simple device for gas-solid separation, is considered based on the modification of three Texas A&M cyclone designs (1 D 2 D, 2 D 2 D and 1 D 3 D) by the inclusion of an <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>tube.</b> A parametric sizing is performed of the cyclone for biogas purification, accounting for the separation of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and dust particles from the biofuel. The stochiometric oxidation of H 2 S to form elemental sulphur is considered a useful cyclone design criterion. The proposed design includes geometric parameters and several criteria for quantifying the performance of cyclone separators such as the Lapple Model for minimum particle diameter collected, collection efficiency and pressure drop. For biogas volumetric flow rates between 0 and 1 m/s and inlet flow velocities of 12 m/s, 15 m/s and 18 m/s for the 1 D 2 D, 2 D 2 D and 1 D 3 D cyclones, respectively, it is observed that the 2 D 2 D configuration is most economic in terms of sizing (total height and diameter of cyclone). The 1 D 2 D configuration experiences the lowest pressure drop. A design algorithm coupled with a user-friendly graphics interface is developed on the MATLAB platform, providing a tool for sizing and designing suitable cyclones...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{power plants}} offer the {{advantage}} of highly efficient power generation. The DLR Institute of Technical Thermodynamics {{is part of a}} research partnership developing a hybrid power plant. The project is divided into 3 phases lasting until 2012. The first phase focuses on modelling the components of the power plant. A model library for MATLAB Simulink containing several fuel cell models as well as balance of plant components has been developed. Utilizing these models the control system of the hybrid power plant can be designed and tested before the plant is built. To enable the control model to fit the needs of a real hybrid power plant high descriptive quality of the component models is required. Therefore the SOFC generator models are validated in house. DLR-TT has many years of experience in testing single cells as well as short stacks in SOFC as well as in PEMFC. For this project, a Siemens SFC- 5 system has been installed in Stuttgart. This system enables DLR to verify tubular SOFC models. In addition a new test rig is going to be built allowing measuring pressurized planar SOFC. Test results from both experimental set ups will be used to validate the models. The presentation focuses on the modelling performed so far in the project. A locally resolved fuel cell model will be presented. The model features <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>tube</b> and the fuel cell, both interacting with each other resulting in a 1 + 1 D model.

The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. <b>Air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities of 0. 6 m/s, 1. 6 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time.
