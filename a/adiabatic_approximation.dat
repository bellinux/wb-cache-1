50|$|Starting {{from the}} many-body wavefunction, an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>approximation</b> {{is made with}} respect to the nuclear and {{electronic}} coordinates (the Born-Oppenheimer approximation). The code also makes use of Bloch's Theorem which means a wavefunction of a periodic system has a cell-periodic factor and a phase factor. The phase factor is represented by a plane wave. From the usage of Bloch's Theorem, it is ideal to write the wavefunction in plane waves for the cell-periodic factor and the phase factor. From this the basis functions are orthogonal and it is easy to perform a Fourier transform from real to reciprocal space and vice versa. Fast Fourier Transforms are used throughout the CASTEP code, as is the Ewald summation method for Coulombic energies. Along with plane waves and conjugate gradient minimisation, pseudopotentials are essential to the CASTEP code for reducing the computational expense of the calculation. Pseudopotentials replace the atomic nucleus and the core electrons by an effective numeric potential.|$|E
