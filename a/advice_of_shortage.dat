The study involves testing several statistical models using cur-rently available data to assess their accuracy and ease of use as possible bases for estimating and predicting the severity <b>of</b> nursing <b>shortages</b> in individual health care facilities. The assessments are based on criteria developed with the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> panels of experts knowledgeable about each of the four types of facilities. The results of a “preferred method ” for rating the severity <b>of</b> nursing <b>shortages</b> in counties in the United States are presented, along with key findings based on a variety of other models and analyses. Although it requires some refinement and a systematic validation, this method holds promise as a possible basis for targeting federal resources to alleviate the most critical nursing shortages across the country...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{developed}} an EOQ model, {{in which the}} demand follows a general distribution, {{under the assumption that}} lead time can be shortened and setup cost can be reduced by added investment, and backorder rate depends on inventory level and price discount in the period <b>of</b> <b>shortage.</b> We proved the existence and uniqueness of optimal solution and proposed an algorithm searching for it. We find that order quantity, safety stock and inventory total cost can be normally reduced by shortening lead time and reducing setup cost, furthermore, backordering parameter and probability <b>of</b> <b>shortage</b> have a great impact on inventory total cost, so an enterprise should do its best to reduce probability <b>of</b> <b>shortage,</b> especially when backordering parameter is small...|$|R
