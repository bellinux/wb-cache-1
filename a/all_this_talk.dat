5|$|In 1996, {{lead singer}} and guitarist Matt Hammitt met guitarist Chris Rohman {{while they were}} tenth graders {{attending}} Toledo Christian School in Ohio. They led youth worship at their school and church, and began writing their own music that year. Drummer Mark Graalman and bassist Matt Kollar soon joined, forming the band's original line-up. The group performed their first concert for several friends {{in the back of}} a warehouse in December 1996. |work=CCM Magazine |publisher=Crosswalk.com |accessdate=June 21, 2009 |author=David Jenison |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121050939/http://www.crosswalk.com/music/1275801/page2/ |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }} They released a six-track demo tape in August 1997, and a five-track EP titled <b>All</b> <b>This</b> <b>Talk</b> of Aliens in January 1998.|$|E
25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy is too strong a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, {{talk to the people}} on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this… they said if you want something, do it. You can do it. Forget <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{spending}} {{two years}} {{searching for a}} country to give him refuge, he settled in Estoril, Portugal. In an interview he gave shortly before leaving, Trifa claimed that he had [...] "happened to get put {{in a moment of}} history when some people wanted to make a point. The point was to revive the Holocaust. But <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> by the Jews about the Holocaust is going to backfire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Corruption {{remains a}} {{widespread}} issue across the member states, as [...] "tea money" [...] remains an important requirement to grease business transactions and to receive public services in Southeast Asia. Following {{the release of}} the Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 by Berlin-based graft watchdog Transparency International on 27 January, its Asia Pacific director, Srirak Plipat, noted that: [...] "if there was one common challenge to unite the Asia-Pacific region, it would be corruption", noting that: [...] "from campaign pledges to media coverage to civil society forums, corruption dominates the discussion. Yet despite <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk,</b> there's little sign of action." ...|$|E
2500|$|Millard Fillmore, the {{candidate}} of the American Party (Know-Nothings) and the Silver Gray Whigs, {{said in a speech}} at Albany, New York, that the election of a Republican candidate would dissolve the Union. Abraham Lincoln replied on July 23 in a speech at Galena, Illinois; Carl Sandburg wrote that this speech probably resembled Lincoln's Lost Speech: [...] "This Government would be very weak, indeed, if a majority, with a disciplined army and navy, and a well-filled treasury, could not preserve itself, when attacked by an unarmed, undisciplined, unorganized minority. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> about the dissolution of the Union is humbug—nothing but folly. We won't dissolve the Union, and you shan't." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Admiral chuckled. [...] "You {{are like}} one of these phonographs, Walker," [...] said he; [...] "you have had <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talked</b> into you, and now you are reeling it off again. It's rank mutiny, every word of it, for man has his duties and woman has hers, but they are as {{separate}} as their natures are.

2500|$|Following the BBC's {{decision}} not to renew Clarkson's contract with the show on 25 March 2015, Hammond's contract expired on 31 March. In April he ruled {{out the possibility of}} continuing to present Top Gear, commenting via Twitter that [...] "amidst <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> of us 'quitting' or not: there's nothing for me to 'quit' not about to quit my mates anyway". On 12 June 2015 the BBC confirmed that Top Gear will return with a 75-minute special, combining two unseen challenges featuring all three presenters from series 22, with studio links from Hammond and May. It aired in the UK on BBC Two on 28 June at 8 p.m, and in the United States on BBC America on 13 July at 9 p.m.|$|E
2500|$|On March 4 Nagin {{appeared}} {{before an audience}} of New Orleans evacuees at an event organized by the NAACP, where he made the statement that [...] "there was <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> about this being an opportunity to change New Orleans forever and maybe everybody shouldn’t come back, and maybe {{this is an opportunity}} to kind of change New Orleans and go back to what it used to be. I have 23 candidates running for mayor and very few of them look like us. [...] There's a potential to be a major change in the political structure of New Orleans." [...] Some perceived these comments to be a divisive follow-up to his [...] "Chocolate City" [...] remarks, while others point out that the fact that Nagin is the only major African-American candidate in a field of 23 is a sign of the demographic shift in a city that was over two-thirds black before Katrina.|$|E
2500|$|Martha tells Owen in the Torchwood episode [...] "Reset", {{that she}} has a boyfriend, who is {{revealed}} to be paediatric doctor Thomas Milligan in [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem", by which time the two are engaged— indicating that Martha has gotten over her love for the Doctor. In [...] "The Poison Sky" [...] she cites her relationship with Thomas Milligan as a reason to stay on Earth, rather than join Donna and Doctor in the TARDIS - saying that she's now got a great big adventure of her own to enjoy. Agyeman feels that Martha's relationship with Tom has [...] "helped cement where she is in life". Agyeman also feels that it was important for Martha's mother Francine to re-appear in [...] "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", as closure for what happened to the Jones family in Series Three: [...] "It's great for the audience to know that <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> of Martha wanting to stay on earth because of her family is for real. It's great to see Adjoa there, representing the Jones clan, even though it's a fleeting appearance. She's still very much in Martha's life".|$|E
6000|$|... "Don Ippolito," [...] said Mrs. Vervain, {{turning to}} the priest, who had been {{listening}} intently to <b>all</b> <b>this</b> trivial <b>talk,</b> [...] "what {{do you think of}} this sketch?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{press conference}} held on August 7, Rodriguez {{announced}} that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees' front office as a special advisor. [...] The club commemorated Rodriguez' final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey and a base autographed by teammates. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} year-long farewell tour given to his former Yankee teammate Derek Jeter. At the plate, he batted third and started as the DH, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter − his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016 − and departed the field to a [...] "raucous ovation" [...] from the fans. [...] The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release. On August 15, many rumors traveled around the majors. The Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media and said on behalf of Rodriguez, “I want to put <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talk</b> to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It’s not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is happy and he is going to take some time to relax and hang with his family and friends.” Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a [...]200 batting average, 9 home runs and 31 RBIs.|$|E

6000|$|<b>All</b> <b>this</b> {{confused}} <b>talk</b> about capital, however, is lucidity itself {{compared with}} the exposition of the remarkable thesis, [...] "Wages not drawn from capital, but produced by labour," [...] which occupies the third chapter of [...] "Progress and Poverty." ...|$|R

60|$|None of the {{speakers}} knew that a little {{person in the room}} above heard <b>all</b> <b>this</b> out-of-window <b>talk.</b> Charlotte, though not looking out, had left her casement open; and what reached her ears set her wondering as to the result.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I to answer, then?" [...] I {{asked with}} a very tremulous voice. Through <b>all</b> <b>this</b> sneering <b>talk,</b> I was made to feel the threat of death that {{overhung}} me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well, but if the other side destroy your people's farms, it is only by showing them that two can play at the game {{that you can make}} them observe the laws of war. I grant it would be very much better that no such thing should take place; but if the Northerners begin this sort of work they may be sure that there will be retaliation. Anyhow, I am glad that I am an officer in the 7th Virginia and not a guerrilla leader in Missouri. Well, <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>talking</b> is dry work. Has no one got a full canteen?" ...|$|R
