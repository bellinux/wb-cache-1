Moreover, the analysis requires very little time, thus satisfying the basic prerequisite for the use of this parameter as a nearly on-line indicator. The preliminary evaluation of its applicability is positive. A significant time-variability in the TOC content of fly ash collected from the first boiler hoppers is observed.
