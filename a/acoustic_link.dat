40|$|AUVs {{typically}} {{communicate with}} scientists {{on the surface}} over an unreliable acoustic channel, resulting in very low data throughput. While there are several examples of scien-tific data, even imagery, being successfully transmitted over high rate <b>acoustic</b> <b>links,</b> channel coding methods with high rates of error-correction are often employed that limit data throughput to tens or a few hundred bits per second. Little research exists into appropriate methods for image and data compression for <b>acoustic</b> <b>links</b> at these very low rates. We recently have experienced great success using compres-sion techniques based upon the Set Partitioning in Hierar-chical Trees (SPIHT) embedded coding method, and feel they are particularly suited to underwater data. In par-ticular, SPIHT provides a fully embedded coding method; truncating the encoded bitstream at any point produces the optimal encoding for that data length. This allows fine-resolution imagery to build on previously transmitted low-resolution thumbnails. For time-series data, we have devel-oped a method for quantizing data to emphasize more im-portant sections, such as the most recently collected data. In this paper we describe how these methods can be ap-plied to compress scalar environmental data and imagery for communication over <b>acoustic</b> <b>links.</b> We also the present ini-tial results of sea trials performed near Rota in the Common-wealth of Northern Marianas Islands, during which images were captured, compressed and transmitted in-situ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{challenging}} {{topic in}} the research of underwater robotics {{is the development of}} Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (IAUVs) that are controlled through an <b>acoustic</b> <b>link.</b> IAUVs should be capable to perform missions using a manipulator arm on deep-sea structures. Such missions require special capabilities like operating in a roughly known environment, which imply a certain degree of autonomy in performing the robotic tasks. A solution is to use the visual servoing at the execution level. Also, due to limitations of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>link,</b> a real video feedback is unrealistic, and thus, a direct telemanipulation (TM) from surface is excluded.

UWSNs employ acoustic communications [1 – 5]. Compared with radio transmissions in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the challenges of acoustic transmissions include (1) long propagation delay: The propagation speed for an <b>acoustic</b> <b>link</b> is 1500  m/s, 2 [*]×[*] 105 times lower than the speed of a radio link. This means the propagation delay is 2 [*]×[*] 105 times longer for an <b>acoustic</b> <b>link.</b> (2) Expensive transmitting power consumption: Power consumption for transmitting and receiving is similar in radio links. However, in acoustic links, the transmit power dominates and is typically 100 times more than the receive power. For example, in the WHOI Micro-Modem [6], the transmit power is 10  W which is 125 times of the receive power (80  mW). (3) Lower available bandwidth: Influenced by harsh environment such as transmission loss, noise, and high propagation delay, the available bandwidth is limited and depends on both range and frequency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Acoustic modems {{typically}} {{operate in}} half-duplex, which limits {{the choice of}} a data link control protocol to the Stop and Wait (S&W) type. Unfortunately, on channels with poor quality and long propagation delay–such as the majority of acoustic channels–S&W protocol has low throughput efficiency. The basic S&W can be improved by using a modification in which packets are transmitted in groups and acknowledged selectively. Throughput efficiency can now be maximized by selecting the optimal packet size, which is a function of range, rate, and error probability. Quantitative analysis for typical <b>acoustic</b> <b>links</b> shows that modified S&W protocols offer good performance, provided that packet size is chosen close to optimal. In addition, as the group size increases, sensitivity to packet size selection is reduced. To ensure best ARQ performance in mobile <b>acoustic</b> systems where <b>link</b> conditions vary with time, future generation of acoustic modems must focus on adaptive selection of protocol parameters.

We find that the underwater channel is much more complex than the air channel, and careful signal designs are needed for underwater transmissions. We have also handled another difficulty incurred by sampling rate mismatches at the transmitter and the receiver due to low-cost sampling devices.
