5|$|After making landfall, Nida {{weakened}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> more northward {{and slowed}} down. Re-entering the warmer {{waters of the}} Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high cirrostratus clouds, indicative of the weakening typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.|$|E

The main road bent south along the east {{bank of the river}} to Pugong-ni <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> {{northeast}} to Changnyong. A northern secondary road curved around marshland and lakes, the largest of which was Lake U-p'o, to Changnyong. In effect, the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to Changnyong.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) was a {{business}} loop that ran through downtown Mason. It started at an intersection on {{the southern edge of}} the city where US127 split from Hull Road to bypass downtown Mason to the west. From there, the business loop ran northward along Hull Road, becoming Jefferson Street. At the intersection with M-36 (Ash Street), Bus. US127 turned westward and ran concurrently with M-36. After four blocks and a crossing of the Sycamore Creek, Bus. US127/M-36 turned northward on Cedar Street to Columbia Avenue <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> westward along Columbia to an intersection with US127 west of downtown.|$|E
5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E

5|$|Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> against Momchil. The latter had {{exploited}} the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective no man's land between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, {{supported by a}} substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies clashed at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city. Rejecting demands by Kantakouzenos to withdraw, a clash appeared inevitable until the murder of Alexios Apokaukos in Constantinople forced Kantakouzenos to direct his attention there.|$|E
5|$|M-130 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in the southeastern corner of the US state of Michigan. It ran from a junction with US Highway23/M-50 (US23/M-50) northward across the River Raisin <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> southeasterly along North Custer Road {{on the north side}} of the river to Monroe. The highway designation was commissioned in 1929 and used until 1955. M-130 had a spur route that was created in 1938 and lasted until the main highway was removed from the state highway system. Both highways are now under local control.|$|E
5|$|The MSHD {{completed}} a major rerouting of M-66 around 1944–45. The M-14 designation {{of the time}} was decommissioned and replaced with M-66. Starting at Six Lakes, M-66 turned west along M-46 instead of east <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> south through Stanton and Ionia ending north of Battle Creek. The highway between Lowell and Lakeview was redesignated as M-91. A minor realignment in late 1950 removed two 90° curves near the Osceola–Missaukee county line {{and replaced them with}} a pair of sweeping curves.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} between 1935 and 1938, originating at SR 82 in Whetstone and heading south into Sierra Vista. From there, it turned east for a stretch <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> south following its current route to Bisbee. At this time, {{the section of}} the route corresponding to the current routing was paved, while the northern section was still a gravel road. The northern section was improved in 1942. Between 1961 and 1963, SR 90 took over the segment of SR 92 north of Sierra Vista, leaving SR 92 to the section south of the city and east to Bisbee. Since then, the routing has not been modified.|$|E
5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> {{to pursue the}} retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise and Salt Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men and threatened to blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E

The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway 23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} loop through downtown Bay City. It started {{at the intersection of}} where US23 turned off Broadway Street westward onto Lafayette Avenue. From this point, Bus. US23 ran east on Lafayette Avenue for two blocks <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> northward onto Garfield Avenue, running parallel to, but inland from, the Saginaw River into downtown Bay City. As it approached downtown, the business loop jogged off Garfield onto Washington Avenue. At the intersection with 7th Street, Bus. US23 turned westward to cross the Saginaw River. On the opposite side, the business loop followed Jenny Street westbound and Thomas Street eastbound along a one-way pairing of streets. At the intersection with US23 (Euclid Avenue), the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12) was a {{business}} route running in Niles. The western terminus was {{at the corner of}} West Chicago Road and US12 (Pulaski Highway) east of the US12/US31 interchange. From there, the business loop followed Chicago Road northeasterly through residential areas {{on the west side of}} town. Bus. US12 turned north along Lincoln Avenue and then east on Main Street, crossing the St. Joseph River. The loop intersected the southern end of M-139 at Front Street one block east of the river in downtown Niles. Four blocks further east, Bus. US12 met M-51. The two highways merged along Main Street <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> south along 11th Street at an intersection that also marks the western terminus of Bus. M-60 (Oak Street). Bus. US12/M-51 continued south along 11th Street to the corner of US12 (Pulaski Highway) and M-51 (South 11th Street) where the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until {{it became clear that}} the latter ship was out of control <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> north in an effort to get behind Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.|$|E

5|$|In late July, a trough of low pressure, which Hurricane Blanche avoided, was {{situated}} over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six at 12:00UTC on July28, while located about 60mi (100km) southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida. The depression {{combined with a}} building high pressure system, resulting {{in the development of}} a strong convergence zone. This, in turn, caused heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast, particularly in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. With sustained winds initially at 25mph (35km/h), the storm intensified slightly while tracking west-northwestward. Early on July29, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1010mbar (29.83inHg). Several hours later, it made landfall in a rural area of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, with winds of 30mph (45km/h). The system curved northwestward and dissipated at 12:00UTC on July30, shortly after crossing into Mississippi. The remnants continued into northern Louisiana <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> northward, before dissipating over Arkansas on August3.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, Baker redeveloped {{a center}} over the Caribbean Sea off {{southern}} Cuba, and re-intensified to tropical storm status. On August 27, Baker affected the Pinar del Río Province with 60mph (75km/h) winds, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> northward over the southern Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, Baker re-strengthened to hurricane intensity; reconnaissance and ship reports suggest the hurricane attained a second peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h) on August 30. The minimum central pressure was 979 mbar (28.92 inHg) on this date. The cyclone diminished in intensity prior to landfall. On August 31, the hurricane struck Gulf Shores, Alabama as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds estimated near 85mph (140km/h). The estimated central pressure at landfall was 980 mbar (28.95 inHg). Baker moved inland over Alabama and dissipated over southeastern Missouri on September 1.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, {{another group}} of MiG-15s {{attacked}} Davis during a morning patrol near Yongwon. Davis destroyed one MiG, and as a second MiG attempted to target his wingman, Davis outmaneuvered it and shot it down. At {{the end of the}} patrol, Davis had amassed 10 victories, making him the first double ace of the war. During an afternoon patrol commanding twenty-two F-86's, Davis spotted fifty MiGs in the Sunchun, South Korea area heading further south towards the Taechon area. He surprised and destroyed one MiG, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> on another in an aggressive attack which forced the MiG pilot to bail out. After 30 combat missions in Korea, Davis had 12 victories.|$|E
