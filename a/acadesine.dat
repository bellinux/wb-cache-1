Methods and Results—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human peripheral blood monocytes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide to induce TF expression. Pretreatment with <b>acadesine</b> dramatically suppressed the clotting activity and expression of TF (protein and mRNA). These inhibitory effects of <b>acadesine</b> were unchanged for endothelial cells treated with ZM 241385 (a specific adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonist) or AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor compound C, and in macrophages lacking adenosine A 2 A receptor or 1 –AMP-activated protein kinase. In endothelial cells and macrophages, <b>acadesine</b> activated the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase/Akt signaling pathway, reduced the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and consequently suppressed TF expression by inhibiting the activator protein- 1 and NF-B pathways.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Acadesine</b> {{has shown}} in vitro to {{selectively}} induce apoptosis in B cells from {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) patients. We conducted a phase I/II open-label clinical study, to determine the safety and tolerability of <b>acadesine</b> given intravenously as a 4 -h infusion to CLL patients. METHODS: Patient population included CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease who had received one or more prior lines of treatment including either a fludarabine or an alkylator-based regimen. Twenty-four patients were included: eighteen in Part I treated at single doses of 50 - 315  mg/kg, and six in Part II, three with two doses at 210  mg/kg and three with five doses at 210  mg/kg. RESULTS: A manageable and predictable safety profile was demonstrated for <b>acadesine</b> at single doses between 50 and 210  mg/kg; 210  mg/kg was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal biological dose (OBD). Grade ≥ 2 hyperuricemia occurred commonly but was not clinically significant and resolved with the administration of prophylactic allopurinol. Other adverse events included transient anemia and/or thrombocytopenia (not clinically significant), renal impairment, and transient infusion-related hypotension (clinically significant). Trends of efficacy such as a reduction of peripheral CLL cells and reduction in lymphadenopathy were observed; however, the results were variable due to the small population {{and the range of}} doses tested.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the safety and {{efficacy}} of the adenosine regulating agent (ARA) <b>acadesine</b> for reducing long-term mortality among patients with post-reperfusion myocardial infarction (MI). BackgroundNo prospectively applied therapy exists that improves long-term survival after MI associated with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery—a robust model of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Pretreatment with the purine nucleoside autocoid adenosine mitigates the extent of post-ischemic reperfusion injury in animal models. Therefore, we questioned whether use of the ARA acadesine—by increasing interstitial adenosine concentrations in ischemic tissue—would improve long-term survival after post-reperfusion MI. MethodsAt 54 institutions, 2, 698 patients undergoing CABG surgery were randomized to receive placebo (n = 1, 346) or <b>acadesine</b> (n = 1, 352) by intravenous infusion (0. 1 mg/kg/min; 7 h) and in cardioplegia solution (placebo or acadesine; 5 μg/ml). Myocardial infarction was prospectively defined as: 1) new Q-wave and MB isoform of creatine kinase (CK-MB) elevation (daily electrocardiography; 16 serial CK-MB measurements); or 2) autopsy evidence. Vital status was assessed over 2 years, and outcomes were adjudicated centrally. ResultsPerioperative MI occurred in 100 patients (3. 7 %), conferring a 4. 2 -fold increase in 2 -year mortality (p < 0. 001) compared with those not suffering MI. <b>Acadesine</b> treatment, however, reduced that mortality by 4. 3 -fold, from 27. 8 % (15 of 54; placebo) to 6. 5 % (3 of 46; <b>acadesine)</b> (p = 0. 006), with the principal benefit occurring over the first 30 days after MI.

40|$|ObjectivesThe study {{objective}} was to identify the predictors of outcomes in a contemporary cohort of patients from the Reduction in cardiovascular Events by <b>acaDesine</b> in patients undergoing CABG (RED-CABG) trial. Despite the increasing risk profile of patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting, morbidity and mortality have remained low, and identification of the current predictors of adverse outcomes may permit new treatments to further improve outcomes. MethodsThe RED-CABG trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that determined that <b>acadesine</b> did not reduce adverse events in moderately high-risk patients undergoing nonemergency coronary artery bypass grafting. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal stroke, or the need for mechanical support for severe left ventricular dysfunction through postoperative day 28. Logistic regression modeling with stepwise variable selection identified which prespecified baseline characteristics {{were associated with the}} primary outcome. A second logistic model included intraoperative variables as potential covariates. ResultsThe 4 independent preoperative risk factors predictive of the composite end point were (1) a history of heart failure (odds ratio, 2. 9); (2) increasing age (odds ratio, 1. 033 per decade); (3) a history of peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio, 1. 6); and (4) receiving aspirin before coronary artery bypass grafting (odds ratio, 0. 5), which was protective. The duration of the cardiopulmonary bypass (odds ratio, 1. 8) was the only intraoperative variable that contributed to adverse outcomes. ConclusionsPatients who had heart failure and preserved systolic function had a similar high risk of adverse outcomes as those with low ejection fractions, and new approaches may mitigate this risk.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to modulate cytoskeleton and could mediate endothelial permeability. Our hypothesis is that AMPK controls sepsis-induced hyperpermeability in the heart and is involved in septic cardiomyopathy. Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of liposaccharide, 10 mg/kg (LPS). Alpha- 1 AMPK knockout mice (α 1 KO) were compared with wild-type. Vascular permeability was characterized by Evans blue extravasation. Inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression was determined by qPCR analysis. Left ventricular mass was assessed by echocardiography. In addition, to emphasize the beneficial role of AMPK on heart vascular permeability, AMPK activator (<b>acadesine)</b> was administered to C 57 Bl 6 mice before LPS injection. The ANOVA test with Bonferroni's post hoc test and the log-rank test were used. P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Increased cardiac vascular permeability was observed in the LPS group in comparison to untreated animals (2. 5 % vs. 16 %; P < 0. 05). The α 1 KO mice exhibited an increase vascular permeability after LPS injection in comparison to wild-type mice (41. 5 % vs. 16 %; P < 0. 05). α 1 KO animals had a significant mortality increase after LPS injection (70 % vs. 10 %; P < 0. 05). LPS markedly induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL- 1 β, IL- 6) that were significantly higher in the α 1 KO animals. More importantly, LPS treatment leads to an increased left ventricular mass in the α 1 KO mice within 24 hours, suggesting the onset of edema. Finally LPS-induced vascular hyperpermeability was greatly reduced after AMPK activation by <b>acadesine</b> (13. 2 % vs. 40 %; P < 0. 05).

40|$|Although {{commonly}} used to control a variety of inflammatory diseases, the mechanism of action of a low dose of methotrexate remains a mystery. Methotrexate accumulates intracellularly where it may interfere with purine metabolism. Therefore, we determined whether a 48 -hr pretreatment with methotrexate affected adenosine release from [14 C]adenine-labeled human fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells. Methotrexate significantly increased adenosine release by fibroblasts from 4 +/- 1 % to 31 +/- 6 % of total purine released (EC 50, 1 nM) and by endothelial cells from 24 +/- 4 % to 42 +/- 7 %. Methotrexate-enhanced adenosine release from fibroblasts was further increased to 51 +/- 4 % (EC 50, 6 nM) and from endothelial cells was increased to 58 +/- 5 % of total purine released by exposure to stimulated (fMet-Leu-Phe at 0. 1 microM) neutrophils. The effect of methotrexate on adenosine release was not due to cytotoxicity since cells treated with maximal concentrations of methotrexate took up [14 C]adenine and released 14 C-labeled purine (a measure of cell injury) in a manner identical to control cells. Methotrexate treatment of fibroblasts dramatically inhibited adherence to fibroblasts by both unstimulated neutrophils (IC 50, 9 nM) and stimulated neutrophils (IC 50, 13 nM). Methotrexate treatment inhibited neutrophil adherence by enhancing adenosine release from fibroblasts since digestion of extracellular adenosine by added adenosine deaminase completely abrogated the effect of methotrexate on neutrophil adherence without, itself, affecting adherence. One hypothesis that explains the effect of methotrexate on adenosine release is that, by inhibition of 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase, methotrexate induces the accumulation of AICAR, the nucleoside precursor of which (5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleoside referred to hereafter as <b>acadesine)</b> has previously been shown to cause adenosine release from ischemic cardiac tissue. We found that <b>acadesine</b> also promotes adenosine release from and inhibits neutrophil adherence to connective tissue cells.

Very {{little is known about the}} potential effects of hypaphorine from Vaccariae seed on inflammatory response in endothelial cells. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of Vaccariae hypaphorine (VH) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -challenged endothelial EA. hy 926 cells. The inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) and vascular cellular adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) were measured by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The expressions of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) were detected by Western blotting or immunofluorescence. Results: We showed that LPS stimulated the expressions of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, MCP- 1, VCAM- 1 and TLR 4, but attenuated the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC as well as PPARγ protein levels, which were reversed by VH pretreatment. Moreover, we observed that LPS-upregulated TLR 4 protein expressions were inhibited by PPARγ agonist pioglitazone, and the downregulated PPARγ expressions in response to LPS were partially restored by knockdown of TLR 4. The negative regulation loop between TLR 4 and PPARγ response to LPS was modulated by AMPK agonist AICAR (5 -Aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide riboside or <b>acadesine)</b> or A 769662.

40|$|AMPK (5 ' AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} or 5 ' {{adenosine}} monophosphate-activated protein kinase) is an enzyme that {{plays a key}} role in cellular energy homeostasis. It consists of three subunits that together make a functional enzyme. It is expressed in a number of tissues, including liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. The ultimate effect of AMPK activation is the stimulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, triglyceride synthesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis, stimulation of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, muscle glucose uptake and modulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. Mammalian AMPK is activated by binding to AMP, but this activation is inhibited by ATP with a ratio 1 : 3. Because cellular ADP/ATP ratios remain nearly constant due to the equilibrium maintained by adenylate kinase, it is thought that AMPK activity in vivo depends primarily on the ATP/AMP ratio, the primary determinant of cellular energy charge. Lowered cellular energy charge can arise either from inhibition of ATP synthesis, for example, in hypoxia, or by increased ATP consumption, as happens in skeletal muscle during exercise. When energy charge is low, active AMPK inhibits numerous ATP consuming pathways and also activates mobilization of intracellular energy stores to produce ATP. On the contrary, when energy charge is high, AMPK inactivation is favored, leading to enhancement of energy storage and use. AMPK also functions in organism-level energy homeostasis by responding to systemically circulating hormones, including leptin, adiponectin, and resistin.

The present studies used the heterotopically transplanted rat heart to assess the protective properties of two new <b>acadesine</b> analogs: GP- 1 - 468 and GP- 1 - 668. Methods and results. Hearts were excised, arrested with a 2 -minute infusion of cardioplegic solution, and subjected to 4 hours of global ischemia (20 ° C) with cardioplegic reinfusion for 2 minutes every 30 minutes. The hearts were then transplanted (1 hour of additional ischemia) into the abdomens of recipient rats and reperfused in situ for 30 minutes or 24 hours. The hearts were then excised, perfused aerobically for 20 minutes, and contractile function was assessed. GP- 1 - 468 or GP- 1 - 668 was administered to donor rats (20 mg/kg intravenously, 30 minutes before excision). They were also added to the cardioplegic solution (10 μmol/L for GP- 1 - 468, 5 μmol/L for GP- 1 - 343, the active metabolite of GP- 1 - 668) and were also given to recipient rats (20 mg/kg intravenously, 30 minutes before transplantation, so that the drugs were present during reperfusion). Nine groups of hearts were studied. Three groups of studies were carried out (n = 24 transplants for each group). The first group of hearts was reperfused for 30 minutes, the second group was reperfused for 24 hours, and the third group was transplanted but not reperfused; instead, they were frozen at the end of 5 hours of ischemia and taken for metabolite analysis. Within each group were three subgroups (n = 8 per group) receiving GP- 1 - 468, GP- 1 - 668, or saline solution. In the 30 -minute reperfusion group the recoveries of left ventricular developed pressure were 88 ± 4, 87 ± 7, and 50 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively (p < 0. 05 versus saline-treated controls); left ventricular volumes (recorded at 12 mm Hg) were 112 ± 20, 132 ± 28, and 41 ± 9 μl, respectively (p < 0. 05 versus saline-treated controls), and coronary flows were 13. 1 ± 0. 7, 13. 4 ± 1. 0, and 9. 9 ± 0. 5 ml/min, respectively (p < 0. 05 versus saline-treated controls). In addition to improving functional recovery, the two analogs increased the tissue content of adenosine {{at the end of the}} ischemic period (5. 4 ± 0. 6 and 7. 3 ± 0. 5 μmol/gm dry weight, respectively, versus 2. 7 ± 0. 4 μmol/gm dry weight in the saline-treated controls; p < 0. 05); however, they did not influence adenosine triphosphate or its catabolites. In the 24 -hour reperfusion group the corresponding values were 77 ± 6 and 88 ± 6 versus 35 ± 4 mm Hg for left ventricular developed pressure (p < 0. 05), 111 ± 9 and 121 ± 11 versus 41 ± 8 μl for left ventricular volume (p < 0. 05), and 13. 7 ± 0. 7 and 13. 0 ± 0. 6 versus 11. 7 ± 0. 7 ml/min for coronary flow (no significant difference). Thus both analogs afforded an early and comparable degree of protection of contractile function that was sustained even after 24 hours of reperfusion. Conclusions. Both GP- 1 - 468 and GP- 1 - 668 increase the rate and extent of early postischemic recovery, and this protection is sustained for at least 24 hours. These beneficial actions were associated with an increase of the tissue content of adenosine during ischemia, but they appeared to be independent of the status of the high-energy metabolism.

40|$|Inflammatory bowel {{diseases}} (IBDs) are severe chronic pathologies {{characterized by}} {{a wide range of}} gastrointestinal and extra-digestive symptoms. The identification of novel drugs for treatment of IBDs represents an area of interest and active investigation, since currently available therapeutic options do not ensure adequate improvement/remission of the disease or induce severe adverse reactions in a significant proportion of patients. In this regard, increasing evidence suggests the adenosine system as an attractive target for the development of novel drugs against gut inflammation. Adenosine is thus released in the proximity of immune cells in tissues subjected to various forms of injurious stimuli, including ischemia and inflammation. In the majority of experimental systems, the immunosuppressive effect of adenosine results from the occupancy of its receptors expressed on various immune cell populations (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells). In addition, it has been showed that the removal of endogenous adenosine signaling exacerbates immune activation, and consequently aggravates tissue dysfunction following acute injurious stimuli. However, beside the clinical benefits that adenosine may provide on bowel inflammation, the narrow therapeutic index and/or the lack of receptor selectivity of the endogenous nucleoside account for the occurrence of adverse effects on the cardiovascular (tachycardia and hypotension) as well as central nervous system. In this regard, efforts are focusing on the search of new drugs able to increase the endogenous concentration of adenosine at the site of inflammation, either indirectly or directly through the local stimulation of its receptors {{in order to avoid the}} systemic side effects associated with the actions of adenosine on the periphery. In this study the expression of adenosine deaminase in the inflamed colon, the effects of adenosine deaminase inhibitors on established colitis and the recruitment of adenosine receptors by endogenous adenosine following adenosine deaminase blockade were investigated. Moreover, <b>acadesine</b> (ACA), an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), has been shown to act in a site- and event-specific manner against inflammation, through the local increment of endogenous adenosine levels. The effects of this compound were tested on rats with colitis induced by DNBS. Finally, the effects of PSB 0777, a novel and scarcely absorbable A 2 A receptor agonist, were examined in a rat model of experimental colitis induced by oxazolone...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of my thesis is {{the design and}} synthesis of novel benzofuran derivatives for the modulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase enzyme, or AMPK for short. This enzyme is central in the regulation of energy homeostasis in the cell and the whole body (1) not only in man but throughout the animal kingdom(2). AMPK {{is a member of}} the Serine/Threonine kinase family of transferase enzymes and is comprised of three subunits termed α, β and γ. The α subunit is the kinase portion of the enzyme while the β and γ subunits are the regulatory domains. Crucial to the activation of AMPK are the CBS domains in the γ subunit which bind the three adenosine nucleotides AMP, ADP and ATP and thus sense the energy status of the cell. Binding of ATP signals that the cell is energy replete whilst increased concentrations of AMP and its subsequent binding to the γ subunit signal the depletion of energy reserves and cause the allosteric activation of AMPK. Another method of activation of the enzyme is the phosphorylation of Thr 172 in the α subunit which is carried out by LKB 1, CaMKK 2 and TAK 1 (3). Once activated the enzyme proceeds to phosphorylate a number of other enzymes with the overall effect of blocking energy consuming pathways and enabling energy producing ones. For example it inhibits the synthesis of new fatty acids (FAs), cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs), and activates FA uptake and β-oxidation (FAO); inhibits protein synthesis(4) and glycogen synthesis while stimulating glycolisis. Interestingly its role applies to whole body energy regulation as well by being expressed in the hypothalamus and subject to hormonal control where in general hormones associated with an overfed state (such as insulin and leptin) inhibit AMPK, whilst those associated with an under-fed state (such as ghrelin and adiponectin) activate it. (5) For the reasons stated above AMPK makes an interesting target for the treatment of a plethora of diseases including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancer and even inflammation, as it appears to be a key element in the activation of the immune systems responses(6). Currently, AMPK is the focus of intensive drug discovery projects which have brought to the identification of several activators, which range from natural plant products to metformin, though the vast majority of these appear to be indirect activators. Among the true activators the 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide riboside, known as AICAR or <b>acadesine,</b> is unique in that it acts by binding with the γ subunit in place of AMP whereas other optimization studies have focused on allosteric activators acting on the β subunit. (7) We focused on the optimization of the nucleosidic structure and chose the 3 -aminobenzofuran- 2 -carboxamide ring as a close structural match as our base structure then proceeded to investigate a series of 5 -substituted derivatives. These derivatives were mainly obtained through Heck or Suzuki reactions and subsequent purification via column chromatography or crystallization. Samples of these products will then be tested for their functional activity in vitro to test their ability to activate the AMPK enzyme and in vivo in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease.
