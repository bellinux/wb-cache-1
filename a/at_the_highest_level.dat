5|$|Wright is {{currently}} rated {{as one of}} the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive realism in his portraiture.

Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today.|$|E

Augustine, who was from North Africa, several times mentions Punic; he observed that it was related to Hebrew and Syriac, and his knowledge of Punic helped him figure out transliterated Semitic words from the Bible.|$|E

Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, {{and the head of the}} British Mission.|$|E

The University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University average well over 50,000 fans attending their football games, and Oklahoma's football program ranked 12th in attendance among American colleges in 2010, with an average of 84,738 people attending its home games. The two universities meet several times each year in rivalry matches known as the Bedlam Series, which are some of the greatest sporting draws to the state. Sports Illustrated magazine rates Oklahoma and Oklahoma State among the top colleges for athletics in the nation.|$|E
5|$|For the 2008–09 season, Team Bath played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> they {{achieved}} in their history.

Towards {{the end of the}} season, the Football Conference notified Team Bath that as they were not a limited company they would be ineligible for further promotions, and would no longer be allowed to compete in the FA Cup; the club opted to resign from the Conference {{at the end of the}} season rather than restructure. Team Bath had at the time been discussing the possibility of a merger with Bath City, with the aim of getting the merged team into the Football League.|$|E

5|$|Gaelic football, hurling and {{handball}} are {{the best-known}} of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games {{are governed by}} the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), {{with the exception of}} ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500 capacity Croke Park in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played there. All GAA players, even <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level,</b> are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.|$|E
5|$|In May 1938, Bush {{accepted}} a prestigious appointment {{as president of}} the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW), which had been founded in Washington, D.C. Also known as the Carnegie Institution for Science, it had an endowment of $33 million, and annually spent $1.5 million in research, most of which was carried out at its eight major laboratories. Bush became its president on January 1, 1939, with a salary of $25,000. He was now able to influence research policy in the United States <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level,</b> and could informally advise the government on scientific matters. Bush soon discovered that the CIW had serious financial problems, and he had to ask the Carnegie Corporation for additional funding.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E
