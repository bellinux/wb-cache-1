5|$|Climate change {{caused by}} human {{activities}} that emit greenhouse gases into the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> expected {{to affect the}} frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, extreme temperatures, flooding, high winds, and severe storms.|$|E
5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, proportional to the pressure increase. Ambient <b>air</b> <b>is</b> typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E

60|$|There {{was not a}} sigh of wind. The <b>air</b> <b>was</b> drowsy {{with its}} weight of perfume. It was a {{sweetness}} {{that would have been}} cloying had the <b>air</b> <b>been</b> heavy and humid. But the <b>air</b> <b>was</b> sharp and thin.

5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all <b>air</b> <b>is</b> expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} <b>air</b> <b>is</b> called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{permitted}} depth {{for use of}} <b>air</b> <b>is</b> 60m. The {{data for}} the decompression depths of 62m and 65m {{are included in the}} table in case of accidentally exceeding the depth limit of 60m.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} if the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> cooler than the reference temperature. If the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E

5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in <b>air</b> <b>is</b> also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of <b>air</b> <b>is</b> to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which <b>air</b> <b>is</b> first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe {{by means of a}} pump action in which <b>air</b> <b>is</b> first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin.|$|E

5|$|Argon {{constitutes}} 0.934% {{by volume}} and 1.288% by {{mass of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and <b>air</b> <b>is</b> the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing <b>air</b> <b>is</b> made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Breathing <b>air</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. <b>Air</b> <b>is</b> trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that <b>air</b> <b>is</b> continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending <b>air</b> <b>is</b> dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
