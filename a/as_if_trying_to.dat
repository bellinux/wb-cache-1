5|$|The {{northern}} {{entrance to}} the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the vyaktavyakta concept of Samkhya, where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap {{out of the cave}} walls towards the spectator <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> listen for each other.|$|E
25|$|If Agnes is the fulcrum, then Tobias is {{the energy}} behind the fulcrum that works at keeping a balance in this {{dysfunctional}} family. He is constantly {{asking people to}} talk more kindly about one another. Or, in the least, it is Tobias who keeps silent while fury flares around him. It is also Tobias who serves everyone drinks, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> soften the edges of their grievances with alcohol.|$|E
60|$|He {{felt her}} searching {{him with her}} eyes, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> desperately <b>to</b> find {{something}} she might bestow upon or do for him.|$|R

25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E
2500|$|Play {{continues}} {{until one}} of the players has played all the dominoes in his or her hand, calls [...] "Out!", [...] "I win", or [...] "Domino!" [...] and wins the hand, or until all players are blocked and no legal plays remain. This is sometimes referred to as locked down or sewed up. In a common version of the game, the next player after the block picks up all the dominoes in the bone yard <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find a (nonexistent) match. If all the players are blocked, or locked out, the player with the lowest hand (pip count) wins. In team play, the team with the lowest individual hand wins. In the case of a tie, the first of tied players or the first team in the play rotation wins.|$|E
2500|$|Xavier Thaxton, {{protagonist of}} Count Geiger's Blues: A Comedy (Tor Books, 1992), is {{the fine arts}} editor for a {{newspaper}} in the fictional Southern metropolis of Salonika (a satirical/alternate reality version of contemporary Atlanta) with a particularly low opinion of pop culture. [...] When he is accidentally exposed to illegally dumped nuclear waste, the radiation exposure turns him into a superhero (or, as Bishop has designated, a [...] "stalwart"). Analog reviewer Tom Easton writes about the novel's resolution: [...] "This is where Bishop falters. The satire he has painstakingly [...] created now teeters {{on the brink of}} farce. He quite properly makes the decision to yank it back from that brink, but then he loses the satire. [...] He becomes heavy-handed and obvious." [...] Faren Miller disagrees: [...] "The most ambitious comic books are no longer merely comic – may even incorporate tragedy in a critique of modern life as savage and acute, in its way, as the ferocious satire of Dante's Inferno. Count Geiger's Blues also goes beyond humor – well beyond, in its remarkable closing chapters. [...] But they build on all that has gone before. In unleashing a startling talent for comedy and a wide-ranging knowledge of pop culture in both its absurdity and its splendor, Michael Bishop has written his best book yet." [...] John Kessel writes [...] "Comedy is certainly a new tone from Bishop, and he demonstrates a talent for it…But it seems to me Bishop doesn't really want to write comedy. It's as if Bishop is running riffs on whatever wacky ideas come to hand, without much plan, holding his characters at arm's length; <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid sententiousness, he has to avoid caring – but in the end can't. The result being a loose, baggy sort of book." ...|$|E
60|$|Marston {{turned to}} Wyndham, {{but he said}} nothing. His face was set and he looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> brace himself.|$|R

6000|$|BILL. It's not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she'd <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{force me}} into it. And she's a soft little thing. Why I ever {{made such a}} sickening ass of myself, I can't think. I never meant---- ...|$|R
60|$|The kitten {{looked at}} the horse thoughtfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> decide whether he meant it or not.|$|E
60|$|The giant {{twisted his}} huge limbs, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid an answer, {{and yet not}} daring to do so.|$|E
60|$|The German seemed bewildered; he ran {{his fingers}} through his bushy hair <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} what he had said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Basil!" [...] cried my wife, [...] "that {{is cruel}} of you! You knew I was keeping {{away from that}} point, and it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make it as afflicting as you could--the whole affair." ...|$|R
40|$|A video work {{in which}} a lone woman appears as a news seller at key {{locations}} in Sheffield city centre. She holds {{a copy of the}} Sheffield Star newspaper in her hand but as she waves it in the air, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sell it to passers-by, the familiar shout of ‘Star’ is reversed so we hear her omit a faint cry of ‘art’. Through repetition, the cry which is initially perplexing, becomes a plaintive chant...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was silence}} after that. Everyone seemed absorbed {{in his own}} thoughts. Dreamy eyes gazed abstractedly in crystal goblets, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> vainly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> trace in its crimson depths the outline of an {{imperial}} sceptre. At last Caius Nepos spoke: ...|$|R
60|$|The Major {{coughed and}} resumed his seat. Uncle John stood {{looking into the}} {{darkness}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> discern the creature.|$|E

50|$|Although {{not entirely}} a mad {{scientist}} himself, Olivier certainly {{knows how to}} drive other people crazy. But, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> perhaps <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> give the teaching profession its due, Devos did allow the ever-frustrated Mr Rectitude to {{get the last word}} on many occasions.|$|R
60|$|Her {{only answer}} was to kneel {{down and put}} her arms about him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> keep death away a little longer. He {{believed}} it then, and lay so still, she looked up in a moment, fearing she knew not what.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of man, the adamah is duly {{corrupted}} with Adam's punishment of lifelong agricultural toil. This explains why God favours Abel's sacrifice of sheep to Cain's offering of the [...] "land's produce" [...] - Abel has progressed from the sin of his father, while Cain has not. The adamah is also complicit in Cain's later murder of Abel, swallowing Abel's innocent blood <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> conceal the crime. God punishes Cain by making the ground barren to him, estranging him from the adamah.|$|R

60|$|A stare of {{helpless}} disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted heads; {{then every}} man lay down again, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> erase himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{came through}} the car afterwards, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> find the girl, {{and gave me a}} keen glance. When he came back I thought him angry and disappointed. By and by I had better grounds for imagining he {{suspected}} I had helped her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has had a}} fall, but isn't hurt or frightened," [...] {{thought the}} boy, as the pretty {{creature}} rubbed her nose against his shoulder, pawed the ground, and champed her bit, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> tell him all about the disaster, whatever it was.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked for}} a minute <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{anticipate}} that day by the exercise of his reason.|$|R

60|$|He lay staring {{across at}} the wall opposite, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> believe Morel was not there. Paul felt his heart go hard and angry.|$|E
