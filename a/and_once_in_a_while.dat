We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
25|$|Water in {{a closed}} jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual {{attraction}} of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion <b>and,</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy {{to break away from}} the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, {{every once in a while}} a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.|$|E

500|$|Several {{directors}} {{associated with}} noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. Samuel Fuller's brutal, visually energetic {{films such as}} Pickup on South Street (1953) and Underworld U.S.A. (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as [...] "primitive" [...] and [...] "barbarous". Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as Gun Crazy (1950) and The Big Combo (1955). The former—whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, disguised by a front—features a bank hold-up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential. The Big Combo was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits. The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson (The Phenix City Story [...] and The Brothers Rico [...] ) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale. The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as Felix E. Feist (The Devil Thumbs a Ride , Tomorrow Is Another Day [...] ), has become obscure. Edgar G. Ulmer {{spent most of his}} Hollywood career working at B studios <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, Detour. Ulmer's other noirs include Strange Illusion (1945), also for PRC; Ruthless (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and Murder Is My Beat (1955), for Allied Artists.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{story and}} {{characters}} were well received. Electronic Gaming Monthly {{said it is}} [...] "rich in story and character development." [...] Game Informer and Next Generation agreed that the plot {{was one of the}} game's highlights, the former drawing comparisons to Star Wars, Star Blazers, the Old Testament, and many other Square games, making it [...] "a game every RPG fanatic must play." [...] IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, [...] "deep, complex, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered." [...] GameSpot said the story is [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "thought-provoking" [...] but said it can be [...] "a little preachy at times", but {{went on to say that}} the religious and existential themes [...] "enhance the story and [...] understanding of the game's deep characterizations". Game Revolution described the storyline as [...] "epic" [...] and [...] "fabulous" [...] with [...] "many twists and turns" [...] and a large cast of characters. RPGFan said [...] "the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG", giving it a 99% rating for the story. Retrospectively, Edge praised the plot's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the [...] "most complicated Freudian hero" [...] in video games, but said it has a [...] "flawed" [...] script and [...] "muddied" [...] translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases. Years after the game's release, Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game's plot [...] "one of the wackiest game plotlines ever", but said that it [...] "actually makes sense" [...] if the player ignores all of the sideplots. IGN, however, stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot, [...] "immersion is a key factor in Xenogears and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game." [...] Following the PSN release, RPGFan's James Quentin Clark said Xenogears has [...] "hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game," [...] giving it a 100% rating for the story.|$|E

Howard Armstrong, who is famous for blues violin, got his start with his father's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with, with band makeup including [...] "mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos. <b>And</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle." [...] Other blues players from the era's string bands include Willie Black (Whistler And His Jug Band), Joe Evans (The Two Poor Boys), Dink Brister, Jim Hill, Charles Johnson, Coley Jones (Dallas String Band), Bobby Leecan (Need More Band), Alfred Martin, Charlie McCoy (1909–1950), [...] Al Miller, Matthew Prater, and Herb Quinn.|$|E
