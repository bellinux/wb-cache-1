40|$|Museums offer {{vast amounts}} of information, but <b>a</b> <b>visitor’s</b> {{receptivity}} and time are typically limited — providing the visitor {{with the challenge of}} selecting the (subjectively) interesting exhibits to view within the time available. Mobile, context-aware computer systems offer the opportunity to improve <b>a</b> <b>visitor’s</b> experience by recommending exhibits of interest, and personalising the delivered content. A first step in this process is the prediction of <b>a</b> <b>visitor’s</b> activities and interests. In this paper we study non-intrusive, adaptive user modelling techniques that include consideration of the physical constraints of the exhibition layout. We present two collaborative models for predicting <b>a</b> <b>visitor’s</b> locations in <b>a</b> museum, and an ensemble model that combines their predictions. These models were trained and tested on a small dataset of museum visits. Our results are encouraging, with the ensemble model yielding the best performance overall...|$|R
