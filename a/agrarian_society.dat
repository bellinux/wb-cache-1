5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman <b>agrarian</b> <b>society</b> (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

50|$|The landowning strata {{typically}} combine government, religious, {{and military}} institutions to justify and enforce their ownership, and support elaborate patterns of consumption, slavery, serfdom, or peonage is commonly {{the lot of}} the primary producer. Rulers of <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies</b> do not manage their empire {{for the common good}} or {{in the name of the}} public interest, but as a piece of property they own and can do with as they please. Caste systems, as found in India, are much more typical of <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies</b> where lifelong agricultural routines depend upon a rigid sense of duty and discipline. The emphasis in the modern West on personal liberties and freedoms was in large part a reaction to the steep and rigid stratification of <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|R

A Confucian ritual ceremony called Seokjeondaeje is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.|$|E
25|$|The post-war {{period was}} a time of rapid {{economic}} growth and increasing social and political stability for Finland.

25|$|The {{traditional}} Korean calendar {{was based}} on the lunisolar calendar. Dates are calculated from Korea's meridian. Observances and festivals are rooted in Korean culture. The Korean lunar calendar is divided into 24 turning points (절기, jeolgi), each lasting about 15 days. The lunar calendar was the timetable for the <b>agrarian</b> <b>society</b> in the past, but is vanishing in the modern Korean lifestyle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agrarian</b> <b>societies</b> are {{especially}} noted for their extremes of social classes and rigid social mobility. As land {{is the major}} source of wealth, social hierarchy develops based on landownership and not labor. The system of stratification is characterized by three coinciding contrasts: governing class versus the masses, urban minority versus peasant majority, and literate minority versus illiterate majority. This results in two distinct subcultures the urban elite versus the peasant masses. Moreover, this means that cultural differences within <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies</b> greater the differences between them.|$|R

25|$|The finest Tagalog novelist of the {{province}} is Francisco Lazaro. His novels depicted life in an <b>agrarian</b> <b>society</b> {{that gave rise to}} the social unrest of his period (1950s and 1960s). One of his novels was serialized by Liwayway Magazine, the most popular Tagalog magazine at that time until the '70s. But unlike the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas, Lazaro advocated for the peaceful resolution of the agrarian problem, relying on the benevolence of the government and the landlords.|$|E
25|$|Upon unifying, Italy had a {{predominantly}} <b>agrarian</b> <b>society</b> as 60% {{of the active}} population worked in agriculture. Advances in technology, the sale of vast Church estates, foreign competition along with export opportunities rapidly transformed the agricultural sector in Italy shortly after unification. However, these developments did not benefit all of Italy in this period, as southern Italy's agriculture suffered from hot summers and aridity damaged crops while the presence of malaria prevented cultivation of low-lying areas along Italy's Adriatic Sea coast.|$|E
25|$|As China {{gradually}} {{evolved from}} an <b>agrarian</b> <b>society</b> to a mixed agrarian-commercial one, traditions from other festivals {{began to be}} transmitted into the Mid-Autumn Festival, such as the putting of lanterns on rivers to guide {{the spirits of the}} drowned as practiced during the Ghost Festival, which is observed a month before. Hong Kong fishermen during the Qing dynasty, for example, would put up lanterns on their boats for the Ghost Festival and keep the lanterns up until Mid-Autumn Festival.|$|E

25|$|As more {{settlers}} {{came to the}} prairies on the railway, {{the population}} grew. On September 1, 1905, Saskatchewan became a province, with inauguration day held September 4. The Dominion Lands Act permitted settlers to acquire one quarter of a square mile of land to homestead and offered an additional quarter upon establishing a homestead. Immigration peaked in 1910, {{and in spite of}} the initial difficulties of frontier life – distance from towns, sod homes, and backbreaking labour – new settlers established a European-Canadian style of prosperous <b>agrarian</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the eighteenth century, many of these {{traditional}} dances began to be performed, or referred to thematically, by a blossoming theatrical trade. Peasant or Serf Theaters entertained the subjugated native peoples of present-day Ukraine, who remained relegated to lower social classes in their own homelands, while their foreign rulers often lived lavishly in comparison, importing foreign entertainers and their dances. It is within this context that staged Ukrainian folk dances, which depicted the ideals of an <b>agrarian</b> <b>society,</b> gained even more popularity with the native population, which further developed the theater into a thriving occupation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the use of a {{standardized}} written language increased with each new innovation of communication and transportation. It was however not until the 1960s, when the major demographic situation of Sweden had changed from a quite rural and <b>agrarian</b> <b>society</b> to the highly urbanized society it is today, that the spoken varieties closed up towards unified dialects whose vocabulary and grammatical rules adhered to that of the (written) Standard Swedish. The different phonologies, particularly the different realizations of the tonal word accents, have however proved to be more variable.|$|E
50|$|These {{types are}} often {{combined}} {{in various ways}} (for example, industrializing horticultural and <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies,</b> such as Ghana and Brazil in the late 20th century) and can be usefully subdivided into more or less advanced (e.g., simple and advanced horticultural societies).|$|R

25|$|James II tried {{building}} a powerful militarised {{state on the}} mercantilist assumption that the world's wealth was necessarily finite and empires were created by taking land from other states. The East India Company was thus an ideal tool to create a vast new English imperial dominion by warring with the Dutch and the Mogul Empire in India. After 1689 came an alternative understanding of economics, which saw Britain as a commercial rather than an <b>agrarian</b> <b>society.</b> The proponents of this view, most famously Adam Smith in 1776, argued that wealth was created by human endeavour and was thus potentially infinite.|$|E
25|$|Smaller domesticable {{animals such as}} dogs, cats, chickens, and {{guinea pigs}} may be {{valuable}} in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain large-scale <b>agrarian</b> <b>society.</b> An important example {{is the use of}} larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have {{an important role in the}} transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.|$|E
25|$|Such {{violence}} did {{not enter}} the region until the invasion of tribes following the Kurgan Culture in the fourth millennium BC. Until {{the invasion of the}} Kurgan peoples, the region was an <b>agrarian</b> <b>society,</b> settled and content, with no reason for the populations to become violent with one another. The invasion uprooted the sedentary tribes, and caused chaos in the area. The LBK entered an unsettled “dark age” of disunity. Violence in the area came {{as a result of this}} chaos, because unsettled tribes became belligerent as they competed with neighbors. All of this occurred hundreds of years after the death of the 34 humans at Talheim.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{they have}} {{demonstrated}} that in the <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies</b> the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.|$|R
40|$|Hunting and {{gathering}} remained the main mode of subsistence of humanity {{for hundreds of}} thousands of years, beginning some 1. 8 million years ago, and until the Neolithic Revolution (some 10, 000 years ago), when agriculture gradually spread through human societies (Marlowe 2005). Hunter-gatherer societies obtained their food directly from “natural” ecosystems, by hunting wild animals and collecting wild plants (Richerson et al. 1996). Early <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies</b> started planting desired crops on suitable lands, competing with wildlife for space and resources. As <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies</b> evolved, techniques for planting and harvesting became technologically more advanced and more efficient (Richerson et al. 1996). Innovations thus allowed the human population to grow and to colonize nearly every terrestrial ecosystem type on Earth. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
50|$|Meticulous {{studies show}} the {{destructive}} and often irreversible {{effects of the}} international development policy, mainly based on technology transfer, on <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies.</b> The consequences are: decline in productivity, food crises, rapid urbanisation, political instability, forced migrations and violent conflicts which provide the background for post-colonial state failures and social disintegration in sub-Saharan Africa.This approach contributes to the theory about the collapse of societies. It describes the interactions between the development agencies and the respective national elites and their connection to the internal dynamics of African societies.Together with Marina Padrão Temudo, he introduced the concept of resilience into {{the debate on the}} disintegration and destruction of African <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies.</b> They investigated their resilience in times of crisis, in particular their ability to accommodate war refugees over extended periods of time. In this way, they showed an alternative to the establishment of refugee camps, which are often incubators of further violence and social destruction.Since 2008, he and Ana Larcher Carvalho have been conducting research on the link between development policy, migration and Food security. In 2015 he began to research about the communication in and with African <b>agrarian</b> <b>societies.</b> Since 2017 they initiated international research on the nonadaptation of technology in African societies.|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} towards civilization is {{the move from}} nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} to rooted <b>agrarian</b> <b>society.</b> Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a climate dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for domestication and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of crops and livestock leads to food surpluses. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technologic innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop ruling classes and supporting bureaucracies, which in turn lead to the organization of nation-states and empires.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom's {{struggle}} with France during the Napoleonic wars required the British Army to expand rapidly. Ordinary recruiting methods failed {{to supply the}} number of men required to fill the Army ranks. The main methods used for recruiting were: private individuals were recruited for their own interests, volunteers from the militia and placing obligations on communities to enlist. Generals called for conscription {{for the first time in}} British History, although this was never enacted for the regular army. During this period, Great Britain was at a disadvantage to her enemy, as due to the Industrial Revolution potential recruits were instead drawn to the cities to earn more money in the many factories now being built in the country, while France was still largely an <b>agrarian</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a heavily}} <b>agrarian</b> <b>society,</b> land {{ownership}} {{played a central}} role. Germany's nobles, {{especially those in the}} East – called Junkers – dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.|$|E
