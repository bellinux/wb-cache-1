Unlike the non-3 versions of mobile Skype, [...] "Skype on 3" [...] {{does not use}} the phone's data connection for voice calls, but instead places a normal phone call to a special number which 3 make available for this service. 3 does not charge users for calls to this number. This service is available in Australia, Ireland and the UK; it has been discontinued in Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy and Sweden. A company called iSkoot (now Qualcomm iSkoot Inc.) was behind {{at least some of}} the clients and back-end servers but iSkoot announced a shutdown scheduled for 20 January 2011. It appears this shutdown initially affected the J2ME version and some Skypephones (which now show a [...] "click to upgrade" [...] link which either doesn't function or takes you to a page saying an upgrade is not available), but some S60 versions were not affected. [...] Skype have started sending emails indicating the Skype on 3 service will be terminated on 30 September 2014, in spite of Three's original [...] "free for life" [...] advertising. The recommended clients for smartphones will use the phone's data connection which may be liable to charges, instead of the dedicated <b>access</b> <b>number</b> used by the client, which was free to call.|$|E
