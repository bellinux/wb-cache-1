2500|$|The uniforms were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> {{that did}} change in 1971. The {{acquisition}} of Roger Metzger from the Chicago Cubs {{in the off-season}} moved Menke to first base and Bob Watson to the outfield. The Astros {{got off to a}} slow start and the pitching and hitting averages were down. Larry Dierker was selected to the All-Star game in 1971, but due to an arm injury he could not make it. César Cedeño led the club with 81 RBIs and the league with 40 doubles, but batted just [...]264 and had 102 strikeouts in his second season with the Astros. Pitcher J. R. Richard made his debut in September of the 1971 season against the Giants.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953 the Imperial {{model was}} renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, {{it had a}} {{different}} wheelbase, taillights, and side trim. Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the [...] "ordinary" [...] Chryslers. This {{was also the first}} year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment electric windows, electric division window, floor level courtesy lamps, rear compartment heater, fold-up footrests, seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On March 10, 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan. The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase [...] longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> new on the 1953 [...] Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders. Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system) and Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, called PowerFlite, became available late in the model year, being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns. Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one. A padded dash was standard.|$|E
