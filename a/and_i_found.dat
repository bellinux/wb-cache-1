25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found,</b> to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|Hosseini {{disclosed}} {{that in some}} ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly because when he penned The Kite Runner, [...] "no one was waiting for it." [...] He also found his second novel to be more [...] "ambitious" [...] than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, [...] "As I began to write, as the story picked up pace <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself immersed {{in the world of}} Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and enabled me to tune out the background noise and get on with the business of inhabiting the world I was creating." [...] The characters [...] "took on a life of their own" [...] at this point and [...] "became very real for [...] ".|$|E

By the time his flight arrived in London he had changed his mind, so he telephoned producer Stanley Kramer {{from the airport to}} signal his acceptance, and [...] "popped back on a plane to be fitted for the part" [...] the same day. He was not comfortable with many of the other actors on set, later commenting that [...] "I was the only non-American, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it exhausting and embarrassing because they never relaxed. They were always 'on'." [...] One of the American stars was Spencer Tracy, whom Terry-Thomas considered [...] "an extra-special man"; Tracy and Buster Keaton—who also appeared in the film—were described by Terry-Thomas as [...] "the only two people who ever produced in me this awe of greatness".|$|E

[...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where I was brought up and it was a very [...] different scene. [...] To me it was a very mystical place.

500|$|Cage {{underwent}} {{an artistic}} {{crisis in the}} early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned {{with the idea of}} art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: [...] "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer was saying simply because I had little understanding of his language. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> other people misunderstanding what I myself was saying when I was saying something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about Indian music in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was [...] "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.|$|E
500|$|The live {{performance}} for [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as part of}} 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, where it served as the closing song, was taped and premiered online on November 16, 2011. It was added on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4, which was released in late November 2011. The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} windup about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from. She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to get to where I am. I searched all around the world, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself. You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it to all of you guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E
500|$|Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times {{said that}} the program {{delivered}} what she described as a [...] "blood bath," [...] and Aaron Rutzkoff of The Wall Street Journal further analyzed that the episode followed a dark and frenetic convention [...] "with flare." [...] The Washington Post commentator Jen Chaney opined that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] evoked elements of various films of George Romero, {{as well as the}} historical epic film Gone with the Wind (1939). Writing for Paste, Josh Jackson issued the episode an 8.8 out of 10 rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. [...] "'Beside the Dying Fire' wasted no time getting straight to the action, assuming a season’s worth of character development was more than enough." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan echoed synonymous sentiments, ultimately declaring that the telecast was the best since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye." [...] Ryan summated: [...] "The first two acts of The Walking Dead Season 2 finale were full of excitement, honest to God suspense and characters who came up with pretty decent plans on the fly. When the braaaains finally hit the fan at Hershel Greene's farm, my pulse quickened <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself wondering and even caring about the survival of characters who'd done little more than irritate me for weeks."

500|$|Following {{the events}} of WrestleMania 21, the next night on Raw, Muhammad Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault Michaels. On the April 11 episode of Raw, Michaels {{approached}} authority figure Eric Bischoff, in which he demanded a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari, a match consisting of one wrestler or team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as two against one, or three against two. Bischoff refused to schedule the match, but informed Michaels to find a partner and he would grant him the match. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan {{to come back and}} team with him. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer. At Backlash, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels when Daivari was pinned. On the July 4 episode of Raw, Michaels and Hulk Hogan had a tag team match, which they won. During the post-match pose, Michaels hit Hogan with his superkick, knocking Hogan to the ground and making Michaels a villain {{for the first time since}} returning in 2002. The following week on Raw, Michaels appeared on Piper's Pit where he superkicked Roddy Piper and then challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam. Hogan defeated Michaels at SummerSlam, and after the match Michaels extended his hand to him, saying [...] "I needed to know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out" [...] and he and Hogan shook hands. Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd, and Michaels once again became a fan favorite.|$|E
500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

500|$|The role {{of adult}} Gretel, whom Wirkola {{wanted to be}} [...] "a really, really strong and fun female character," [...] was {{originally}} planned for Noomi Rapace, {{who dropped out of}} consideration for the part prior to early January 2011. [...] Diane Kruger and Eva Green were reported to also be in talks for the role. English actress Gemma Arterton was ultimately cast in the role. She impressed Wirkola with her performance in The Disappearance of Alice Creed, and, after they have met, with her [...] "really filthy sense of humour" [...] as [...] "the humour is essential to this film." [...] Arterton said she was attracted to Wirkola's [...] "strong vision" [...] for the film, calling it [...] "very, very dark, and bloodthirsty and there’s a lot of cursing. It’s kind of got a Tarantino feel, really." [...] Arterton described her character as [...] "much more in tune with her spiritual side. Hansel is a typical action hero, cheeky, funny, a womanizer. She’s much more of a thinker, intense, internal and bit more open-minded than he is." [...] She said that Gretel is [...] "a sexual character but she's not having sex with anybody, which is a change for me because usually in my films I'm sleeping with somebody!" [...] She further explained the characters: [...] "Hansel & Gretel have this unstoppable bond but they’re also so different from each other. She’s the brains of the operation. He’s the brawn. He’s the joker and the show-off. She’s more the watcher, the researcher, the one who tries to really understand witchcraft." [...] Arterton added, [...] "Jeremy [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> within the script moments where we showed the vulnerable side of them. Often in action movies, people are scared to put that in. I think it was important." [...] She said that she [...] "loved every minute" [...] of the production and did not want it to end, also crediting it for helping her overcome her fear of getting hurt.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a {{nine out of}} ten rating, and opined that the episode was a [...] "home run episode" [...] for the series. Harrison continued: [...] "Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama—just how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures." [...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if you listened close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic." [...] In conclusion, Oesterle gave [...] "Bloodletting" [...] a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a [...] "great" [...] response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that [...] "Bloodletting" [...] was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was [...] "a character strengthening episode."
