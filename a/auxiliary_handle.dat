40|$|Pseudo {{empirical}} {{likelihood ratio}} confidence intervals for finite population parameters {{are based on}} asymptotic [chi] 2 approximation to an adjusted pseudo empirical likelihood ratio statistic, with the adjustment factor related to the design effect. The calculation of the design effect involves variance estimation and hence requires second order inclusion probabilities. It also depends on how auxiliary information is used, {{and needs to be}} derived one-at-a-time for different scenarios. This paper presents bootstrap procedures for constructing pseudo empirical likelihood ratio confidence intervals. The proposed method bypasses the need for design effects and is valid under general single-stage unequal probability sampling designs with small sampling fractions. Different scenarios in using <b>auxiliary</b> information are <b>handled</b> by simply including the same type of benchmark constraints with the bootstrap procedures. Simulation results show that the bootstrap calibrated intervals perform very well and have much improved coverage probabilities over the [chi] 2 -based intervals when the sample sizes are small or moderate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept of Energy Storage System (ESS) interfacing with the grid side inverter in wind energy conversion systems. The inverter system used here is formed by cascading a 2 -level inverter and a three level inverter through a coupling transformer. The constituent inverters are named as the “main inverter” and the “auxiliary inverter” respectively. The main inverter {{is connected with}} the rectified output of the wind generator while the auxiliary inverter {{is attached to a}} Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The BESS ensures constant power dispatch to the grid irrespective of change in wind condition. Furthermore, this unique combination of BESS and inverter eliminates the need of additional dc-dc converters. Novel modulation and control techniques are proposed {{to address the problem of}} non-integer, dynamically-changing dc-link voltage ratio, which is due to random wind changes. Strategies used to <b>handle</b> <b>auxiliary</b> inverter dc-link voltage imbalances and controllers used to charge batteries at different rates are explained in detail. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed modulation and control techniques in suppressing random wind power fluctuations...|$|R
50|$|The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates were to {{have been}} {{eventually}} replaced by Littoral Combat Ships by 2019. However, the worn out frigates were being retired faster than the LCSs are being built, which {{may lead to a}} gap in United States Southern Command mission coverage. According to Navy deactivation plans, all Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates would be retired by October 2015. Simpson was the last to be retired (on 29 September 2015), leaving the Navy devoid of frigates {{for the first time since}} 1943. The ships will either be made available for sale to foreign navies or dismantled. Perry-class frigate retirement was accelerated by budget pressures, which will lead to the remaining 11 ships being replaced by only eight LCS hulls. With the timeline LCS mission packages will come online unknown, there is uncertainty if they will be able to perform the frigates' counter-narcotics and anti-submarine roles when they are gone. The Navy is looking into Military Sealift Command to see if the Joint High Speed Vessel, Mobile Landing Platform, and other <b>auxiliary</b> ships could <b>handle</b> low-end missions that the frigates performed.|$|R

The Participants, Destec Energy, Inc., (Destec) of Houston, Texas and PSI Energy, Inc., (PSI) of Plainfield, Indiana, formed the Wabash River Coal Gasification Repowering Project Joint Venture (the JV) to participate in the DOE`s Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program by demonstrating the coal gasification repowering of an existing 1950 `s vintage generating unit affected by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the biomechanical {{assessment}} of carpentry woodworkers, located in Brasília, DF. It was filmed the profile of each worker during the performance of his activities in the carpentry and the forces involved in the work were assessed. The image of each woodworker was congealed to accomplish the measurement of articulation angles. The data were submitted to the software of posture analysis “Winowas” (OWAS Method) and to the biomechanic model of posture prognosis and static forces, developed by Michigan University. The OWAS method showed that, for all machines and carpentries assessed, the worst posture occurred when the worker lifted and placed the pieces of wood on the floor and during the feeding in the smoother. The tridimensional biomechanic model registered the worst posture in different phases of the work cycle. In the first one, there were problems in all articulations, except the hips, when placing the pieces on the floor from the smoother. In the second one, there were problems in all articulations, except the elbows and the L 5 -S 1 column disc, by feeding the surface planer. The third one, the ankles were the most injured when feeding the smoother, the surface planer, the circular saw and the band saw. According to the results, the woodworkers should try to eliminate the constant work standing upright, use <b>auxiliary</b> machinery to <b>handle</b> pieces of wood, reduce the load during feeding the machines and improve postures. </p...|$|R
40|$|A new and {{efficient}} approach {{to construct a}} 3 D wire-frame of an object from its orthographic projections is described. The input projections can be two or more and can include regular and complete auxiliary views. Each view may contain linear, circular and other conic sections. The output is a 3 D wire-frame {{that is consistent with}} the input views. The approach can <b>handle</b> <b>auxiliary</b> views containing curved edges. This generality derives from a new technique to construct 3 D vertices from the input 2 D vertices (as opposed to matching coordinates that is prevalent in current art). 3 D vertices are constructed by projecting the 2 D vertices in a pair of views on the common line of the two views. The construction of 3 D edges also does not require the addition of silhouette and tangential vertices and subsequently splitting edges in the views. The concepts of complete edges and n-tuples are introduced to obviate this need. Entities corresponding to the 3 D edge in each view are first identified and the 3 D edges are then constructed from the information available with the matching 2 D edges. This allows the algorithm to handle conic sections that are not parallel to any of the viewing directions. The localization of effort in constructing 3 D edges is the source of efficiency of the construction algorithm as it does not process all potential 3 D edges. Working of the algorithm on typical drawings is illustrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{developed an}} online procedure {{to estimate the}} weaving capacity through time for a simple rampweave section, {{the most common type}} of weaving areas in the Twin Cities' freeway network. The field observations and the analysis of the traffic data collected from a sample weaving section indicate that the freeway-to-ramp and ramp-to-freeway vehicles first merge and travel together at the beginning portion of the auxiliary lane before they split to the mainline or exit ramp. The length of the shared portion of the auxiliary lane, called an "effective weaving zone," varied depending on the length of an auxiliary lane and the amount of weaving volume. The above merge-split behavior and the resulting mixed flow on the auxiliary lane for a short time period explains the fact that the maximum possible weaving volume in a simple ramp-weave section equals the maximum through volume that the <b>auxiliary</b> lane can <b>handle.</b> Researchers used a Kalman Filter to obtain estimated weaving volume data from three weaving, which supported this observation. Based on the above findings, an online procedure was developed to estimate the maximum possible weaving volume for a given ramp-weave area through time using the volume and occupancy measurements from the loop detectors. The proposed procedure assumes that the maximum possible weaving volume for a given time interval is a function of downstream traffic conditions that can be quantified by estimating the time-variant merging and diverging capacities of a given weaving section. Test results with the five-minute data from a ramp-weave site indicate that the maximum possible weaving volume can be estimated with reasonable accuracy during congested peak periods.

40|$|The {{ports of}} Haldia and Calcutta are located landinward along the Hooghly river {{respectively}} 43 and 145 kilometer from the Bay of Bengal. In this report a masterplan {{will be developed}} to concentrate the port activities of both ports in Haldia. Roughly 50 % of India's population is living in extreme poverty. The Government considers growth of the economy, resulting in a higher employment, to be of paramount importance to solve the poverty problem. In the 7 th Five Year Plan, which started in 1984, it was planned to increase the Gross Domestic Product, indicator for economic productivity, with 5 % per annum. One of the measures taken to realise {{the objectives of the}} 7 th Five Year Plan is further port development. If a ship is heading for Haldia or Calcutta it has to cross respectively 3 or 15 sandbars between the Bay of Bengal and the port, which is only possible during High water. The dept of the river and, to a lesser extent, the estuary are the most limiting factors for the draught of vessels. Both ports were constructed as impounded dock systems. Especially in Calcutta the dimensions of the locks and the available water depth in the dock restrict the size of the visiting ships. The turn around time of vessels in the port is high and mainly depends on the cargo hand ling process. The port of Calcutta can be described as a congested traditional breakbulk port. The combination of outdated quays and sheds, frequent breakdown of equipment and bad management result in an inefficient cargo handling process. Haldia was set up as an <b>auxiliary</b> port for <b>handling</b> mainly bulk cargoes. Consequently appropriate equipment and ample storage area have been provided. The area reserved for port activities in the existing masterplan allows further expansion of the port. Transport to and from the hinterland in Calcutta is hampered by the overburdened internal port- and metropolis road system. Lack of storage- and parking area are the underly ing problem in regard of the port road system. In spite of the difficult road transport the share of railway and inland waterway transport is almost negligible. In Haldia there is only one road- and railway connection with the national systems, however, liquid bulk cargo, a considerable part on the total cargo, is transported by pipeline.
