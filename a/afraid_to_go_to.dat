They have become a community of whisperers in a kingdom of fear.|$|E
25|$|The initial Arab plans {{called for}} Syrian and Lebanese forces to invade from north while Jordanian and Iraqi forces were to invade from east {{in order to}} meet at Nazareth and then to push forward {{together}} to Haifa. In the south, the Egyptians were to advance and take Tel Aviv. At the Arab League meeting in Damascus on 11–13 May, Abdullah rejected the plan, which served Syrian interests, using the fact his allies were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war without his army. He proposed that the Iraqis attack the Jezreel valley and the Arab Legion enter Ramallah and Nablus and link with the Egyptian army at Hebron, which was more in compliance with his political objective to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab State by the partition plan and promises not to invade the territory allocated to the Jewish State by the partition plan. In addition, Lebanon decided not {{to take part in the}} war at the last minute due to the still influential Christians' opposition and to Jewish bribes.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

2500|$|Amnesty International has [...] "received many {{reports of}} vigilante action against gay people {{by members of}} the community, and of ill-treatment or torture by the police. Gay men and lesbian women have been beaten, cut, burned, raped and shot on account of their sexuality. ... We are {{concerned}} that these reports are {{just the tip of the}} iceberg. Many gay men and women in Jamaica are too <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the authorities and seek help." [...] This violence has prompted many gay persons to emigrate and hundreds of LGBT Jamaicans to seek asylum in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he tries}} to ignore Kenny, calling the list item [...] "special circumstances", Earl is shortly {{thereafter}} attacked by Joy and realizes: there are no special circumstances. He returns to Kenny's house and asks why Kenny doesn't have a man. Kenny answers that nobody knows he is gay, and he is <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a gay bar. [...] Earl agrees to come with him, to give him needed support and cross Kenny off his list. They go with Randy to a gay bar, where Kenny builds up the confidence {{to talk to a}} man. Acknowledging the cathartic irony of being accepted for who he is by the man he once feared the most, he thanks Earl and says he can cross him off his list.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 30, 2002 {{editorial}} for the Gazette, retired West Virginia State College economist Aaron Metz {{identified two}} issues {{arising from the}} affair; {{freedom of speech and}} [...] "freedom from fear", writing [...] "Freedom of speech suffers in an environment of fear. Katie was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school because law and order ceased to exist there." [...] Metz observed that the story had caught the attention of Poles, some of whom wanted Sierra to come and study in their country, and to the Japanese, whose response he called [...] "more irrational", saying they [...] "didn't want her; they just wanted to get that T-shirt in their hands" [...] and were [...] "making fun of West Virginia, a state 50th in education, for expelling a good student - a sort of sideshow using Katie and her T-shirt on TV for entertainment". In the context of adult control of adolescent expression, a December 2003 editorial in the Gazette wrote that the Sissonville High's administrators [...] "overreacted" [...] in Sierra's case, feeding a backlash against the student instead of [...] "taking advantage of her youthful energy and curiosity to craft meaningful civics lessons".|$|E

6000|$|He went as I bade him, {{and coming}} back presently, told me that a party of Basutos, about thirty in number, who were {{returning}} from Kimberley, {{where they had been}} at work in the mines, under the leadership of a Bastard named Karl, asked leave to camp by the wagon for the night, as they were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on <b>to</b> [...] "Tampel" [...] in the dark.|$|R

6000|$|A {{visit to}} Germany is a tonic to an Englishman. We English are always sneering at ourselves, and patriotism in England is {{regarded}} as a stamp of vulgarity.

5000|$|News of this miracle spread quickly, and everyone, even Muslims, {{began to}} call John a [...] "Wali" [...] - a [...] "saint".

Of course I would {{go on with the}} adventure, if adventure it might be called, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> sailing around Cape Horn with a shipload of fools and lunatics--and worse; for I remembered the three Babylonish and Semitic ones who had aroused Mr. Pike's ire and who had laughed so terribly and silently.|$|R
50|$|In the cave, Nico soon arrives, {{deciding}} {{to see his}} father one last time. They blame each other for Cassus' abandoning him, and Nico clearly resents him. He changes his way though, and begins to talk Nico out of living a life similar to his. During this, he finally breaks down and confesses. Cassus says he didn't mean to kill everyone, but was interrupted during a robbery and <b>went</b> crazy, <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> jail. He finally admits his cowardice in life, asks for forgiveness, and dies with his son by his side. Lyna is waiting just outside, where Hercules tells her Cassus is dead.
