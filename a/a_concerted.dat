5|$|Examples of extortionate {{ransomware}} became {{prominent in}} May 2005. By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected. Using a 1024-bit RSA key, {{it was believed}} {{large enough to be}} computationally infeasible to break without <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> distributed effort.|$|E
5|$|After the {{revolution}} broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of {{what became the}} Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion {{was in favor of}} it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> action by Western powers. Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in {{the capital}} that the French were behind a plan to install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam. Helping Khánh in <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> smear campaign were Khiêm and Thieu. The French Foreign Office had announced that Paris would establish diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Khánh used {{this as an opportunity}} to play on American anti-neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The Fat Man implosion-type weapon was developed in <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Other species also migrate shorter {{distances}} {{away from}} the breeding sites, their distribution at sea determined by the availability of food. If oceanic conditions are unsuitable, seabirds will emigrate to more productive areas, sometimes permanently if the bird is young. After fledging, juvenile birds often disperse further than adults, and to different areas, so are commonly sighted far from a species' normal range. Some species, such as the auks, do not have <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> migration effort, but drift southwards as the winter approaches. Other species, such {{as some of the}} storm petrels, diving petrels and cormorants, never disperse at all, staying near their breeding colonies year round.|$|E
5|$|The Referendum Party {{decided not}} to contest any of the by-elections {{that took place in}} 1996 and 1997. For the 1997 general election, it hurried its {{selection}} of candidates, who had only one interview—and no background checks or screening—before acceptance. The funding for each candidate's official campaign was supplied entirely by the party centre. Candidates were brought to a training day at a Manchester hotel in February 1997, where they were presented with several hours of speeches and given a handbook. Many felt that the event had been a public relations exercise rather than <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> effort to train candidates.|$|E

5|$|While Charles and Moreau jockeyed for {{position}} on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, Franz Petrasch engaged the French at Bruchsal. The troops there, commanded by Marc Amand Élisée Scherb, included the 68th Demi-brigade and two squadrons of the 19th Dragoons; they had remained behind after the Battle of Ettlingen to observe the garrisons of Mannheim and Philippsburg. Realizing that his command {{was too small to}} withstand <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> attack by the stronger Austrians, Scherb withdrew toward Kehl to secure the Rhine crossing to Strasburg, since Moreau, now well into a retreat across the mountains, would need the crossing for a safe passage to France.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to make contact with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E
5|$|D'Oliveira {{was aware}} of the {{political}} discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 not out and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the fighting around Finschhafen and the defeat of the Japanese counterattack, the Allies began preparing for <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> assault on the Japanese main defensive position around Sattelberg. In the wake of the Japanese counterattack, the members of the Australian and American staff began working more closely together and reinforcements were quickly approved {{in the form of the}} 26th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier David Whitehead, as well as a squadron of Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion– whose presence the Australians sought to keep secret for as long as possible– which were landed at Langemak Bay. Supplies were landed by US troops from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, and then brought up and cached around Jivevaneng and Kumawa, but heavy rain hampered the Australian efforts until mid-November.|$|E
5|$|In 1452, Turkish cavalry {{forces had}} begun raiding Albanian territories in the East, a common Ottoman tactic to weaken an enemy before {{beginning}} a full-scale invasion. On 23 April, Raimon d'Ortafà, Alfonso's governor in Albania, {{feared that the}} Turkish invasion would force many of the Albanians to turn to Islam and sent letters to Alfonso for aid. Mehmed, believing that the misunderstandings between the Albanian leaders was at its most critical point, ordered a force of 25,000-27,000 inexperienced men. His reasoning was that these could weaken Albanian forces enough {{so that he could}} then launch <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> invasion. The force was under the main command of Tahip Pasha. Tahip would split his forces into two parts, one under his command, and the other under his subordinate, Hamza Pasha. Mehmed had been tied up in war in the East so he let Hamza ride back to the West.|$|E
5|$|In 1774, the {{government}} of Prince Edward Island passed the Quit Rent Act 1774 to force the proprietors to pay their dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to simply not pay their quitrent. In 1781, {{the government}}, led by Governor Walter Patterson, compulsorily acquired {{approximately half of the}} island using a process known as escheat. That same year, the government held a public auction to sell off the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested that Governor Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was a spike {{in the number of}} suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> effort to cripple the government.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{creating}} a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, {{in and around the}} city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom {{in creating}} effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the town}} walls grew and in the 19th century one of the towers was {{restored}} {{and part of the}} wall-walk opened up for tourists. The walls were architecturally surveyed for the first time between 1928 and 1930, with the results published in 1938. The town walls were leased from Conwy's local authority by the Ministry of Works in 1953, and <b>a</b> <b>concerted</b> effort began to conserve and protect the fortifications. Many of the houses and buildings which had grown up against the walls since the 14th century were removed in an effort to improve the appearance of the walled circuit and to assist in conservation and archaeological work, and one of the 19th-century gateways inserted by Telford was demolished in 1958. Arnold J. Taylor, a prominent historian of the Edwardian castles, conducted extensive academic work on the history and architecture of Conwy's walls during the 1950s and 1960s, adding to their prominence.|$|E
