There are roughly 600,000 food items in the United States and eighty percent have added sugar (Monroe and Soechtig). The <b>American</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Associations</b> daily recommended intake of sugar for men {{is no more than}} 150 calories or nine teaspoons per day and for women no more than 100 calories or six teaspoons per day of added sugar (Sugar101). Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, says of added sugar, “…since 1985 our consumption of all added sugars-cane, beet, HFCS, glucose, honey, maple syrup, whatever-has climbed from 128 pounds to 158 pounds per person” (Pollan, pg. 104). Added sugars are hard to recognize due to not being clearly labeled. Some added sugars labeled are brown sugar, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates as well as sugar molecules: dextrose, glucose, lactose, maltose and sucrose. Common foods with added sugar are a carbonated soft drinks (12 oz. can =132.5 calories) non-fat =77.5 calories), fruit punch drink (12 oz. can =62.1 calories), vanilla ice cream (1/2 cup = 48 calories), cake doughnut (1=74.2 calories [...] )and so forth (Sugar101).|$|R

The database contains enough nonshockable rhythm samples to meet the AHA requirements for the assessment of the specificity of AED rhythm analysis algorithms. We are currently working to complete the database with enough shockable rhythm samples to assess the sensitivity of AED rhythm analysis algorithms. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background Infectious {{endocarditis}} is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening disease. Recommendations for prophylaxis {{have been}} published for more than 50 years. Traditionally, antibiotic prophylaxis has been given before dental {{and a number of}} other interventional procedures to many patient groups with cardiac conditions associated with increased risk of infectious endocarditis. Several changes in guidelines {{have been published}} in the last decade. The purpose of this study was to take a closer look at the changes in guidelines and to discuss the prophylaxis recommendations available today. Method In this study, relevant international papers from 1997 to present date were detected via Medline/ PubMed and Internet sources. Papers relevant to the discussion of prevention of endocarditis were used. Results All guidelines strongly advised good oral hygiene and regular dental care for the prevention of infectious endocarditis. Most of the guidelines also advised the use of prophylactic antibiotics, but only to patient groups with cardiac conditions associated with highest risk of infectious endocarditis and/or the highest risk of adverse outcome from the disease. Currently, the Norwegian and <b>American</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Associations</b> advise antibiotic prophylaxis during high-risk dental procedures and invasive procedures in the respiratory tract; the European Society of Cardiology recommends prophylaxis only during dental procedures; and in the latest update from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence no antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for any of the groups. There was no consensus for prophylactic guidelines related to body art procedures. Antithrombotic treatment was not included in any of the guidelines. Conclusion The trend during the last decade has been to reduce the use of antibiotic prophylaxis by recommending fewer doses, including fewer patient groups and procedures. The main reason for this seems to be lack of evidence for the effect of prophylaxis and the potential adverse effects in patients with severe allergy to antibiotics, in addition to the potential for developing resistant strains...|$|R

25|$|In the past, {{bacteremia}} {{caused by}} dental procedures (in most cases due to streptococci viridans, which reside in oral cavity), {{such as a}} cleaning or extraction of a tooth {{was thought to be}} more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new <b>American</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Association</b> guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current <b>American</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Association</b> guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians and patients.|$|E
25|$|Many health {{authorities}} {{such as the}} American Dietetic Association, the British Dietetic Association, <b>American</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Association,</b> the World Heart Federation, the British National Health Service, among others, advise that saturated fat is {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease.

30|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Heart</b> Association/American Stroke <b>Association</b> (AHA/ASA) (Kernan et al., 2014) {{considers}} revascularization with stent to be {{a therapeutic}} alternative to surgery to prevent stroke, in select patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, although in many centers surgery {{is still considered}} as the gold standard. While this recommendation is supported by multiple large randomized clinical trials, including CREST (Bonati et al., 2015; Brott et al., 2016), we currently lack long-term outcome data for CAS procedures. Further, critics of CAS cite that this approach fails to remove the plaque, which can result in restenosis and potentially new stroke events.
