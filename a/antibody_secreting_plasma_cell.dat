50|$|Interleukins are {{produced}} by lymphocytes, among other cell types, and are released in response to antigenic and non-antigenic stimuli. The gene IL2RG codes for the common gamma chain protein, which is a common subunit of the individual receptors for Interleukin 2, Interleukin 4, Interleukin 7, Interleukin 9, Interleukin 15 and Interleukin 21. Signalling from these receptors normally promotes growth and differentiation of T-cells, B cells, natural killer cells, glial cells, and cells of the monocyte lineage, depending on the cell type and receptor activated. The most important receptors for X-SCID are those for Interleukin 2, Interleukin 4, Interleukin 7, and Interleukin 15. Specifically, Interleukin 2 and Interleukin 7 are responsible for T-cell proliferation and survival. Likewise, the action of Interleukin 4 and Interleukin 15 will lead to proliferation and differentiation of B-cells into <b>antibody</b> <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> Lastly, Interleukin 15 helps generate developed and matured natural killer cells.|$|R

Here, we show that tonic BCR signal strength influences PC commitment in vivo. Using immunoglobulin light chain transgenic mice expressing suboptimal surface BCR levels and LMP 2 A knock-in animals with defined BCR-like signal strengths, we show that weak, antigen-independent constitutive BCR signaling facilitates spontaneous PC differentiation in vivo and in vitro in response to TLR agonists or CD 40 /IL 4. Conversely, increasing tonic signaling completely prevents this process which is rescued by lowering surface BCR expression or through the inhibition of Syk phosphorylation. These findings provide new insights into the role of basal BCR signaling in PC differentiation and point to the need to resolve a strong BCR signal in order to guarantee terminal differentiation...|$|R
5000|$|Immune {{response}} is the immunological response originating from immune system activation by antigens, including immunity to pathogenic microorganisms and its products, {{as well as}} autoimmunity to self-antigens allergies, and graft ejections. In this process main cells involved are the T cells, B cells of lymphocytes, and macrophagea. These cells produce lymphokines that influence the other host cells activities. B cells mature to produce immunoglobulins or antibodies, that react with antigens. At the same time, macrophages are processing the antigens into immunogenic units which stimulate B lymphocites to differentiation into <b>antibody</b> <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> stimulating the T cells to realise lymphokines.

The multifaceted phenotype of the B‐lymphocyte has a remarkably effective role in peptide derived pathogen clearance and the prevention of re‐infection. This mechanism of host tolerant defense {{can be attributed to}} the actions of particular cellular subsets that arise from Blymphocytes: memory <b>cells</b> and high‐affinity <b>antibody</b> <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> Notably B cell propagation does not commence without the help of follicular helper T cells (TFH), a specialized subset of CD 4 + cells. TFH cells are involved in the maturation and differentiation of Blymphocytes after antigen stimulation with a thymus‐dependent peptide. With this specific stimulus the formation of germinal centers (GCs) within B‐cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs is induced and it is within these centers that TFH cells are able to interact with B cells to facilitate immunoglobulin affinity maturation, somatic hypermutation, and isotype class switching. Importantly, these respective processes play a fundamental role in manufacturing high‐affinity antibodies for effective pathogen clearance. Conversely, by means not well understood, the occurrence of spontaneous GC formation and the mass production of high affinity autoreactive antibodies have been shown to occur simultaneously with the development of autoimmune diseases. By the same token this incident is of particular interest and could play a role in the destruction of pancreatic insulin secreting β cells consequently driving the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. Our objective is to identify a possible correlation between the evolution of type I diabetes and the proliferatory behavior of B‐lymphocytes and TFH cells within developing GCs of non‐obese diabetic (NOD) mouse models...|$|R
40|$|B {{lymphocytes}} {{constitute a}} key branch of adaptive immunity by providing specificity {{to recognize a}} vast variety of antigens by B cell antigen receptors (BCR) and <b>secreted</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Antigen recognition activates the cells and can produce <b>antibody</b> <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> via germinal center reaction {{that leads to the}} maturation of antigen recognition affinity and switching of antibody effector class. The specificity of antigen recognition is achieved through a multistep developmental pathway that is organized by interplay of transcription factors and signals through BCR. Lymphoid malignancies arise from different stages of development in abnormal function of transcriptional regulation. To understand the B cell development and the function of B cells, a thorough understanding of the regulation of gene expression is important. The transcription factors of the Ikaros family and Bcl 6 are frequently associated with lymphoma generation. The aim {{of this study was to}} reveal the targets of Ikaros, Helios and Bcl 6 mediated gene regulation and to find out the function of Ikaros and Helios in B cells. This study uses gene targeted DT 40 B cell lines and establishes a role for Ikaros family factors Ikaros and Helios in the regulation of BCR signaling that is important at developmental checkpoints, for cell survival and in activation. Ikaros and Helios had opposing roles in the regulation of BCR signals. Ikaros was found to directly repress the SHIP gene that encodes a signaling lipid-metabolizing enzyme, whereas Helios had activating effect on SHIP expression. The findings demonstrate a balancing function for these two Ikaros family transcription factors in the regulation of BCR signaling as well as in the regulation of gene expression. Bcl 6 was found to repress <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> gene expression program while maintaining gene expression profile of B cells.

Here, the high-resolution SWHEL B cell transgenic model is combined {{with a number of}} gene-knockout and antibody-interference perturbations in order to investigate the role of antigen affinity versus T-cell help in the regulation of positive selection and differentiation in the GC response. SWHEL B cells were adoptively transferred into CD 45 -congenic recipients and challenged with a low-affinity antigen (HEL 3 X conjugated to sheep red blood cells). Affinity maturation was observed and measured by flow cytometry, and PC differentiation tracked using a Blimp 1 -GFP reporter mouse. The impact of blocking access to antigen or T-cell help was investigated using depleting or blocking antibodies. As expected, blocking access to antigen during the GC response impaired affinity maturation and almost completely abolished the production of PCs. In stark contrast, and unexpectedly, depleting CD 4 + T cells accelerated affinity maturation and had no impact on the production of high-affinity PCs, but rather caused PCs to become trapped in the GC light zone. Using a separate murine system, the surprising observation was made that low-affinity GC B cells present more peptide:MHC-II on their surface compared to high-affinity GC B cells. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model whereby direct competition for antigen-dependent signals, not limiting T-cell help, drives positive selection and differentiation of high-affinity GC B cells into PCs. Additionally, the chemokine receptor CCR 6 was found to identify the subpopulation of GC B cells fated to differentiate into MBCs. This CCR 6 -expressing GC B-cell population was characterised in detail in two murine systems, and a corresponding population of CCR 6 -expressing MBC precursors was also noted in human tonsils, resolving the longstanding question of how to identify MBC precursors in the GC. Finally, a microarray was performed on human tonsil GCs in order to identify the genes that are most differentially expressed at the earliest stages of commitment to an MBC fate...|$|R

The binding of an antigen to receptors on B cells activates signalling cascades that induce B cell proliferation, differentiation into memory and <b>antibody</b> <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> that facilitate elimination of the antigen. PI 3 K and Vav are activated downstream of B cell receptor (BCR) and the CD 19 co-receptor, p 110 δ isoform of catalytic subunit of PI 3 Kinase was chosen {{as a candidate for}} immunological assessment as its expression pattern is limited to leukocytes unlike ubiquitously expressed α, β and γ isoforms. We determined the structure of p 110 δ gene and its deletion was achieved by Cre /LoxP recombination system. We have shown that p 110 δ function is required for BCR-mediated calcium flux, activation of PLCγ 2 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). p 110 δ -/- cells fail to activate protein kinase B (PKB) or upregulate Bcl-x L, they proliferate poorly in response to BCR or CD 40 signals in vitro, and are prone to apoptosis. p 110 δ -/- mice have reduced numbers of Bl and marginal zone B cells, reduced levels of serum immunoglobulins, respond poorly to immunisation with Type II thymus-independent antigen (TI- 2) and thymus-dependent (TD) antigen. The number of germinal centres is reduced. B 2 cell numbers are reduced in 3 -weeks old mice, but their maturation is normal (p 85 α -/- mice have reduced number of mature B cells). We also have demonstrated that Vav phosphorylation is not affected in p 110 δ deficient B cells. Vav proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho family of GTPases. Using Vavl/ 2 deficient mice we confirmed that Vav proteins {{participate in}} the calcium pathway and we placed Vav upstream of Btk and PLCγ. It remains controversial as to whether Vavl/ 2 regulate lipid kinase activity of PI 3 K, as PKB activation is not diminished. Our results suggest that p 110 δ is required for the function of the BCR signalosome and PKB pathway, p 110 δ plays a critical role in B cell homeostasis and function and may be used as a target in regulation of autoimmune diseases and malignancies associated with unrestrained signalling of PI 3 K associated molecules.

However, little is currently known about the regulation of PRDM 1. The first study presented demonstrates that in lymphoma cells stimulation through the B cell receptor rapidly induces endogenous PRDM 1 {{at the level of}} transcription. This study provides evidence that the PRDM 1 promoter is preloaded and poised for activation in the B cell lines. The transcription factor PU. 1 is shown to be required for B cell receptor induced expression of PRDM 1 in lymphoma cells and in PU. 1 positive myeloma cells. Furthermore, activation is associated with loss of the co-repressor TLE 4 from the PU. 1 complex. xiv The second study establishes the requirement for PRDM 1 in Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) response to Bortezomib. MCL, an aggressive form of B cell lymphoma, has poor disease- free survival rate. The proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib, is approved for treatment of relapsed and refractory MCL. However, the precise mechanism of action of Bortezomib is not well understood. Bortezomib rapidly induces transcription of PRDM 1 along with apoptosis in MCL cell lines and primary MCL tumor samples. Knockdown of PRDM 1 inhibits Bortezomib-induced apoptosis, while ectopic expression of PRDM 1 alone leads to apoptosis in MCL. MKI 67 and PCNA, which are required for proliferation and survival, were identified as novel direct targets of PRDM 1 in MCL. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and knockdown studies reveal specific repression of MKI 67 and PCNA is mediated by PRDM 1 in response to Bortezomib. Furthermore promoter studies demonstrate that PRDM 1 functions through a specific site in the proximal promoter region of PCNA and through a distal upstream repression domain on the MKI 67 promoter. Together these findings establish PRDM 1 as a key mediator of Bortezomib activity in MCL through suppression of proliferation and survival genes. The third study presented demonstrates use of Tandem affinity purification technique followed by mass spectrometry to identify PRDM 1 and Reptin 52 protein interactions. The observations in this study provide preliminary evidence of novel mechanism of regulation of PRDM 1 protein function...|$|R

40|$|Antibodies passively {{administered}} {{together with}} their specific antigen can enhance or suppress the specific antibody response. This phenomenon is known as antibody feedback regulation. Whether this modulation causes up- or downregulation of the antibody response depends both on the antibody isotype and the antigen used. IgG antibodies passively administered together with particulate antigens, e. g. erythrocytes, can completely prevent the induction of an antibody response to the antigen. The suppressive capacity of IgG has been routinely used in the clinic since the 1960 ’s in RhD-prophylaxis to prevent hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Although studied for decades, the underlying mechanism of IgG-suppression has remained elusive. The main focus of this thesis has been to elucidate the mechanism behind IgG-suppression of antibody responses in vivo in mouse models using intravenous immunization with specific IgG together with native or haptenated sheep red blood cells, SRBC. We show that IgG-suppression of IgM and long-term serum IgG-responses operates independently of activating FcγRI, III, IV, or the inhibitory FcγRIIB, thus confirming and extending previous findings. Moreover, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that C 1 q, C 3 and CR 1 / 2 are dispensable for IgG-suppression of antibody responses. These findings strongly argue against the involvement of Fc-dependent mechanisms as the explanation for IgG-suppression. Interestingly, GC formation occurs in IgG-suppressed mice although the antibody response to surface SRBC epitopes are completely suppressed. The data suggests that these GCs develop in response to intracellular SRBC epitopes as well as to the passively administered suppressive IgG. Moreover, we demonstrate that passively administered IgG suppresses several parameters of an antibody/B cell response including antigen specific GC and non-GC B cells, extra-follicular <b>antibody</b> <b>secreting</b> <b>cells,</b> long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and induction of immunological memory. Before the onset of the present study, two mechanisms appeared compatible with the majority of experimental findings: IgG-mediated antigen clearance and epitope masking.

This provides compelling evidence that a very important mechanism underlying IgG-suppression is epitope masking...|$|R

Memory B cells are marked by longevity, expression of antibodies with high affinity, and ability to generate robust antibody responses upon reencountering pathogens. However, requirements for the activation of mB cells and the induction of humoral memory responses are not well understood. This thesis examines the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mB activation using an immunized mouse model. TLRs are a family of receptors that recognize common molecular patterns of microbial pathogens and stimulate innate immune responses. Our study found that mouse mB expressed TLR 9 and 4, and responded to their agonists in vitro by differentiating into high affinity IgG <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> However, TLR agonists alone were not sufficient to activate memory B cells in vivo.

The Ag- specific B cells that had not yet undergone isotype switching showed a relatively higher expression of TLR 4 than memory B cells, which was reflected in a heightened response to its agonist, but in both cases of TLR 4 and 9 yielded mostly low affinity IgM <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> When immunized together with the antigen, TLR agonists not only boosted the antigen-specific titers, but also increased affinity and isotype switching of the immunoglobulin.

50|$|Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins in the {{immunoglobulin}} superfamily {{that function}} as antibodies. The terms antibody and immunoglobulin {{are often used}} interchangeably. They {{are found in the}} blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions. In structure, they are large Y-shaped globular proteins. In mammals there are five types of antibody: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Each immunoglobulin class differs in its biological properties and has evolved to deal with different antigens. Antibodies are synthesized and <b>secreted</b> by <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> that are derived from the B cells of the immune system.|$|R
40|$|Self-reactive B cells not {{controlled}} by receptor editing or clonal deletion may become anergic. We report that fully mature human B cells negative for surface IgM and retaining only IgD are autoreactive and functionally attenuated (referred to as naive IgD+IgM− B cells [BND]). These BND cells typically make up 2. 5 % of B {{cells in the}} peripheral blood, have antibody variable region genes in germline (unmutated) configuration, and, by all current measures, are fully mature. Analysis of 95 recombinant antibodies expressed from the variable genes of single BND cells demonstrated that they are predominantly autoreactive, binding to HEp- 2 cell antigens and DNA. Upon B cell receptor cross-linkage, BND cells have a reduced capacity to mobilize intracellular calcium or phosphorylate tyrosines, demonstrating that they are anergic. However, intense stimulation causes BND cells to fully respond, suggesting that these cells could be the precursors of autoantibody <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. This is the first identification of a distinct mature human B cell subset that is naturally autoreactive and controlled by the tolerizing mechanism of functional anergy...|$|R
40|$|In atopic {{patients}} and patients with hyper-IgE syndrome (HIE) highly elevated IgE serum levels can be detected. Due to their {{very low frequency}} {{little is known about}} IgE-producing <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> (PC) in peripheral blood. We used CD 138 MACS microbeads to enrich <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> from peripheral blood of normal donors, atopic {{patients and}} one HIE patient. CD 138 + cells were mainly CD 45 +, CD 44 ++, CD 19 dim, CD 38 ++, CD 27 ++, CD 86 +, HLA-DR+/++, CD 71 dim, VLA- 4 +, VLA- 5 −, CD 28 −, CD 25 −, CD 69 −, CLA−, CD 20 −, CD 21 − and CD 22 −. They show weak expression of surface Ig but high levels of intracellular Ig and they secrete Ig in culture. Thus CD 138 + cells from peripheral blood show characteristics of early <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> IgE+ CD 138 + <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> could be detected in 19 of 24 normal donors with an average frequency of 0 · 06 % IgE+ cells among CD 138 + cells. Higher frequencies were detected in atopic patients, atopic patients with markedly elevated serum IgE levels and the hyper-IgE patient with an average of 0 · 32 %, 7 · 21 % and 6 · 54 %, respectively. Additionally, using the recently developed cellular affinity matrix technology, we were able to detect IgE <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and thereby could demonstrate that most of the IgE secreting cells express CD 138. The frequency of IgE+ CD 138 + cells among PBMC correlated highly significantly with serum IgE titres (r = 0 · 8532 ***), indicating that IgE secreting CD 138 + cells in peripheral blood are directly related to the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> pool contributing to the IgE titre...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{understanding}} of inflammatory dermatoses and autoimmune-mediated skin disorders has greatly advanced and broadened our understanding of underlying immune mechanisms that shape the complex network of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. The new treatment options for psoriasis exemplify how new insights into (auto) immune responses, especially the role and function of various immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines, may lead to new therapeutic strategies. The concept of targeting B cells in autoimmune-mediated disorders {{is closely related to}} the discovery of autoantibodies and their cellular origin. However, the appreciation of B cells in autoimmunity has significantly changed and is not limited to their role as progenitors of autoantibody <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> Recent investigations of various inflammatory skin diseases, that is, autoimmune blistering disorders, collagen vascular diseases, and atopic dermatitis, actually support the concept that B cells might be as important as T cells in the etiopathogenesis of these disorders. The striking clinical improvement seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis following B-cell depletion with the anti-CD 20 mAb rituximab has tremendously catalyzed the interest in B-cell-targeted therapies in different autoimmune diseases. Future translational and clinical investigations are mandatory to precisely define the role and the contribution of impaired B-cell function in (auto) immune-mediated skin diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of bone marrow-derived lymphocytes in mice {{is characterized by}} the sequential appearance of different surface markers. IgM is the first isotype to appear, and IgM ÷ cells subsequently acquire IgD. The acquisition of IgD appears to be antigen and T cell independem (1). The roles of these two surface isotypes in the triggering of B ceils is the subject of intensive study. When mature B cells bearing both isotypes are triggered by mitogens, IgD is lost and the cells differentiate into IgM <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> (1 - 3). Recent evidence indicates that several nonsecreting B cell tumors from humans (4, 5) and mice (6) have the capacity to secrete IgM under the influence of mitogens (5), T cells (4), or after fusion to myeloma cells (7). One of the murine tumors, BCLx, has been used in the present studies to investigate the pathway of B cell differentiation that {{is characterized by the}} acquisition of IgD. The uncultured tumor cells bear large quantities of surface IgM and trace amounts of IgD (8 - 10). Thus, both the phenotypic characteristics (8) and, in addition, the functional properties (9, 10) of BCLx cells suggest that they are analogous to immature B cells. In the present studies we hav...|$|R

In order {{to appreciate the}} implications of IgG 4 immunostaining, we analyzed gene expression and the prevalence of IgG 4 - immunostaining among subjects with orbital inflammatory diseases. Methods We organized an international consortium to collect orbital biopsies from 108 subjects including 22 with no known orbital disease, 42 with nonspecific orbital inflammatory disease (NSOI), 26 with thyroid eye disease (TED), 12 with sarcoidosis, and 6 with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Lacrimal gland and orbital adipose tissue biopsies were immunostained for IgG 4 or IgG <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> RNA transcripts were quantified by Affymetrix arrays. Results None of the healthy controls or subjects with TED had substantial IgG 4 staining. Among the 63 others, the prevalence of significant IgG 4 -immunostaining ranged from 11 to 39 % depending on the definition for significant. IgG 4 staining was detectable {{in the majority of}} tissues from subjects with GPA and less commonly in tissue from subjects with sarcoidosis or NSOI. The detection of IgG 4 + cells correlated with inflammation in the lacrimal gland based on histology. IgG 4 staining tissue expressed an increase in transcripts associated with inflammation, especially B cell-related genes. Functional annotation analysis confirmed this. Conclusion IgG 4 + <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are common in orbital tissue from patients with sarcoidosis, GPA, or NSOI. Even using the low threshold of 10 IgG 4 + cells/high powered field, IgG 4 staining correlates with increased inflammation in the lacrimal gland based on histology and gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Although {{functional}} asplenia from infarctions {{may be a}} {{major contributor}} to increased infectious mortality in sickle-cell disease (SCD), this relationship has not been fully defined. We used the transgenic Berkeley SCD mouse to define blood and splenic immunophenotypic differences in this model compared with C 57 BL/ 6 and hemizygous controls. In the serum of SCD mice, we found increased IgG 2 a and suppressed IgM, IgG 2 b, and IgA levels. Serum IL- 6 levels in SCD mice were elevated, whereas IL- 1 α, CXCL 10, and CCL 5 levels were decreased. The blood of SCD mice had higher white blood cell counts, with an increased percentage of lymphocytes and decreases in other leukocytes. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes revealed higher percentages of CD 8 + and T-regulatory cells and lower percentages of B cells. SCD mouse spleens exhibited histological disorganization, with reduction of defined lymphoid follicles and expansion of red pulp, a greater than fourfold increase in splenic mononuclear cells, marked expansion of the nucleated red blood cell fraction, and B-cell and CD 8 + T-cell lymphopenia. Within the splenic B-cell population, there was a significant decrease in B- 1 a B cells, with a corresponding decrease in IgA <b>secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in the gut. Confocal microscopy of spleens demonstrated complete disruption of the normal lymphofollicular structure in the white pulp of SCD mice without distinct B, T, and marginal zones.
