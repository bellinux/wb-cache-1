25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{experiments}} by Ernest Rutherford established that atoms {{consisted of a}} diffuse cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding a small, dense, positively charged nucleus. Given this experimental data, Rutherford naturally considered a planetary-model atom, the Rutherford model of 1911 – electrons orbiting a solar nucleus – however, said planetary-model atom has a technical difficulty. The laws of classical mechanics (i.e. the Larmor formula), predict that the electron will release electromagnetic radiation while orbiting a nucleus. Because the electron would lose energy, it would rapidly spiral inwards, collapsing into the nucleus on a timescale of around 16 picoseconds. This <b>atom</b> <b>model</b> is disastrous, because it predicts that all atoms are unstable.|$|E
2500|$|Triple bonds {{could not}} be {{accounted}} for by the cubical <b>atom</b> <b>model,</b> because {{there is no way of}} having two cubes share three parallel edges. Lewis suggested that the electron pairs in atomic bonds have a special attraction, which result in a tetrahedral structure, as in the figure below (the new location of the electrons is represented by the dotted circles in the middle of the thick edges). This allows the formation of a single bond by sharing a corner, a double bond by sharing an edge, and a triple bond by sharing a face. It also accounts for the free rotation around single bonds and for the tetrahedral geometry of methane.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that for each {{multipole}} of every atom its population is being refined independently, individual charges will rarely be integers.

40|$|Background The protein {{structure}} prediction problem {{is one of}} the most challenging problems in biological sciences. Many approaches have been proposed using database information and/or simplified protein models. The {{protein structure}} prediction problem can be cast in the form of an optimization problem. Notwithstanding its importance, the problem has very seldom been tackled by Constraint Logic Programming, a declarative programming paradigm suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Results Constraint Logic Programming techniques have been applied to the protein structure prediction problem on the face-centered cube lattice model. Molecular dynamics techniques, endowed with the notion of constraint, have been also exploited. Even using a very simplified model, Constraint Logic Programming on the face-centered cube lattice model allowed us to obtain acceptable results for a few small proteins. As a test implementation their (known) secondary structure and the presence of disulfide bridges are used as constraints. Simplified structures obtained in this way have been converted to all <b>atom</b> <b>models</b> with plausible structure. Results have been compared with a similar approach using a well-established technique as molecular dynamics. Conclusions The results obtained on small proteins show that Constraint Logic Programming techniques can be employed for studying protein simplified models, which can be converted into realistic all <b>atom</b> <b>models.</b> Th...|$|R
