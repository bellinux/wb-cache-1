5|$|The {{procedures}} used for decompression {{depend on the}} mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment and the actual dive profile. Standardized procedures have been developed that provide <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> of risk in appropriate circumstances. Different sets of procedures are used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used, and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>level,</b> but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E

5|$|König Wilhelm {{was also}} badly damaged in the collision, with severe {{flooding}} forward. König Wilhelms captain initially planned on beaching {{the ship to}} prevent it from sinking, but determined that the ship's pumps could hold the flooding to <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>level.</b> The ship made for Portsmouth, where temporary repairs could be effected to allow the ship to return to Germany. In the aftermath of the collision, the German navy held a court martial for Rear Admiral Batsch, the squadron commander, and Captains Monts and Kuehne, the commanders of the two ships, along with Lieutenant Clausa, the first officer aboard Grosser Kurfürst, to investigate the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|While {{the battle}} was taking place, the 65mm {{artillery}}, four Napoleonchik canons, reached the front {{in the middle of}} the day and were placed on the Poria–Alumot ridge. It was the first Israeli artillery to be used in the war. At 13:20, they began to fire at the Syrians, and about 40 rounds the latter began to retreat. The Israelis also fired into Samakh, where the Syrian officers, who had until then believed that the Israelis had nothing that could hit their headquarters, took shelter. One projectile hit the Syrian ammunition depot in the village, and others ignited fires in the dry fields. While the soldiers who operated the cannons (still lacking sights) were not proficient in handling them, <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> of accuracy was achieved after practice shots into the Sea of Galilee. In all, the artillery fire took the Syrian army by complete surprise, and the latter decided to regroup and retreat to Tel al-Qasr, also recalling the company at Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. A total of 500 shells were fired by the Israeli artillery. Syrian officers may have shot some of their fleeing soldiers.|$|E
