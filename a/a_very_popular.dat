5|$|The {{influence}} of this old constellation of iconographic elements {{can still be}} seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha.

5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores on the street, and {{has a number of}} listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, the combination of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>popular</b> retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis has caused significant problems with traffic congestion, safety and pollution.

5|$|Słowacki was not <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>popular</b> {{figure in}} Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, {{which can be}} seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
5|$|The late 12th-century defences at Framlingham Castle have invoked {{much debate}} by scholars. One interpretation, put forward for example by {{historian}} R. Allen Brown, {{is that they}} were relatively advanced for their time and represented a change in contemporary thinking about military defence. Framlingham has no keep, for example – this had been <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>popular</b> feature in previous Anglo-Norman castles, but this castle breaks with the tradition, relying on the curtain wall and mural towers instead. The pattern of ground-level arrowslits at Framlingham were similarly innovative for their time, enabling interlocking and flanking fire against attackers. The design of Framlingham's defences is similar in many ways to Henry II's innovative work at Dover and Orford.|$|E
5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a {{compromise}} in detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects {{is the development of}} the lathe turned (tuned) pillars and use of Soapstone (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>popular</b> idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E
