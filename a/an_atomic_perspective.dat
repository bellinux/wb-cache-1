40|$|Nanoparticles usually exhibit {{pronounced}} anisotropic properties, {{and a close}} {{insight into}} the atomic-scale deformation mechanisms is of great interest. In present study, atomic simulations are conducted to analyze the compression of bcc nanoparticles, and orientation-dependent features are addressed. It is revealed that surface morphology under indenter predominantly governs the initial elastic response. The loading curve follows the flat punch contact model in [110] compression, while it obeys the Hertzian contact model in [111] and [001] compressions. In plastic deformation regime, full dislocation gliding is dominated in [110] compression, while deformation twinning is prominent in [111] compression, and these two mechanisms coexist in [001] compression. Such deformation mechanisms are distinct from those in bulk crystals under nanoindentation and nanopillars under compression, and the major differences are also illuminated. Our results provide <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>perspective</b> on the mechanical behaviors of bcc nanoparticles and are helpful {{for the design of}} nanoparticle-based components and systems.

40|$|Organisms try to {{maintain}} homeostasis by balanced uptake of nutrients from their envi-ronment. From <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>perspective</b> this means that, for example, carbon:nitrogen:sulfur ratios are kept within given limits. Upon limitation of, for example, sulfur, its acquisition is triggered. For yeast it was shown that transporters and enzymes involved in sulfur up-take are encoded as paralogous genes that express different isoforms. Sulfur deprivation leads to up-regulation of isoforms that are poor in sulfur-containing amino acids, that is, methinone and cysteine. Accordingly, sulfur-rich isoforms are down-regulated. We developed a web-based software, doped Nutrilyzer, that extracts paralogous protein coding sequences from an annotated genome sequence and evaluates their atomic compo-sition. When fed with gene-expression data for nutrient limited and normal conditions, Nutrilyzer provides a list of genes that are significantly differently expressed and simul-taneously contain significantly different amounts of the limited nutrient in their atomic composition. Its intended use is {{in the field of}} ecological stoichiometry. Nutrilyzer is available a...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, an {{extensive}} characterisation of intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) passivation layers deposited on n- and p-type silicon is reported. Low temperature capacitance-voltage measurements are utilised to enable parameter extraction from the c-Si/a-Si interface and a-Si bulk. Electron spin resonance enables atomic {{identification of defects}} present. Results reveal the presence of electrically active defects at the c-Si/intrinsic a-Si interface (∼ 1 x 1012 cm- 2), and throughout the amorphous silicon layer bulk (∼ 8 x 1016 cm- 3), which are atomically identified as Pb 0 centres and D centres silicon dangling bond defects, respectively. The value of this work is the atomic identification of these defects in this stack, coupled with their electrical activity.

40|$|Hybridsysteme aus elektrisch leitfähigen, durchsichtigen anorganischen Materialien in Kombination mit optisch aktiven organischen Molekülen haben das Potenzial, die Funktionalität und Effizienz heutiger optoelektronischer Systeme - wie LEDs oder Solarzellen - deutlich zu übertreffen. Voraussetzung hierfür ist jedoch ein tiefgreifendes Verständnis der zugrunde liegenden elementaren elektronischen Prozesse: Transfer von Ladung und Energie oder Bildung von Quasiteilchen wie Polaronen und Exzitonen an der Grenzfläche zwischen den Materialklassen. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, diese grundlegenden Prozesse an Modellgrenzflächen, deren Komplexität schrittweise erhöht wird, zu verstehen und damit die unvollständige konventionelle, vornehmlich elektrostatische Beschreibung solcher Systeme zu erweitern. Die Methode der zeitaufgelösten Zweiphotonen-Photoemissionsspektroskopie ermöglicht hier sowohl die Untersuchung der elektronischen Struktur von Grenzflächen als auch der {{relevant}}en dynamischen Prozesse auf Femto- bis Pikosekunden-Zeitskalen. Die betrachteten Modellsysteme basieren auf Zinkoxid (ZnO), einem prototypischen transparenten leitfähigen Material, an dessen Oberfläche bei Adsorption von Wasserstoff der Übergang von einem Halbleiter zu einem Metall beobachtet wird. Die wasserstoffinduzierten Veränderungen der Oberfläche führen anfänglich zu stark lokalisierten Potentialmulden, an denen die Energie des Leitungsbandbodens unter die Fermi-Energie sinkt. Die Ladungsträgerdichte N an der Oberfläche lässt sich somit durch Wasserstoffadsorption gezielt beeinflussen. Die Dynamik angeregter Elektronen an der ZnO-Oberfläche wird zunächst durch ultraschnelle Relaxationsprozesse im ZnO Leitungsband dominiert, bedingt durch effiziente Elektron-Phonon-Streuung. Die zugrunde liegende Coulomb-Wechselwirkung kann durch Erhöhung von N abgeschirmt werden, sodass der Relaxationsprozess signifikant verlangsamt wird. Zusätzlich wird die Bildung eines oberflächennahen exzitonischen Zustands innerhalb von 200 fs beobachtet. Dieser zeigt eine Zerfallsdynamik auf einer Zeitskala von hunderten Pikosekunden und bleibt auch nach Kontakt der ZnO-Oberfläche mit Luft und bei Raumtemperatur detektierbar. Damit ist dieses Exziton möglicherweise äußerst relevant für Energietransferprozesse an Hybridgrenzflächen. Als erstes Hybridsystem zur Untersuchung von Oberflächenmodifikationen durch organische Moleküle dient Pyridin/ZnO(10 - 10). Die beobachtete deutliche Reduktion der Austrittsarbeit um 2. 9 eV kann durch das Zusammenwirken von statischem und bindungsinduziertem Dipol erklärt werden. Der zugrunde liegende Mechanismus ermöglicht potentiell die Herstellung hocheffizienter transparenter Kathoden. Im nächsten Schritt wurden Ladungstransferprozesse an der 5 -Phenyl-Pyridin/ZnO-Grenzfläche analysiert. Ähnlich dem Pyridin bindet dieses MolekÜl wahrscheinlich mit dem endständigen Stickstoff-Atom ans ZnO. Elektronen können hier von einem besetzten Grenzflächenzustand in einen unbesetzten Molekülzustand angeregt werden, wo offenbar die Bildung eines Polarons mit dem ultraschnellen (90 fs) Rücktransfer ins ZnO-Substrat konkurriert. Diese Arbeit zeigt deutlich die Zusammenhänge zwischen mikroskopischen Materialeigenschaften und den komplexen dynamischen Prozessen an Grenzflächen. Das gewonnene detaillierte Verständnis elementarer Prozesse in prototypischen Hybridsystemen klärt fundamentale Fragen der Dynamik angeregter Zustände und kann als Grundlage für weitere Studien dienen. Hybrid systems {{consisting of}} electrically conducting, transparent inorganic materials combined with optically active molecules may potentially surpass current optoelectronic systems, e. g., LEDs or photovoltaic cells, in functionality and efficiency. However, this requires a profound {{understanding of the}} elementary electronic processes, such as charge or energy transfer, at the interface between the two material classes. The aim of this work is to explore and understand these processes at successively more complex model hybrid interfaces {{in order to improve}} the incomplete conventional description of those systems, which mainly focuses on electrostatics. For this, the method of time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy allows the precise analysis of interfacial electronic structures and the relevant electron and quasiparticle dynamics on femto- to picosecond timescales. In this work, zinc oxide (ZnO) serves as inorganic substrate material. It is a prototypical transparent conductive oxide, where a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed at the surface after hydrogen adsorption. This process is comprehensively explained from <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>perspective.</b> The hydrogen-induced changes to the surface initially lead to strongly localized potential wells at which the energy of the conduction band bottom is lowered below the Fermi level. By selective dosing of hydrogen, the charge carrier density N and, thus, the metallic character of the surface can be tuned precisely. The dynamics of photoexcited electrons at the ZnO surface is, initially, dominated by the ultrafast relaxation in the ZnO conduction band, caused by strong electron [...] phonon coupling. The underlying Coulomb interaction can be screened by the increase of N, which leads to a significant slowing down of the dynamics. In addition, the formation of an excitonic state is observed within the first 200 fs after excitation. The exciton is localized at the hydrogen-induced potential wells and exhibits an initial decay time of hundreds of picoseconds. Further, it remains detectable even after exposing the sample surface to air and at room temperature. Hence, this exciton state may be highly relevant for energy transfer processes at hybrid interfaces. A first hybrid system to analyze ZnO surface modifications by organic molecules is the pyridine/ZnO(10 - 10) interface. The drastic reduction of the work function by 2. 9 eV {{can be explained by the}} collaborative effect of the static molecular and bond-induced dipoles. The underlying mechanism potentially enables the creation of highly efficient transparent cathodes. As a next step, charge transfer processes at the 5 -phenyl-pyridine/ZnO interface were examined. Similar to pyridine, the molecules supposedly bind to the ZnO substrate via their nitrogen end atom. Here, electrons can be excited from an occupied interfacial state to an unoccupied molecular state, where presumably polaron formation competes with the ultrafast back-transfer (90 fs) to the ZnO substrate. This work provides a novel detailed view on model ZnO-based interfaces, as it clearly illustrates the correlations between the microscopic properties and the complex dynamical processes. The obtained detailed understanding of prototypical hybrid systems answers a number of fundamental questions regarding the dynamics of excited states and it may serve as a basis for further studies.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in high-intensity electron and X-ray pulsed sources now {{make it possible}} to directly observe atomic motions as they occur in barrier-crossing processes. These rare events require the structural dynamics to be triggered by femtosecond excitation pulses that prepare the system above the barrier or access new potential energy surfaces that drive the structural changes. In general, the sampling process modifies the system such that the structural probes should ideally have sufficient intensity to fully resolve structures near the single-shot limit for a given time point. New developments in both source intensity and temporal characterization of the pulsed sampling mode have made it possible to make so-called 'molecular movies', i. e. measure relative atomic motions faster than collisions can blur information on correlations. Strongly driven phase transitions from thermally propagated melting to optically modified potential energy surfaces leading to ballistic phase transitions and bond stiffening are given as examples of the new insights that can be gained from <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> level <b>perspective</b> of structural dynamics.

40|$|One of {{the great}} dream {{experiments}} in Science is to directly observe atomic motions as they occur. Femtosecond electron diffraction provided the first 'light' of sufficient intensity {{to achieve this goal}} by attaining atomic resolution to structural changes on the relevant timescales. This review covers the technical progress that made this new level of acuity possible and gives a survey of the new insights gained from <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> level <b>perspective</b> of structural dynamics. Atomic level views of the simplest possible structural transition, melting, are discussed for a number of systems in which both thermal and purely electronically driven atomic displacements can be correlated with the degree of directional bonding. Optical manipulation of charge distributions and effects on interatomic forces/bonding can be directly observed through the ensuing atomic motions. New phenomena involving strongly correlated electron–lattice systems are also discussed in which optically induced changes in the potential energy landscape lead to ballistic structural changes. Concepts such as the structural order parameters are now directly observable at the atomic level of inspection to give a remarkable view of the extraordinary degree of cooperativity involved in strongly correlated electron–lattice systems. These recent examples, in combination with time-resolved real space imaging now possible with electron probes, are truly defining an emerging field that holds great promise to make a significant impact in how we understand structural dynamics.

40|$|The {{properties}} of phase transitions {{and the types}} of order present in the low-temperature states of matter are fundamentally dependent on the dimensionality of physical systems. Generally, highly ordered states are more robust in higher dimensions, while thermal and quantum fluctuations, which favour disordered states, play a more important role in lower dimensions. The case of a two-dimensional (2 d) Bose fluid is particularly fascinating because of its "marginal" behaviour. In an infinite uniform 2 d fluid thermal fluctuations at any non-zero temperature are strong enough to destroy the fully ordered state associated with Bose [...] Einstein condensation, but are not strong enough to suppress superfluidity in an interacting system at low, but non-zero temperatures. Further, the presence of residual "quasi-long-range" order at low temperatures leads to an interesting interplay between superfluidity and condensation in all experimentally relevant finite-size systems. In these notes we give an introduction to the physics of 2 d Bose fluids from <b>an</b> <b>atomic</b> physics <b>perspective.</b> Our goal is to summarize the recent progress in theoretical understanding and experimental investigation of ultra-cold atomic gases confined to 2 d geometry, and we also hope to provide a useful introduction to these systems for researchers working on related topics in other fields of physics.
