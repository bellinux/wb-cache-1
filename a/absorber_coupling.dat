40|$|Abstract. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are thin-film, superconducting resonators, {{which are}} {{attractive}} for making large detector arrays {{due to their}} natural frequency domain multiplexing at GHz frequencies. For X-ray to IR wavelengths, MKIDs can provide high-resolution energy and timing information for each incoming photon. By fabricating strip detectors consisting of a rectangular <b>absorber</b> <b>coupled</b> to MKIDs at each end, high quantum efficiency and spatial resolution can be obtained. A similar geometry is being pursued for phonon sensing in a WIMP dark matter detector. Various materials have been tested including tantalum, tin, and aluminum for the absorbing strip, and aluminum, titanium, and aluminum manganese for the MKID. Initial Ta/Al X-ray devices have shown energy resolutions as good as 62 eV at 6 keV. A Ta/Al UV strip detector with an energy resolution of 0. 8 eV at 4. 9 eV has been demonstrated, but we find the coupling of the MKIDs to the absorbers is unreliable for these thinner devices. We report on progress probing the thicknesses at which the absorber/MKID coupling begins to degrade by using a resonator to inject quasiparticles directly into the absorber. In order to eliminate the absorber/MKID interface, a modified design for implanted AlMn/Al UV strip detectors was developed, and results showing good transmission of quasiparticles from the absorber to MKID in these devices are presented...|$|R
40|$|A feed-horn-coupled {{monolithic}} {{array of}} micromesh bolometers is undergoing development {{for use in}} a photometric camera.

The bolometers are improved versions of previously developed bolometers comprising metalized Si 3 N 4 micromesh radiation <b>absorbers</b> <b>coupled</b> with neutron- transmutation-doped Ge thermistors. Incident radiation heats the absorbers above a base temperature, changing the electrical resistance of each thermistor. In the present array of improved bolometers (see figure), the thermistors are attached to the micromesh absorbers by indium bump bonds and are addressed by use of lithographed, vapor-deposited electrical leads. This architecture reduces the heat capacity and minimizes the thermal conductivity to 1 / 20 and 1 / 300, respectively, of earlier versions of these detectors, with consequent improvement in sensitivity and speed of response. The micromesh bolometers, intended to operate under an optical background set by thermal emission from an ambient-temperature space-borne telescope, are designed such that the random arrival of photons ("photon noise") dominates the noise sources arising from the detector and readout electronics. The micromesh is designed to be a highly thermally and optically efficient absorber with a limiting response time of about 100 s. The absorber and thermistor heat capacity are minimized in order to give rapid speed of response. Due to the minimization of the absorber volume, the dominant source of heat capacity arises from the thermistor...|$|R
40|$|In January 2012, the 10 m South Pole Telescope (SPT) was {{equipped}} with a polarization-sensitive camera, SPTpol, {{in order to measure}} the polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Measurements of the polarization of the CMB at small angular scales (~several arcminutes) can detect the gravitational lensing of the CMB by large scale structure and constrain the sum of the neutrino masses. At large angular scales (~few degrees) CMB measurements can constrain the energy scale of Inflation. SPTpol is a two-color mm-wave camera that consists of 180 polarimeters at 90 GHz and 588 polarimeters at 150 GHz, with each polarimeter consisting of a dual transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers. The full complement of 150 GHz detectors consists of 7 arrays of 84 ortho-mode transducers (OMTs) that are stripline coupled to two TES detectors per OMT, developed by the TRUCE collaboration and fabricated at NIST.

Specifically, the hard X-ray polarimetry is more rewarding because the sources {{are expected to be}} intrinsically highly polarized at higher energies. With the successful implementation of Hard X-ray optics in NuSTAR, it is now feasible to conceive Compton polarimeters as focal plane detectors. Such a configuration is likely to provide sensitive polarization measurements in hard X-rays with a broad energy band. We are developing a focal plane hard X-ray Compton polarimeter consisting of a plastic scintillator as active scatterer surrounded by a cylindrical array of CsI(Tl) scintillators. The scatterer is 5 mm diameter and 100 mm long plastic scintillator (BC 404) viewed by normal PMT. The photons scattered by the plastic scatterer are collected by a cylindrical array of 16 CsI(Tl) scintillators (5 mm x 5 mm x 150 mm) which are read by Si Photomultiplier (SiPM). Use of the new generation SiPMs ensures the compactness of the instrument which is essential for the design of focal plane detectors.

One of the prime importance of using TLD as an effective <b>absorber</b> <b>coupled</b> with structure is to impart the effect of fatigue stresses accompanied with the repeated excitation loads. The serviceability of the high rise buildings and the steel towers is another important application of using TLD to suppress the building acceleration and realize the comfort and healthy conditions. The full scale measurements of the structure dynamic response exhibits an effective method for the validation of the structure design procedure and emphasize the accuracy of the numerical models suggested predicting the structure dynamic response. The current model behaves as a NSE model accurately predict the sloshing fluid motion inside TLD and handles the moving free surface by using the (VOF) method. The current model use the continuum surface force model CSF to model the discontinuity accompanied with wave breaking inside TLD. The numerical model used in this paper predicts the interaction between the structure dynamic response and highlights the damping effect of TLD groups allocated at different floors of tall buildings. The current model suggests a new criterion to detect the wave breaking and focus attention on the effect of wave breaking on the impact force in due to the sloshing fluid motion inside TLD {{for a wide range of}} excitation frequencies.

This thesis involves work on both fronts, combining observational work {{using data from}} the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Keck Observatory with novel superconducting detector development to further technology for future observatories. The subject of {{the first part of this}} thesis is the Serendipitous Extragalactic X-ray Source Identification (SEXSI) program, a survey using Chandra data selected to probe the dominant contributors to the 2 - 10 keV cosmic X-ray background. SEXSI covers more than 2 square degrees of sky and employs optical photometric and spectroscopic followup of sources discovered in archival Chandra fields. The resulting sample consists of 1034 hard X-ray-selected sources with R-band optical-followup imaging, and optical spectroscopy for 477 of the sources, filling the gap between wide-area, shallow surveys and the deep, pencil-beam surveys. The vast majority of the 2 - 10 keV-selected sample are AGN with redshifts between 0. 1 and 3. We discuss results from our survey, including the spectroscopic properties of hard X-ray sources and the relationship between X-ray and optical properties of our sources. In addition, we present infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope that cover a subset of the Chandra fields, which allows us to explore the relative strengths of Chandra and Spitzer as black-hole finders. The second part of this thesis focuses on microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), a superconducting detector technology that has breakthrough potential for providing megapixel imagers with several eV energy resolution for use in future X-ray missions. These detectors utilize simple, thin-film lithographed microwave resonators as photon detectors in a multiplexed readout approach. X-ray absorption in a superconductor creates quasiparticle excitations, with number proportional to the X-ray energy. The surface impedance of a superconductor changes with the quasiparticle density, and if operated at T << T_c, extremely small changes in the surface impedance can be measured using the thin-film resonant circuit and microwave readout techniques. This provides a sensitive detector with excellent energy resolution. MKIDs offer the advantage over many other cryogenic detector technologies that they can be easily multiplexed by coupling many resonators to a single microwave transmission line. In addition, the readout electronics can be operated at room temperature, a significant advantage for space applications. The practical application of MKIDs for photon detection requires a method of efficiently coupling the photon energy to the MKID. To this end we have been studying MKIDs in a strip detector architecture. The second part of this thesis presents our results using strip detectors with tantalum <b>absorbers</b> <b>coupled</b> to aluminum MKIDs...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, we have proposed, designed, and {{fabricated}} an ultra-wideband perfect metamaterial absorber with polarized-insensitivity and wide-incident absorption. The angular absorption spectrum, surface current, {{and near}} electric-field distributions were explored {{to validate the}} excellent characteristics of the proposed perfect metamaterial <b>absorber</b> with strong <b>coupling</b> effects. The fabricated metamaterial absorber device was fabricated, measured, and analyzed. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} ultra-broadband absorption from 4.48 to 25.46 [*]GHz could be achieved with absorptivity larger than 80 % with normal incidences for x-polarization and y-polarization. For the oblique incidences with the incident angle of 45 °, the perfect metamaterial absorber exhibited the relative bandwidth of 136 % with absorptivity larger than 60 % for different polarized incidences. This perfect metamaterial absorber device with the innovation is promising for many practical applications such as radar cross scatter reduction and electromagnetic protection in different flight platform.|$|R

We consider a plant model possessing curvature and inertia nonlinearities and introduce a second-order <b>absorber</b> that is <b>coupled</b> with the plant through user-defined cubic nonlinearities. When the plant is excited at primary resonance and the absorber frequency is approximately equal to the plant natural frequency, we show {{the existence of a}} saturation phenomenon. As the forcing amplitude is increased beyond a certain threshold, the response amplitude of the directly excited mode (plant) remains constant, while the response amplitude of the indirectly excited mode (absorber) increases. We obtain an approximate solution to the governing equations using the method of multiple scales and show that the system possesses two possible saturation values. Using numerical techniques, we perform stability analyses and demonstrate that the system exhibits complicated dynamics, such as Hopf bifurcations, intermittency, and chaotic responses...|$|R
40|$|The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is {{a channel}} of superconducting solenoid magnets. The magnets in MICE are around the RF cavities, {{absorbers}} (liquid or solid) {{and the primary}} particle detectors [1], [2]. The MICE superconducting solenoid system consists of eighteen coils that are grouped in three types of magnet assemblies. The cooling channel consists of two complete cell of an SFOFO cooling channel. Each cell consists of a focusing coil pair around an <b>absorber</b> and a <b>coupling</b> coil around a RF cavity that re-accelerates the muons to their original momentum. At {{the ends of the}} experiment are uniform field solenoids for the particle detectors and a set of matching coils used to match the muon beam to the cooling cells. Three absorbers are used instead of two in order to shield the detectors from dark currents generated by the RF cavities at high operating acceleration gradients...|$|R
