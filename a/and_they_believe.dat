5|$|Mahavira {{has been}} mistakenly called {{the founder of}} Jainism.

The first 22 Tirthankaras are placed in mythical times. For example, the 22nd Tirthankara Arishtanemi is believed in the Jain tradition to have been born 84,000 years before the 23rd Tirthankara named Parshvanatha. Mahavira is sometimes placed within Parshvanatha lineage, but this is contradicted by all Jain texts, which state that Mahavira renounced the world alone.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{opposing}} {{sides of the}} sex education argument amongst parents: the sexual liberals and the sexual conservatives.

Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals {{to be included in the}} conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through abstinence-only programs.|$|E
25|$|For Eastern Orthodox Christians, fasting is an {{important}} spiritual discipline, found in both the Old Testament and the New, and {{is tied to the}} principle in Orthodox theology of the synergy between the body (Greek: soma) and the soul (pneuma). That is to say, Orthodox Christians do not see a dichotomy between the body and the soul but rather consider them as a united whole, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that what happens to one affects the other (this is known as the psychosomatic union between the body and the soul). Saint Gregory Palamas argued that man's body is not an enemy but a partner and collaborator with the soul. Christ, by taking a human body at the Incarnation, has made the flesh an inexhaustible source of sanctification. This same concept is also found in the much earlier homilies of Saint Macarius the Great.|$|E

25|$|After they officially {{filed the}} case in Jalisco, the family members {{sent a letter to}} former Mexican President Felipe Calderón (2006–2012). Calderón responded to their request and {{assigned}} the investigation to the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). However, the family stated that the PGR did not follow-up with them for over a month after officially being assigned to the case. The fishermen group had attended a meeting on March 17 in Guadalajara, where they reportedly received death threats from a man named Antonio Vélez. The family members believe that the disappearance of their three members stemmed from conflicts they had with Gasparotto and ejido members from Portezuelos, La Barca, Jalisco in those two meetings. According to their version of the story, former Governor of Jalisco Francisco Javier Ramírez Acuña hosted parties at Hotelito Desconocido <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> he might be responsible for the mass disappearance. They also said Calderón visited too. The mother of one of the missing members stated that Efraín Aréchiga, the lawyer who was in company of the three men in Guadalajara, did not return to La Cruz de Loreto for six months after they went missing. She believes that his six month hiatus was suspicious and that he might be involved in the mass disappearance as well.|$|E

The evaluation, completed by two psychologists from the Western State Hospital on October 19, concluded Clemmons was dangerous and presented {{an increased risk of}} future criminal acts. Pierce County Judge John McCarthy set bail for Clemmons' assault charges at $40,000, considerably below the $100,000 prosecutors sought based on Clemmons' history of violence. Pierce County Judge Thomas Felnagle set bail for the child-rape charges at $150,000, lower than the $200,000 sought by prosecutors, but higher than usual for the charges.|$|E
500|$|On the ringworld, the Chief rallies human {{survivors}} and leads a boarding party to rescue Keyes from the Covenant's clutches. Keyes {{reveals that the}} Covenant call the ring [...] "Halo", <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> it {{is some sort of}} weapon. The Chief is tasked with finding Halo's control room before the Covenant does. Once Cortana is inserted into the control room, she becomes alarmed and stays behind while she sends the Master Chief to find Keyes. While searching for the captain, the Master Chief encounters the Flood, a parasitic organism that infects sentient life. The release prompts Halo's caretaker, the AI 343 Guilty Spark, to enlist the Chief's help in activating Halo's defenses. The Chief's activation of the ring from the Control Room is stopped by Cortana, who reveals that Halo's defenses do not kill Flood, but rather their food in an effort to starve them—meaning that activating the ring would wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy. To stop the Flood from spreading and Spark from activating the ring, Cortana devises a plan to detonate the crashed Autumns engines and destroy Halo. Fighting through Flood, Covenant, and Guilty Spark's robotic Sentinels, the Chief manually destabilizes the Autumns reactors and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a Longsword fighter.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{separate}} interview, Jackson stated that {{while on the}} surface Lucky may not want the child to be his, deep down he thinks {{a part of the}} character does. Elizabeth hopes Lucky is the father, thinking {{it is the only way}} she can salvage their relationship, and has a difficult time coming to terms with Lucky not wanting her anymore. After Lucky finds her suffering from hypothermia in the church where they said their vows as teenagers, and later has to talk her down off the roof of the hospital, she is sent to Shadybrook sanitarium. This prompts Lucky to be gentler about his anger, and to stop drinking before suffering a serious relapse. Jackson explained: [...] "The crisis that's going on with Elizabeth, the fact that Cam and Jake don't have a mother right now, I think that sort of wakes Lucky up to say, 'I need to get my stuff together because I need to be present for those kids.'" [...] Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> Nikolas to be the father due to Helena tampering with the DNA test. Aiden is kidnapped by Franco, forcing Lucky to work together with Nikolas, which starts to repair their relationship. Still feeling lost, Lucky accepts an undercover assignment to pose as an Irish hitman named Ronan O'Reilly, coincidentally his doppelgänger. Lucky works to take down [...] "The Balkan", and meets Siobhan McKenna (Chambers), who initially puts an end to his romantic bad luck streak. They face trouble when Siobhan is blackmailed by The Balkan and hides it from Lucky, who is sensitive to betrayal after Elizabeth's affair. They eventually plan a green card marriage so that she can stay in the country with him. During their first ceremony, Lucky learns his son Jake has been in a hit-and-run accident, that eventually renders him braindead. Jake's death sets another string of tragic events in motion. Lucky finds out his father was the driver, and accuses Luke of driving drunk. Lucky is adamant that his father is an alcoholic, but Luke refutes that Lucky wants to blame the alcohol so that he does not have to blame him. Lucky eventually stages an intervention, which only angers Luke. Lucky tracks Luke down to the brothel where Luke grew up, but when Luke tells Lucky that it liberated him to kill Jake, Lucky leaves. Distraught, he burns down his childhood home, accidentally injuring Siobhan. Elizabeth finds Lucky and tells him that he is Aiden's father, stopping Lucky from drinking.
