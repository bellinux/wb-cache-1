Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> at it directly from behind.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{mechanism}} of delayed and uneven germination in sharp tooth oak (Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata) (STO), mechanical scarification techniques were used to study STO root <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> germination <b>and</b> growth. The techniques used were: removing cup scar (RS), removing the pericarp (RP), and cutting off 1 / 2 (HC) and 2 / 3 (TC) cotyledons. Germination percentage <b>and</b> root <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> length for Chinese cabbage (Beassica pekinensis) seeds (CCS) were also investigated for CCS cultivated in a Sanyo growth cabinet watered by distilled water and 80 % methanol extracts from the acorn embryo, cotyledon and pericarp with concentrations of 1. 0 g, 0. 8 g, 0. 6 g and 0. 4 g dry acorn weight per ml methanol. The {{results showed that the}} majority of roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> from acorns with RP and HC treatment emerged two weeks earlier, more simultaneously, and their total emergences were more than 46 % and 28 % higher, respectively. TC accelerated root <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> emergence time <b>and</b> root length, but root <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> germination rate <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> height had no significant difference from the control. Positive consequences were not observed on all indices of RS treatment. The germination rates of CCS watered by 1. 0 g?ml 21 methanol extracts from the embryo and cotyledon were significantly lower than those from the pericarp, and all concentrations resulted in decreased growth of root <b>and</b> <b>shoot.</b> Methanol extracts from pericarp significantly reduced root length of CCS, but presented little response in germination percentage <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> length.

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin affects cell {{elongation}} in both roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots.</b> In roots, the predominant action of auxin is to inhibit cell elongation while in shoots auxin, at normal physiological levels, stimulates elongation. The {{question of whether}} the primary receptor for auxin is the same in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> has not been resolved. In addition to its action on cell elongation in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots,</b> auxin is transported in a polar fashion in both organs. Although auxin transport is well characterized in both roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots,</b> there is relatively little information on the connection, if any, between auxin transport and its action on elongation. In particular, {{it is not clear whether}} the protein mediating polar auxin movement is separate from the protein mediating auxin action on cell elongation or whether these two processes might be mediated by one and the same receptor. We examined the identity of the auxin growth receptor in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> by comparing the response of roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> of the grass Zea mays L. and the legume Vigna mungo L. to indole- 3 -acetic acid, 2 -naphthoxyacetic acid, 4, 6 -dichloroindoleacetic acid, and 4, 7 -dichloroindoleacetic acid. We also studied whether or not a single protein might mediate both auxin transport and auxin action by comparing the polar transport of indole- 3 -acetic acid and 2 -naphthoxyacetic acid through segments from Vigna hypocotyls and maize coleoptiles. For all of the assays performed (root elongation, <b>shoot</b> elongation, <b>and</b> polar transport) the action and transport of the auxin derivatives was much greater in the dicots than in the grass species. The preservation of ligand specificity between roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> the parallels in ligand specificity between auxin transport and auxin action on growth are consistent with the hypothesis that the auxin receptor is the same in roots <b>and</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> that this protein may mediate auxin efflux as well as auxin action in both organ types...|$|R
