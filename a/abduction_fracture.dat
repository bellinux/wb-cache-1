40|$|The {{prognosis}} after {{fracture of}} {{the neck of the}} femur in abduction is supposed to be good. The fracture is usually stable and will heal without nailing. Necrosis of the femoral head may develop as the result of an <b>abduction</b> <b>fracture.</b> It is widely believed, however, that this complication is far less frequent after abduction fractures than after adduction fractures. The main cause of the frequent necrosis after adduction fracture is thought to be the primary displacement, with injury to the vessels supplying the femoral head. Reduction may aggravate the condition further, as may the introduction of a three-flanged nail (Linton 1944). The accepted view on the prognosis after abduction fractures is not founded on extensive data. Surprisingly few papers on this particular type of fracture have been published, and the period of observation has mostly been rather short. It is the aim of this investigation to contribute to the elucidation of the prognosis in abduction fractures, with particular reference to the occurrence of avascular necrosis.

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a virtual test method for {{assessing}} occupant pelvis injury in vehicle frontal crash, {{in order to provide}} relevant biomechanical parameters for occupant safety design. Accordingly, based on the anatomical structure information of a 50 th percentile American male and using LS-DYNA code, a relatively refined finite element model for occupant lower extremity is created with its effectiveness verified by the simulation tests of side impact on pelvis and axial impact on knee-thigh-hip complex. Then a series of virtual tests are conducted on the model to investigate the influence of hip posture with different flexion angles and abduction angles on the failure force of pelvis. The results show that the pelvis fracture location and failure force under axial impact on knee depend on hip posture due to the different strength of various loaded points on acetabulum wall. With the increase of thigh flexion and <b>abduction</b> angles, pelvis <b>fracture</b> location shifts from ilium to acetabulum. The failure force of pelvis goes up with the increase of thigh flexion angle, while it goes up first and then falls down with the rise of thigh abduction angle. The findings of this study provide a reference basis for pelvis injury assessment in vehicle frontal crash safety design...|$|R
