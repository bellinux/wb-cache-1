I say that I attempt to criticise the book 'as far <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is, or <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> to me to be, directed against' us, because it is Mr. Max Muller's occasional habit to argue (apparently) around rather than with his opponents.

Thus a reader does not know whom Mr. Max Muller is opposing, or where he can find the adversary's own statement in his own words. Yet it is usual in such cases, and it is, I think, expedient, to give chapter and verse. Occasionally I find that Mr. Max Muller is honouring me by alluding to observations of my own, but often no reference is given to an opponent's name or books, and we discover the passages in question by accident or research.

Through the findings, researcher was enabled to make suggestions and recommendations on addressing the restrictions and highlighting on the potentials. Building case study and structured interview was used as the method for research. Building case study was conducted on two buildings which are different in typology but both are not from the Traditional Malay Architecture era to examine on how the Climatic Design Principles of Traditional Malay Architecture is being implemented. The structured interviews were carried out among experienced personnel in the built environment (mostly with architecture background) to find out the positive and negative responds towards the implementation of Climatic Design Principles of Traditional Malay Architecture and their reasons for not doing so. The interviewees’ recommendations were also obtained from the interview which structured the solutions.
