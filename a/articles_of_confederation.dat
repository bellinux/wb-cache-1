5|$|Prior to the {{ratification}} {{and implementation of}} the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation,</b> created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation</b> was too weak to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E
5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government would be established. The new Constitution would become operational when ratified by at least nine states. Only then would it replace the existing government under the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation</b> and would apply only to those states that ratified it.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed that}} the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation,</b> and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation</b> were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E

25|$|The first {{thirteen}} {{states were}} formed from British North American colonial territory. Their foundation as states was celebrated at the 200th {{anniversary of the}} ratification of the Constitution {{in a series of}} thirteen stamps, which were issued in the chronological order of ratification between July 4, 1987 and May 29, 1990. The first three stamps—for Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey—appeared in 1987. Nine stamps were issued during 1988 and 1989, with five state commemoratives issued the same day of their ratification: for Massachusetts, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia and New York. Rhode Island’s commemorative was issued on May 29, 1990. The thirteen states ratified the Constitution in half the time it had taken to ratify the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederations.</b>|$|R
5|$|As the war {{had ended}} with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation,</b> resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory. The rebellion {{was one of the}} major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation.</b> On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the United States Constitution.|$|E
5|$|From March 1781, the Congress of the Confederation and the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were {{situated}} at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia.

40|$|Marcin Niemyjski - BiałystokFrom {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the interregnum representatives of the Epi- scopate actively contributed to political discussions and work on the content <b>of</b> the <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Confederation</b> <b>of</b> Warsaw. The <b>articles</b> regulated mutual relationship between Catholicism and various fractions of Protestantism in the Commonwealth. Being so involved, representatives of the Episcopate must have seen and estimated the problem properly, which led to making the best, for the state, decisions. Yet, due to various factors, this responsible civic attitude turned out to be extremely short-lasting. Uchański was influenced by Commendoni’s blackmail. The bishops, in my opinion, refused to validate the confederation, be- cause they feared the political, economic and, as a result, material consequences the act might bring for them. Mainly because of these reasons, even before the end of the convocational proceedings, the bishops started a stout campaign in favour of the abolition <b>of</b> the <b>confederation</b> and they continued it till the end of the interregnum. In consequence of these activities, Henry of Valois con- firmed neither the <b>confederation</b> nor any <b>of</b> the presented to him conditions of the election. Among the members of the Episcopate, the only bishops to thoroughly sup- port the confederation throughout their lives were bishop Krasiński and bishop Secygniowski...|$|R
5|$|Congress tabled {{the draft}} of the {{declaration}} on Monday, July 1 and resolved itself into a committee of the whole, with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence. John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation.</b> John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.|$|E
5|$|Following {{contentious}} {{battles in}} several states, the proposed Constitution reached that nine state ratification plateau in June 1788. On September 13, 1788, the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation</b> Congress certified {{that the new}} Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for the new system to be implemented and directed the new government to meet in New York City on the first Wednesday in March the following year. On March 4, 1789, the new frame of government came into force with eleven of the thirteen states participating.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Hamilton served {{yet another}} term in what {{proved to be}} the last session of the Continental Congress under the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation.</b> When the term of Philip Schuyler was up in 1791, elected in his place was the {{attorney}} general of New York, one Aaron Burr. Hamilton blamed Burr for this result, and ill characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter. The two men did work together from time to time thereafter on various projects, including Hamilton's army of 1798 and the Manhattan Water Company.|$|E
50|$|In 1767-1768, Russian forces {{forced the}} Polish {{parliament}} (Sejm) to pass resolutions they demanded. Many {{of the conservative}} nobility felt anger at that foreign interference, at the perceived weakness of the presiding government under king Stanisław II Augustus (reigned 1764-1795), and at the provisions, particularly the ones that empowered non-Catholics, and at other reforms which they saw as threatening the Golden Freedoms of the Polish nobility. In response to that, and particularly after Russian troops arrested and exiled several vocal opponents (namely bishop of Kiev Józef Andrzej Załuski, bishop of Cracow Kajetan Sołtyk, and Field Crown Hetman Wacław Rzewuski with his son Seweryn), Polish magnates Adam Krasiński, Bishop of Kamieniec, Casimir Pulaski and Michał Krasiński and their allies decided to form a confederatio - a legal military association opposing the government in accordance with Polish constitutional traditions. The <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>confederation</b> were signed on 29 February 1768 at the fortress of Bar in Podolia. Some of the instigators <b>of</b> the <b>confederation</b> included Adam Stanisław Krasiński, Michał Hieronim Krasiński, Kajetan Sołtyk, Wacław Rzewuski, Michał Jan Pac, Jerzy August Mniszech, Joachim Potocki and Teodor Wessel. Priest Marek Jandołowicz was a notable religious leader, and Michał Wielhorski the Confederation's political ideologue.|$|R
40|$|Understandably, the {{soldiers}} and officers were restless. The war had been under way for seven hard years. Under the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Confederation,</b> the Congress {{was too weak to}} fulfill its obligations. The men had left their farms and shops to risk their lives for independence. Not only had their farms and shops suffered neglect, but they were owed considerable back pay, land, and pensions. Many officers were on furlough for the winter, but a number of those who remained were seething with discontent. During that cold, cloudy March of 1783, several began to circulate a letter that called on the army to march on Congress. Wasn 2 ̆ 7 t that the remedy since time immemorial? Washington caught wind of the officers 2 ̆ 7 scheme and forcefully intervened. He told them to assemble in the Temple of Virtue on March 15, the Ides of March. There he confronted his officers. In a speech that moved them deeply, he said that he would not tolerate any more talk of his army marching on Congress. The life of the young republic was at stake; their honor as Americans and as men was at stake. They had sacrificed too much to throw it all away now. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{impeachment}} of President Clinton has reinvigorated {{the debate over}} Congress 2 ̆ 7 s authority to employ devices such as special counsels and independent agencies to restrict the President 2 ̆ 7 s control over {{the administration of the}} law. The initial debate focused on whether the Constitution rejected the 2 ̆ 2 executive by committee 2 ̆ 2 employed by the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Confederation</b> in favor <b>of</b> a 2 ̆ 2 unitary executive, 2 ̆ 2 in which all administrative authority is centralized in the President. More recently, the debate has begun to turn towards historical practices. Some scholars have suggested that independent agencies and special counsels have become such established features of the constitutional landscape as to preempt arguments in favor of the unitary executive. Others, led by Bruce Ackerman, have suggested that the New Deal represented a 2 ̆ 2 constitutional moment 2 ̆ 2 that ratified major changes in the distribution of power within the federal government. Still others have argued that the increased policymaking functions of the modern administrative state justify permitting Congress to impose greater limits on presidential control over the execution of the law. To date, however, a complete assessment of the historical record has yet to appear...|$|R
5|$|The Constitutional Convention convened by the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation</b> Congress in 1787 {{provided}} for a ratification {{process in the}} states that was duly transmitted by Congress to each state. As Virginians {{went to the polls}} to elect delegates to its state convention, six states had ratified including the two other largest states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. But Virginia bisected the new nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River; its admission into the prospective union was critical if the United States as a nation-state were to have contiguous continental territory.|$|E
5|$|When he had {{resigned}} as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a {{delegate to the}} Continental Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification of the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation</b> in 1781.

Congress elected Hancock to serve as its president, but he never attended because of his poor health {{and because he was}} not interested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in 1786.|$|E
5|$|A new U.S. federal {{government}} began operating in 1789, following the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution. The previous central government under the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation</b> {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E

5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confederation,</b> a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command.
