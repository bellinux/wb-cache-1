40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examined perceptions about <b>American</b> fast <b>food</b> among urban, Beijing residents to explore three major objectives; perceptions about taste preferences and nutrition value, the eating relationships of group harmony and sharing dishes, {{and the modern}} values of fast and convenient food in a clean environment. The 40 semi-structured interviews were completed {{in the summer of}} 2011. The informants were selected by age, gender, and occupation. Younger informants, 18 to 30 years old, were exposed to <b>American</b> fast <b>food</b> during their childhood and adolescent periods. Older informants, over 40 years old, did not come into contact with <b>American</b> fast <b>food</b> until they had already established their food consumption patterns.    The findings reveal few differences between younger and older informants because all informants restrict some <b>American</b> fast <b>food</b> consumption for both taste and health reasons. <b>American</b> fast <b>food</b> is only suitable to about half of the informants' taste palatability. They all prefer Chinese cuisine when given the choice. They perceive <b>American</b> fast <b>food</b> to be unhealthy because it uses food adulterants, contains high fat content, and lacks balance between food groups. Families eating together avoid <b>American</b> fast <b>food</b> restaurants to maintain group harmony. However, younger informants enjoy <b>American</b> style fast <b>food</b> because it provides a modern environment to socialize with friends.   M. A...|$|R
