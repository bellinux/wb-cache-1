40|$|Phytate (any salt of {{myo-inositol}} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexakis (dihydrogen phosphate) or InsP 6) {{represents the}} major binding form of phosphorus (P) in plant seeds. In the digestive tract, availability of P from plant seeds and feedstuffs obtained thereof largely {{depends on the}} enzymatic hydrolysis of InsP 6 and less phosphorylated inositol phosphate isomers (InsPs). High prices of mineral P supplements and environmental burden linked with excessive P excretion of animals as well as exhaustion of the global rock phosphate stores demand for maximization of phytate-P utilization in animal feeding. The major objective of this thesis was to understand better InsP 6 hydrolysis and formation of lower InsPs in different segments of the digestive tract of broilers {{and how they can}} be influenced by different dietary factors. In the first study (Manuscript 1), broilers (n= 10 pens per dietary treatment) were fed low-P (5. 2 g/kg DM) corn-soybean meal-based diets without (basal diet) or with one of three different phytase supplements (an Aspergillus and two E. coli derived phytases) from days 16 to 25 of age. InsP 6 hydrolysis until the lower ileum (74 %) of birds fed the basal diet indicated a high potential of broilers and their gut microbiota to hydrolyse InsP 6 in low-P diets. Different InsP pattern in different gut segments suggested the involvement of phosphatases of mucosal or microbial origin. Supplemented phytases significantly increased InsP 6 hydrolysis in the crop but not in the lower ileum. Measurements in the crop and proventriculus/gizzard confirmed published in vitro degradation pathways of 3 - and 6 -phytases {{for the first time in}} broilers. Presence of InsP 4 and InsP 5 isomers specifically formed by different supplemented phytases indicated activity of these enzymes still in the small intestine. InsP 4 accumulation differed between the 6 - and 3 -phytases in the anterior segments of the gut. In the second study (Manuscript 2), effects of supplemental mineral P were studied using different basal diets. Semi-synthetic and corn-soybean meal-based basal diets (experiment 1), or corn-based and wheat-based basal diets were used (experiment 2). <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MSPa) or monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPh) was supplemented to increment the P concentration by 0. 05, 0. 10, and 0. 15 % or by 0. 075 and 0. 150 % in experiment 1 and 2, respectively. In experiment 1, total excreta were collected from day 20 to 24 of age (7 replicated birds per diet). In experiment 2, digesta from the terminal ileum was collected when broilers were 22 days old (5 replicated pens per diet, 19 birds per pen). No differences were found in InsP 6 hydrolysis between the maize- and wheat-based diets (experiment 2). Mineral P supplements significantly decreased InsP 6 hydrolysis from the InsP-containing diets in both experiments. The choice of the basal diet did not affect the evaluation of the supplemented mineral P sources. This lead to the conclusion that calculated availability values for mineral P sources need to be adjusted for the decline in hydrolysis of InsP contained in the basal diet resulting from the P supplement. In the third study (Manuscript 3), broilers (20 birds per pen; n= 8 pens per treatment) were fed two low-P corn-soybean meal-based diets without (BD-; 4. 4 g P/kg DM) or with monocalcium phosphate (MCP) (BD+; 5. 2 g P/kg DM) and without or with added phytase at 500 or 12, 500 FTU/kg from days 15 to 24 of age. Digesta samples were taken from the duodenum/jejunum and lower ileum. Another 180 broilers (n= 6 pens per treatment, 10 birds each) were fed the three BD+ diets from day 1 to 21 of age to assess the influence of supplemented phytase on tibia mineralization and strength. Interactions between MCP and phytase affected InsP 6 hydrolysis and the concentrations of specific lower InsPs. Supplementation with 12, 500 FTU/kg phytase resulted in 92 % prececal InsP 6 hydrolysis and strong degradation of InsP 5. This resulted in higher P net absorption, affirmed by higher body weight gain, tibia strength, and mineralization compared to treatments without or with 500 FTU/kg of phytase. MCP supplementation reduced InsP 6 hydrolysis and the degradation of specific lower InsPs in birds fed diets without phytase or with 500 FTU/kg of phytase, but did not reduce InsP 6 hydrolysis or degradation of InsP 5 at the high phytase dose. Hence effects of added MCP on phytase efficacy depend on the dose of supplemented phytase. In the fourth study (Manuscript 4), broilers (15 birds per pen, n= 8 pens per treatment) were fed a wheat-soybean meal diet low in P (4. 8 g/kg DM) and containing either microwave-treated (BDTW; 121 U/kg of phytase) or non-microwave treated (BDUTW; 623 U/kg of phytase) wheat meal from d 16 to 23 of age. Diets were used without or with supplementation of a phytase, alone or in combination with a xylanase. Interactions between microwave treatment and enzyme supplementation were found for InsP 6 hydrolysis in the ileum and P net absorption in the duodenum/jejunum and ileum. In the ileum, P net absorption was similar, but InsP 6 hydrolysis was significantly higher for BDTW (78 %) than for BDUTW (69 %) in the absence of supplemental phytase. Microwaving may have disrupted wheat aleurone structures in ways that increased the accessibility of the phytate and may have encouraged higher levels of activity among specific phytases of microbial or endogenous mucosal origin in the lower small intestine. In both segments, InsP 6 hydrolysis and P net absorption were significantly increased by supplementation of phytase, but no further by additional supplementation of xylanase. In birds that were fed the phytase-supplemented diets, microwave treatment of wheat had no effect on InsP 6 hydrolysis, but it significantly reduced P net absorption in both segments. The fifth study compromised two experiments (Manuscript 5) in which the influence of different dietary factors on InsP 6 degradation in the crop was investigated. The experimental designs was as mentioned for Manuscript 3 (experiment 2) and 4 (experiment 1) since the samples were taken in the same trials. In experiment 1, InsP 6 hydrolysis in the crop was significantly increased by supplementation of phytase, but not further by the additional supplementation of xylanase. Microwave treatment of wheat reduced InsP 6 hydrolysis and degradation of InsP 5, due to reduction in intrinsic enzyme activity. The effect of 500 FTU/kg of supplemental phytase on InsP 6 hydrolysis was much higher in broilers fed the maize- compared to those fed the wheat-based diets (experiment 2 and 1). Thus, for supplemental phytase the accessibility of phytate in wheat seems to be lower than in maize, perhaps due to different storage sites. Supplementation of 12, 500 FTU/kg of phytase caused high InsP 6 hydrolysis (up to 80 %) and stronger degradation of InsP 3 - 5 than supplementation of 500 FTU/kg (experiment 2). In both experiments, degradation of Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 4 was a limiting step in the breakdown process of InsP 6 by the supplemented phytase. However, upon phytase supplementation Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 4 accumulated in BDTW diets whereas InsP 4 degradation proceeded in untreated wheat diets (experiment 1). Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 4 seemed to be degraded synergistically by intrinsic wheat phosphatases and the supplemented phytase. Taking all studies together, it can be concluded that broilers and their gut microbiota have a very high potential to hydrolyze InsP 6 in the digestive tract when diets low in P and Ca are fed. Differences in the concentrations of lower InsPs showed that the initial step of InsP 6 hydrolysis is not the only catabolic step influenced by different dietary factors. To optimize efficacy of phytases and achieve a maximal InsP degradation and minimal P excretions the separate and interactive effects of different dietary influencing factors on InsP hydrolysis need to be better understood and considered in future diet formulations. In pflanzlichen Samen liegt Phosphor (P) überwiegend in Form von Phytat (Salze von Myo-Inositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -Hexakisdihydrogenphosphat oder InsP 6) vor. Daher hängt die P-Verfügbarkeit aus pflanzlichen Futtermitteln, die aus Samen hergestellt werden, im Verdauungstrakt hauptsächlich von der enzymatischen Hydrolyse von InsP 6 und von niederen Inositolphosphat-Isomeren (InsPs) ab. Aufgrund der hohen Preise für mineralischen P, der ökologischen Relevanz übermäßiger P-Ausscheidungen sowie der Erschöpfung mineralischer P-Reserven gewinnen Erkenntnisse zur Maximierung der Verwertbarkeit von Phytat-P in der Geflügelernährung zunehmend an Bedeutung. Das Hauptziel dieser Arbeit war daher, die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse und die Bildung niederer InsPs in verschiedenen Abschnitten des Verdauungstraktes beim Broiler besser zu verstehen. Zudem wurde der Einfluss verschiedener Fütterungsfaktoren und deren Interaktionen untersucht. In der ersten Studie (Manuskript 1) wurden P-arme (5. 2 g P/kg TM), auf Mais und Sojaextraktionsschrot basierende Rationen ohne (Basalration) oder mit Zulage einer von drei Phytasen (eine Aspergillus- und zwei E. coli-Phytasen) (16. - 25. Lebenstag, n= 10 Abteile pro Behandlung mit je 15 Broilern) eingesetzt. Die hohe InsP 6 -Hydrolyse (74 %) bis zum Ende des Ileums der mit der Basalration gefütterten Tiere deutete auf ein hohes Potenzial des Broilers und dessen Mikrobiota zur InsP 6 -Hydrolyse hin. Unterschiedliche InsP-Muster zwischen den Abschnitten des Verdauungstraktes lassen auf die Beteiligung von Phosphatasen mukosaler und mikrobieller Herkunft schließen. Die Phytasezulage erhöhte die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse im Kropf, jedoch nicht im Ileum. Die Ergebnisse im Kropf und Drüsen-/Muskelmagen bestätigten die in der Literatur beschriebenen in vitro-Abbauwege von 3 - und 6 -Phytasen zum ersten Mal im Broiler. Im Dünndarm konnten die von den zugelegten Phytasen spezifisch gebildeten InsP 4 - 5 -Isomere noch vorgefunden werden, was auf ihre weitere Aktivität im Dünndarm schließen lässt. Die Akkumulation von InsP 4 in den vorderen Abschnitten des Verdauungstraktes unterschied sich beim Einsatz von 3 - und 6 -Phytasen. In der zweiten Studie (Manuskript 2) wurde der Einfluss der Zulage von mineralischem P und von unterschiedlichen Basalrationen auf die Verfügbarkeit von mineralischem P bestimmt. Es wurden semisynthetische oder auf Mais und Sojaextraktionsschrot (Experiment 1) und auf Mais oder Weizen basierende Rationen (Experiment 2) eingesetzt. Um P-Konzentrationen von 0, 05, 0, 10 und 0, 15 % (Experiment 1) oder 0, 075 % und 0, 15 % (Experiment 2) zu erreichen wurden die Rationen mit wasserfreiem Mononatriumphoshat (MSPa) oder Monocalciumphosphat-Monohydrat (MCPh) ergänzt. Experiment 1 basierte auf Exkrementsammlungen (20. bis 24. Lebenstag, n= 7 Tiere pro Ration), Experiment 2 auf Chymussammlungen (Ileum, 22 Tage alte Broiler, n= 5 Abteile mit jeweils 19 Tieren). Die Weizen- und Mais-basierten Rationen unterschieden sich nicht in der InsP 6 -Hydrolyse. Jedoch reduzierte die Zulage von mineralischem P die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse beim Einsatz der InsP-haltigen Rationen. Die Evaluierung der zugelegten mineralischen P-Quelle wurde demnach nicht von der Wahl der Basalration beeinflusst. Allerdings sollten die für mineralische P-Quellen kalkulierten Werte um die durch die P-Zulage bewirkte Reduktion der InsP-Hydrolyse korrigiert werden. In der dritten Studie (Manuskript 3) wurden zwei P-arme auf Mais und Sojaextraktionsschrot basierende Rationen ohne (BD-; 4. 4 g P/kg TM) oder mit Monocalciumphosphat (MCP) (BD+; 5. 2 g P/kg TM) ohne oder mit Zulage von 500 oder 12. 500 FTU/kg Phytase eingesetzt (15. - 24. Lebenstag, 20 Broiler pro Abteil, n= 8 Abteile pro Behandlung). Es wurden Chymusproben aus dem Duodenum/Jejunum und Ileum entnommen. Um die Wirkung zugelegter Phytase auf die Tibia-Mineralisierung zu untersuchen, wurden weitere 180 Broiler (n= 6 Abteile pro Behandlung mit je 10 Tieren, 1. - 21. Lebenstag) mit den drei BD+ Rationen gefüttert. Es traten Interaktionen zwischen MCP und Phytase bezüglich der InsP 6 -Hydrolyse sowie den Konzentrationen spezifischer niederer InsPs auf. Die Zulage von 12. 500 FTU/kg Phytase ermöglichte eine InsP 6 -Hydrolyse von 92 % sowie einen starken Abbau von InsP 5. Zudem war die P-Nettoabsorption mit Zulage von 12. 500 FTU/kg Phytase signifikant höher als ohne oder mit Zulage von 500 FTU/kg. Dies wurde durch eine höhere Lebendmassezunahme sowie durch eine höhere Tibia-Mineralisierung bestätigt. Unter der Verwendung der Rationen ohne oder mit 500 FTU/kg Phytase bewirkte die Zulage von MCP eine Reduktion der InsP 6 -Hydrolyse sowie einen reduzierten Abbau spezifischer niederer InsPs. Beim Einsatz von 12. 500 FTU/kg Phytase hatte die Zulage von MCP keinen Einfluss auf die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse oder den Abbau von InsP 5. Der Einfluss von zugelegtem MCP auf die Phytaseeffizienz hängt somit von der Phytasedosis ab. In der vierten Studie (Manuskript 4) wurden auf Weizen und Sojaextraktionsschrot basierende P-arme (4. 8 g/kg TM) Rationen, welche entweder mikrowellenbehandelten (BDTW; 121 U/kg Phytase) oder nicht mikrowellenbehandelten Weizenschrot (BDUTW; 623 U/kg Phytase) enthielten, eingesetzt. Die Rationen wurden ohne oder mit Zulage einer Phytase allein oder in Kombination mit Xylanase verwendet (16. - 23. Lebenstag, 15 Broiler pro Abteil, n= 8 Abteile pro Behandlung). Zwischen der Mikrowellenbehandlung und der Enzymzulage traten Interaktionen bezüglich der InsP 6 -Hydrolyse im Ileum und der P-Nettoabsorption im Duodenum/Jejunum und Ileum auf. Ohne Enzymzulage war die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse im Ileum signifikant höher für BDTW (78 %) verglichen mit BDUTW (69 %), wohingegen die P-Nettoabsorption gleich war. Es ist anzunehmen, dass durch die Mikrowellenbehandlung Strukturen in der Aleuronschicht des Weizens zerstört wurden, was die Zugänglichkeit des darin vorkommenden Phytates erhöht haben könnte. Durch die Mikrowellenbehandlung könnte die Aktivität spezifischer mikrobieller und endogener Mukosaphytasen im Darm angestiegen sein. Die Phytasezulage erhöhte die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse und P-Nettoabsorption in beiden Abschnitten. Die Kombination mit Xylanase erzielte keine weitere Steigerung. Mit Enzymzulage wurde durch die Mikrowellenbehandlung die P-Nettoabsorption, nicht aber die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse, reduziert. Die letzte Studie umfasste zwei Experimente (Manuskript 5), die den Einfluss von Fütterungsfaktoren auf den InsP 6 -Abbau im Kropf untersuchten. Das Versuchsdesign entsprach dem in Manuskript 3 (Experiment 2) und 4 (Experiment 1) beschriebenen Design. In Experiment 1 erhöhte die Phytasezulage die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse. Die Kombination mit Xylanase erzielte keine weitere Steigerung. Infolge der reduzierten intrinsischen Phytaseaktivität wurden die InsP 6 -Hydrolyse und der Abbau von InsP 5 durch die Mikrowellenbehandlung des Weizens vermindert. Die Steigerung der InsP 6 -Hydrolyse, die durch die Zulage von 500 FTU/kg Phytase erreicht wurde, war weitaus höher unter Verwendung der Mais- (Experiment 2) als unter Verwendung der Weizen-basierten Ration (Experiment 1). Demnach scheint das Phytat in Mais für die zugelegte Phytase besser zugänglich zu sein als das Phytat in Weizen, was auf die unterschiedlichen Speicherorte zurückzuführen sein kann. Mit Zulage von 12. 500 FTU/kg Phytase wurde eine sehr hohe InsP 6 -Hydrolyse (bis zu 80 %) sowie ein stärkerer Abbau von InsP 3 - 5 als mit der Zulage von 500 FTU/kg Phytase erreicht (Experiment 2). Beide Experimente zeigten, dass der Abbau von Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 4 einen limitierenden Schritt beim InsP 6 -Abbau durch die zugelegte Phytase darstellt. Jedoch scheinen die zugelegte Phytase und Phosphatasen aus Weizen Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 4 synergistisch abzubauen, da die Phytasezulage eine Akkumulation von Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 4 bei BDTW, hingegen nicht bei BDUTW bewirkte (Experiment 1). Aus den Ergebnissen der vorliegenden Arbeit lässt sich schlussfolgern, dass Masthühner zusammen mit ihrer Mikrobiota bei Verwendung von P- und Ca-armen Rationen ein hohes Potenzial zur InsP 6 -Hydrolyse im Dünndarm aufweisen. Unterschiede in den Konzentrationen niederer InsPs zeigten, dass die Abspaltung der ersten Phosphatgruppe beim InsP 6 -Abbau im Verdauungstrakt nicht der einzige katabole Schritt ist, der von verschiedenen Fütterungsfaktoren und deren Interaktionen beeinflusst wird. Um die Effizienz von Phytasen zu optimieren, einen maximalen InsP-Abbau zur erreichen, den P-Bedarf des Tieres exakter zu treffen und die P-Ausscheidungen zu minimieren müssen in zukünftigen Rationsgestaltungen der Einfluss dieser Faktoren sowie deren Interaktionen auf die InsP-Hydrolyse berücksichtigt werden...|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of phosphoproteins and phenol-bound proteins into the cuticle of Periplaneta americana was analyzed.

Phosphoproteins were observed to be combined with the cuticle {{to a greater extent}} than <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> This suggests that phosphate is being incorporated into the cuticle more readily than <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The relevance of these observations is discussed in light of phosphate being a possible crosslinking agent between chitin and cuticle protein. Binding of dopamine metabolites to cuticle proteins was investigated. Specific metabolites studied were N-acetyldopamine- 3 - 0 -sulphate and dopamine- 3 - 0 -sulphate. In an in vitro experiment, these metabolites were readily bound to cuticular, structural proteins while they remained unchanged when incubated with soluble cuticular proteins. The presence of sulphatase activity was also evidenced in the structural proteins but not in the soluble proteins. The binding of N-acetyldopamine to lysyl-lysine was accomplished in vitro. Binding was observed with and without newly ecdysed cuticle homogenate. The products of the binding were separated wia P- 2 polyacrylamide gel chromatography, paper chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis. Absorbancy at 280 nm, as well as the reaction with ninhydrin were monitored for each fraction. A metabolite (or metabolites) was separated which was both UV positive and ninhydrin positive.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the relative bioavailability of phosphorus (P) in peas for 21 -day old broiler chickens using slope-ratio assay. One hundred and sixty eight male Ross 308 broiler chicks were divided into 42 groups 4 balanced for body weight and fed 7 diets in a completely randomized design (6 groups/diet) from day 1 to 21 of age. The diets were a corn-soybean meal basal diet, and the corn-soybean meal basal diet to which <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> brown- or yellow-seeded pea was added at the expense of cornstarch to supply 0. 5 % or 1 % total phosphorus. <b>Monosodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> was included as a reference, and hence the estimated bioavailability of P in pea cultivars was relative to that in the <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Birds and feed were weighed weekly and on d 21 they were killed to obtain tibia. The brown-seeded pea contained 23. 4 % crude protein, 0. 47 % P, whereas the yellow-seeded pea contained 24. 3 % crude protein and 0. 38 % P. Increasing dietary P supply improved (p< 0. 05) chick body weight gain and tibia ash and bone density. The estimated relative bioavailability of p values for brown- and yellow-seeded peas obtained using final body weight, average daily gain, tibia ash, and bone mineral density were 31. 5 % and 36. 2 %, 35. 6 % and 37. 3 %, 23. 0 % and 5. 60 %, and 40. 3 % and 30. 3 %, respectively. The estimated relative bioavailability of p values for brown- and yellow-seeded peas did not differ within each of the response criteria measured in this study. In conclusion, the relative bioavailability of P in pea did not differ depending on the cultivar (brown- vs yellow-seed).

40|$|Buffering {{agents are}} widely used to {{stabilise}} the pH of solutions in soft matter and biological sciences. They are typically composed of weak acids and bases mixed in an aqueous solution, and can interact electrostatically with charged surfaces such as biomembranes. Buffers can induce protein aggregation and structural modification of soft interfaces, but a molecular-level picture is still lacking. Here we use high-resolution atomic force microscopy to investigate the effect of five commonly used buffers, namely 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) piperazine- 1 -ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 -(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> saline sodium citrate (SSC) and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) on the hydration landscape of Muscovite mica in solution.

SSC, Tris and <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> tend to create an amorphous mesh layer several molecules thick and with no preferential ordering. In contrast, MES and HEPES adopt epitaxial arrangements commensurate with the underlying mica lattice, suggesting that they offer the most suitable solution for high-resolution studies. To confirm that this effect persisted in biologically-relevant interfaces, the experiments were repeated on a silica-supported lipid bilayer. Similar trends were observed for this system using atomic force microscopy as well as ellipsometry.

This mixture is incorporated in polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) articles intended to be in contact with foodstuffs for hot fill/pasteurisation and/or long term storage at room temperature. For dried and fatty foods, {{direct contact with the}} materials is envisaged whereas other food types will be separated from the active material by a layer that does not contain the active components. All the substances constituting the oxygen absorber system have been evaluated and authorised for use as plastic food contact materials, as food additives or as food supplements. Based on migration results, the specific migration limits for iron, polyethyleneglycol, pyrophosphoric acid salts, phosphoric acid salts and sodium chloride, and the tolerable intake of phosphorus (phosphate) are not expected to be exceeded when the oxygen absorber system is used under the intended conditions of use, notably behind a layer not containing the active substance for contact with aqueous or acidic foods. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the substances, iron, polyethyleneglycol, disodium pyrophosphate, <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and sodium chloride do not raise a safety concern when used as oxygen absorbers incorporated in polyethylene and in polypropylene articles used for long time storage and/or hot fill up to 95 °C for several minutes in i) direct contact with dry and fatty foods and ii) indirect contact with aqueous or acidic foods, separated from the active material by a layer of at least 10 µm polyethylene or polypropylene that does not contain the oxygen absorber formulation...|$|R

In this study, various salts and salt combinations were studied as alternatives to sodium chloride. Included were: (1) Sodium chloride; (2) Calcium chloride; (3) Potassium acetate (and chloride mixtures); (4) Calcium magnesium acetate (and chloride mixtures); (5) <b>Monosodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> plus chlorides; (6) Monopotassium phosphate plus chlorides; (7) Monocalcium phosphate plus chlorides. Several solution concentrations were used but the base concentration for comparison of the salts and mixtures was 0. 5 molality. The salt solutions were used in tests to measure the following properties: (1) Ice melting; (2) Mortar scaling; (3) Metal corrosion. These properties, as well as estimates of cost and possible environmental damage were considered in a criterion function analysis. It was found that <b>monosodium</b> and monopotassium <b>phosphates,</b> in combination with sodium chloride, were {{the best choice for}} use as a deicer. A phosphate and sodium chloride mixture in the ratio of 1 : 9 was found to be the best combination.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} coconut water with a lone concentration and different concentrations of glycerol on chilled and cryopreserved cattle semen characteristics. Methods: Semen was collected from five mature cattle bulls, at weekly intervals for 5 weeks. The ejaculates were pooled and evaluated for dilution processing. Tris citrate egg yolk fructose was used as control treatment for semen, while 50 % (V/V) coconut water, 25 % (V/V) bidistilled water and 25 % (V/V, 5 % <b>anhydrous</b> <b>monosodium</b> citrate) to 20 mL egg yolk and three different concentrations of glycerol (4 %, 6 % and 8 %) were used as coconut water (CW) - glycerol-yolk extenders (CWCG- 4, CWCG- 6 and CWCG- 8). Extended semen was cooled and cryopreserved. Sperm motility%, sperm membrane integrity%, normal acrosome%, live sperm% and total sperm abnormalities% were recorded after equilibrium and after freezethawing. Results: The addition of 4 % glycerol to coconut water enriched media (CWCG- 4) revealed the most effective addition of glycerol on all parameters after equilibrium and after freeze-thawing. Conclusions: Coconut water enriched media with 4 % glycerol addition is safe {{to be used as}} an extender in bull semen preservation because it is a sterile liquid.

Milk production was 23 ± 4 kg per day {{at the onset of}} the trial (DIM 185 ± 11). Different quantities of <b>monosodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MSP) were added to a basal diet to obtain daily P intake levels of 44, 67, 92, 117 and 142 g (2. 4, 3. 7, 5. 1, 6. 4 and 7. 8 g P kg¿ 1 of DM, respectively).

40|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} (HPLC) is a progressive analytical method used for {{qualitative and quantitative}} drug analysis. This work describes various modifications of the chromatographic method for determining of BSIH (isonicotinic acid [2 -(4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethyl-[1, 3, 2]dioxaborolan- 2 -yl) - benzylidene]-hydrazide) and SIH (salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone) in rabbit plasma. BSIH belongs to prochelators which convert to iron chelator SIH {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide. Increased stability in plasma and lower toxicity even during repetitive administration is the advantage of BSIH. Separation of BSIH, SIH and internal standard (o- 108) was tested on various stationary phases using different chromatographic conditions.

In order to screen optimal P fertilizer for As-phytoremediation, a greenhouse study was conducted on the growth, As-accumulation and uptake of N, P and K by Pteris vittata L. in As-contaminated soils with different forms of P fertilizers. The results indicated that the biomass of plant with As addition decreased compared to no As-addition treatments except fused calcium magnesium phosphate (CaMg-P) treatment. The plants in As addition soils with CaMg-P, calcium dihydrogen phosphate (CDP) and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) had higher biomass than those with other P fertilizer and control (0. 83 g/pot). The As accumulations of plant aboveground in As addition soils are in order of CDP > CaMg-P > DAP > Potassium <b>Phosphate</b> Monobasic > <b>Monosodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> > control very much greater than Calcium superphosphate. The efficiency of As removal from As addition soils with CDP was the highest, 7. 28 %.
