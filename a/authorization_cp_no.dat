40|$|The {{reactions}} of transition metal (TM) hydrides (<b>Cp)</b> Re(H) (<b>NO)</b> (CO), (<b>Cp)</b> Ru(H) (CO) (PH 3), and (<b>Cp)</b> Re(H) (<b>NO)</b> (PH 3) with poor, moderate, and strong proton donors HR (H 2 O, HOCF 3, and H 3 O+) are studied using DFT B 3 PW 91. The reaction pathway {{depends on the}} relative proton-attracting powers of the TM and hydride H atoms, {{as well as on}} the proton donor ability of HR. In the case where these two atoms have comparable basicity, (<b>Cp)</b> Re(H) (<b>NO)</b> (CO) forms an intermolecular H···H bonding intermediate upon reaction with both poor and strong proton donors H 2 O and H 3 O+. This is followed by rearrangement to η 2 -H 2 by proton transfer over a very small barrier. The reaction of (Cp) Ru(H) (CO) (PH 3) with its highly nucleophilic hydride yields H···H bonding complexes with moderate proton donor HOCF 3, whereas the strong donor H 3 O+ produces only the η 2 -H 2 structure. Rapid rearrangement of η 2 -H 2 to cis-dihydride is possible although the trans-dihydride is more stable. For both types of hydride, a reaction pathway through a H···H bonding complex is preferred over direct interaction of HR with the TM atom, forming the corresponding dihydride. The latter pathway is favored for (<b>Cp)</b> Re(H) (<b>NO)</b> (PH 3), where the TM atom is the more basic. In this case cis- and trans-dihydride complexes form upon reaction with H 3 O+ without any H···H and η 2 -H 2 intermediates. Although the trans-structure is more stable than the cis-, a PH 3 ligand favors the cis-direction of H 3 O+ attack by recoordination of H 2 O from the hydride atom to a hydrogen of the PH 3 group...|$|R

Test–retest percent agreements within one point for children with unilateral CP (and TDC) were Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments: 75 % (90 %); single-point localization: 69 % (97 %); static two-point discrimination: 93 % (97 %); and moving two-point discrimination: 87 % (97 %). Test–retest reliability for registration and unilateral spatial tactile perception tests was high in children with CP (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0. 79 – 0. 96).
