25|$|In August 2017, the {{financial}} intelligence agency Australian Transaction Reports and <b>Analysis</b> <b>Centre</b> (AUSTRAC) launched civil proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging that CBA had breached money laundering and terrorism financing laws on 53,700 occasions.

25|$|Australian {{responses}} to money laundering {{are similar to}} the majority of western countries. The Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) requires 'cash dealers' to report specific information to the Australian Transaction Reports and <b>Analysis</b> <b>Centre.</b> The purposes of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) would be frustrated if accounts could be opened in false names. The Act creates the offence of opening or operating an account in a false name: s 24. It also establishes rigorous procedures that must be followed when opening new accounts when Banking in Australia.The Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) imposes criminal penalties on a person who engages in money laundering. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) attacks the money laundering problem by creating offences and confiscation property.|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} digital {{radiation}} detection systems employing list-mode data collection, which improves data analysis capabilities. Future data acquisition systems shall also ultimately enable {{the movement of}} detection data from first responders electronically to <b>analysis</b> <b>centres</b> rather than the costly and time consuming process of moving experts and/or samples. This new technology is especially useful in crisis events, when time and resources are sparse and increased analysis capacity is required. In order to utilise the opportunities opened by these new technologies, the systems have to be interoperable, so that the data from each type of detector can easily be analysed by different <b>analysis</b> <b>centres.</b> Successful interoperability of the systems requires that European and/or international standards are devised for the digitised data format. The basis of such a format {{is a list of}} registered events detailing an estimate of the energy of the detected radiation, along with an accurate time-stamp for recorded events (and optionally other parameters describing each event).

While the <b>analysis</b> <b>centres</b> on the depth of liberalisation accomplished by the region's RTAs, we preliminarily investigate the extent to which the regional RTAs feature "open regionalism"-liberalisation vis-à-vis third parties.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} limit theories for likelihood {{analysis of}} weak exogeneity in I(2) vector autoregressive models. Conditions for weak exogeneity in I(2) models are reviewed, and the asymptotic {{properties of the}} conditional maximum likelihood estimators and a likelihood-based weak exogeneity test are then investigated. It is proved that the likelihood ratio test statistic for weak exogeneity has an asymp-totic 2 distribution. This paper also considers model reduction procedures for I(2) systems. Finally, an empirical analysis of I(2) data is performed using maximum likelihood estimation. This empirical <b>analysis</b> <b>centres</b> on tests for weak exogeneity and model reduction to achieve parsimonious econometric representations...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} cost calculating have become obsolete. The loss of {{relevance}} of traditional cost calculating systems is mainly {{due to the}} existence of a gap between the current model of enterprise control and the model of <b>analysis</b> <b>centres,</b> as well as the difference between the way of composing the actual cost and its image reflected by managerial accounting. The vision of the company on which the method of <b>analysis</b> <b>centres</b> was based no longer corresponds to the present reality. The approach of this study captures the complex and delicate subject of the allocation of production overheads procedure. Through the field research undertaken, it was aimed to identify and possibly solve the problems related to the rational allocation of these expenditures. The own contributions of the study are highlighted in particular at practical level, as an obvious result of the types of research undertaken. One of the fundamental objectives of the present study is to enhance the interest regarding the practical possibilities of protecting against the dangers of a creative managerial accounting system. A managerial accounting system, once implemented, will also attract the manifestation of creative accounting phenomena, especially in times of crisis. Having at their disposal the most relevant set of information, managers are tempted to resort to more or less ingenious techniques that are more or less questionable and more or less legal, in order to improve the financial statement presentation...|$|R

For Carpenter, sexual education meant forwarding a clear analysis {{of the ways in which}} sex and gender were used to oppress women, contained in Carpenter's radical work Love's Coming-of-Age. In it he argued that a just and equal society must promote the sexual and economic freedom of women. The main crux of his <b>analysis</b> <b>centred</b> on the negative effects of the institution of marriage. He regarded marriage in England as both enforced celibacy and a form of prostitution.|$|R
