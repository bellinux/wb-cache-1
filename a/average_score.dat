40|$|Background. Averaged Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ) support scores {{remove the}} {{influence}} of network size variability but may unduly lower scores for participants with large networks. Objectives. To evaluate the use of <b>averaged</b> NSSQ <b>scores.</b> Method. Pearson correlations determined if <b>averaged</b> <b>scores</b> decreased as network size increased across three samples. Then, Pearson correlations between a criterion variable and both averaged and raw support scores were computed along with the resultant power to detect a true effect. Results. Neither averaged total functional support nor averaged affect and affirmation scores decreased as sample size increased. However, <b>averaged</b> aid <b>scores</b> did decrease as network size increased. Power also increased markedly in all <b>averaged</b> versus raw <b>scores</b> except in <b>averaged</b> aid <b>scores.</b> Discussion and Conclusions. Use of <b>averaged</b> aid <b>scores</b> is not recommended. Use of all other <b>averaged</b> <b>scores</b> appears acceptable...|$|R
