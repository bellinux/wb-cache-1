Huxley statesAgnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle... the fundamental axiom of modern science... In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration...</b> In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable. Use of that term has continued to the present day (see Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism).|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and {{sympathy for the}} Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence {{of the number of}} Irish Catholics in the Battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of senior officers. Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while [...] "there was a portion of truth" [...] in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism, [...] "I have good reason to believe, in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration</b> to produce the deplorable result ," [...] describing how he found the punishments used for [...] "trivial offensives" [...] to be [...] "revolting and disgusting". Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions. For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.|$|E

60|$|Now {{that he was}} {{actually}} in the town where Mary lived he was puzzled to know how to proceed. He had wit enough to know that in Marmion a girl could not receive visits from a strange young man and escape the fire of infuriate gossip.

60|$|What {{representations}} Egerton {{had thought}} proper {{to make to}} his wife, {{we are unable to}} say; but she appeared to resent something, as she never approached the dwelling or persons of her quondam associates, although in her heart she was dying to be on terms of intimacy with their titled friends. Her incorrigible mother was restrained by no such or <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration,</b> and contrived to fasten on the Dowager and Lady Harriet a kind of bowing acquaintance, which she made great use of at the rooms.|$|E
60|$|So it is that, {{in spite}} of their {{apparent}} urgency, I ask the reader to detach himself from these present conflicts of national politics, of political parties and of the class war as completely as he can; or, if he cannot detach himself completely, then to play such a part in them, regardless of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration,</b> as may be most conducive to a wide-thinking, wide-ranging education upon which we can base a new world order. A resolute push for quite a short period now might reconstruct the entire basis of our collective human life.|$|E
60|$|Maraton {{looked past}} {{her into the}} gardens, away into the violet sky. The {{nightingale}} was singing now clearly and wonderfully. Perhaps, for a moment, his thoughts strayed from the great battle of life. Perhaps his innate sense and worship of beauty, the artist in the man, which was the real thing making him great in his daily work, triumphed apart from <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration.</b> The music of life was in his veins. Soft and stately, Elisabeth, standing a little apart, was looking in upon them, an exquisite figure with a background of dark green trees.|$|E
60|$|Quite {{apart from}} <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>considerations,</b> {{one has to}} {{remember}} one entire difference between the possible breeding of human beings and the actual breeding of dogs and horses. We breed dogs and horses for uniformity, for certain very limited specified points--speed, scent and the like. But human beings we should have to breed for variety: we cannot specify any particular points we want. We want statesmen and poets and musicians and philosophers and swift men and strong men and delicate men and brave men. The qualities of one would be the weaknesses of another.|$|R

60|$|For a {{few moments}} Davies studied Gerald's face. He {{wondered}} how much he knew about his plans concerning Allenwood, and, what was more important, whether he might try to thwart them. Young Mowbray was not a fool, and these people from the Old Country had {{a strong sense of}} caste; they stood by one another and were capable of making some sacrifice to protect their common interests against an outsider. If Mowbray had such feelings, he would need careful handling; but Davies was more inclined to think him a degenerate who placed his own safety before <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration.</b>|$|E
60|$|This was {{touching}} Roswell {{on a point}} of honour, and Daggett knew it very well. Generous and determined, {{the young man was}} much more easily influenced by a silent and indirect appeal to his liberal qualities, than he could possibly have been by <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration.</b> The idea of deserting a companion in distress, in a sea like that in which he was, caused him to shrink from what, under other circumstances, he would regard as an imperative duty. The deacon, and still more, Mary, called him north; but the necessities of the Vineyarders would seem to chain him to their fate.|$|E
60|$|The deacon was so confounded {{as to be}} speechless. As for Mary, she {{expressed}} {{her deep}} regrets that the summons should have been so sudden, and that the previous preparation was so small; matters that gave her far more concern than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration.</b> They were not long left to conjectures, the voluble widow soon supplying all the facts that had occurred. It appeared that Daggett died in the night, the widow having found him stiff and cold on visiting his bed-side a few minutes before. That this somewhat unexpected event, as to the time at least, was hastened by {{the excitement of the}} conversation mentioned, there can be little doubt, though no comment was made on the circumstance. The immediate cause of death was suffocation from the effects of suppuration, as so often occurs in rapid consumption.|$|E

To {{discover}} what a young man is good for, and to equip him for the path he is to strike out in life, regardless of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration,</b> is the great duty to which he calls attention. He makes men self-reliant. He reveals to the eyes of the idealist the magnificent results of practical activity, and unfolds before the realist the grandeur of the ideal world of thought. No man is to allow himself, through prejudice, to make a mistake in choosing the task to which he will devote his life. Emerson's essays are, as it were, printed sermons--all having this same text.... The wealth and harmony of his language overpowered and entranced me anew. But even now I cannot say wherein the secret of his influence lies. What he has written is like life itself--the unbroken thread ever lengthened through the addition of the small events which make up each day's experience." ...|$|E
60|$|The nurses of this {{hospital}} are all young,--ranging, say, from nineteen to four and twenty. They have even within these narrow limits, what many well-endowed hospitals {{would not give}} them, a comfortable room of their own in which to take their meals. It is a beautiful truth, that interest in the children and sympathy with their sorrows bind these young women to their places far more strongly than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration</b> could. The best skilled of the nurses came originally from a kindred neighbourhood, almost as poor; and she knew how much the work was needed. She is a fair dressmaker. The hospital cannot pay her as many pounds in the year as there are months in it; and one day the lady regarded it as a duty {{to speak to her}} about her improving her prospects and following her trade. 'No,' she said: she could never be so useful or so happy elsewhere any more; she must stay among the children.|$|E
6000|$|Agnostioism, in fact, {{is not a}} creed, but a method, {{the essence}} of which lies in the {{rigorous}} application of a single principle.

Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration.</b> And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.

I shall limit myself, therefore, to my own simple woodman's work, and try to hew this book into its final shape, with the limited and humble aim that I had in beginning it, namely, to prove how far the idle and peaceable persons, who have hitherto cared about leaves and clouds, have rightly seen, or faithfully reported of them.|$|R
50|$|His {{contribution}} consists {{above all}} of proposing a new method of fascination based on concentrating on a brilliant object, {{a method that}} supposedly produces more constant and more rapid effects {{compared to that of}} the old-fashioned hypnotizers, and a theory based on the concept of mental fatigue. For him, hypnosis is a state of mental concentration during which the faculties of the patient’s spirit are so entirely monopolized by one idea that it becomes indifferent to <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>considerations</b> or influence. Braid uses this method as an anesthetic during surgery. At that time, ether was not yet used in anesthesiology. Discovered in 1818 by Michael Faraday, ether is not used for the first time until 1846, by the American dentist William Morton.|$|R
60|$|Jones {{had married}} Sarah Jane solely with this view; and, indeed, it was highly {{improbable}} {{that he should}} have done so on <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>consideration.</b> Sarah Jane was certainly not a handsome girl. Her neck was scraggy, her arms lean, and her lips thin; and she resembled neither her father nor her mother. Her light brown, sandy hair, which always looked as though it were too thin and too short to adapt itself to any feminine usage, was also not of her family; but her disposition was a compound of the paternal and maternal qualities. She had all her father's painful hesitating timidity, and with it all her mother's grasping spirit. If there ever was an eye that looked sharp after the pence, that could weigh the ounces of a servant's meal at a glance, and foresee and prevent the expenditure of a farthing, it was the eye of Sarah Jane Brown. They say that it is as easy to save a fortune as to make one; and in this way, if in no other, Jones may be said to have got a fortune with his wife.|$|E
6000|$|If any one had {{preferred}} {{this request}} to me I should have replied that, if {{he referred to}} agnostics, they have no creed; and, {{by the nature of}} the case, cannot have any. Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle.

60|$|I {{know of no}} way {{in which}} fair-haired people can be {{prevented}} from {{falling in love with}} dark-haired people; and I do not believe that whether a man was long-headed or round-headed ever made much difference to any one who felt inclined to break his head.

There was the love of a valley or a village, a site or a family; there were enthusiasms for a prince and his hereditary office; there were passions rooted in locality, special emotions about sea-folk or mountain-folk; there were historic memories of a cause or an alliance; there was, more than all, the tremendous test of religion. But of a cause like that of the Celts or Teutons, covering half the earth, there was little or nothing. Race was not only never at any given moment a motive, but it was never even an excuse.

40|$|The general {{aviation}} air traffic flow patterns at uncontrolled airports are investigated and analyzed and traffic pattern concepts are developed {{to minimize the}} midair collision hazard in uncontrolled airspace. An analytical approach to evaluate midair collision hazard probability {{as a function of}} traffic densities is established which is basically independent of path structure. Two methods of generating space-time interrelationships between terminal area aircraft are presented; one is a deterministic model to generate pseudorandom aircraft tracks, the other is a statistical model in preliminary form. Some hazard measures are presented for selected traffic densities. It is concluded that the probability of encountering a hazard should be minimized independently of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>considerations</b> and that the number of encounters involving visible-avoidable aircraft should be maximized at the expense of encounters in other categories...|$|R

Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish paid tribute to Aquilani on his departure, stating that the only reason for the loan was an inability to fit the player into the team's preferred formation.

40|$|One {{eighth of}} the {{terrestrial}} surface are mountains, if surface ruggedness {{is taken as}} a criterion. Topographic roughness and steep climatic gradients over short distances explain the exceptional biological diversity of mountains around the globe. Habitat diversity also safeguards mountain biota against species losses in case of climatic change, {{simply because of the}} mosaics of contrasting micro-environmental conditions that offer short distance escapes. Experimental evidence revealed no benefits of rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations for growth and productivity of alpine plants, but nitrogen deposition bears the risk that slow growing and robust species may become overgrown by vigorous, less robust taxa. Land-use change is likely to exceed the impact of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> environmental change.
