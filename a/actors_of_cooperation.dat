40|$|Studies in {{the field}} of {{sociology}} of innovation and economics of technical change have shown that technologies and their markets are highly intermingled. If we accept that technologies can shape the market, it leads to paying attention to how technologies are designed and developed. Indeed, the characteristics of technologies influence the nature of the competition (network externalities, increasing returns to adoption, [...] .). The importance of co-operative R&D agreements is mostly analysed in terms of successes and failures or in terms of reduction of transaction costs. But, does the mode of development of technics have effects on the characteristics of the technical objects ? The impact of the mode of development of the technics on the characteristics of technics is still mysterious. Could it be that one of the determinants of the characteristics of technologies {{is the way in which}} technological development is organised ? The aim of this paper is to present some hypotheses about the consequence of R&D co-operation on the characteristics of the technical object in an actor network perspective. Thanks to an ethnographic study of the mode of coordination of a Eureka project, the role of technics as a mechanism of coordination is highlighted. Thus, technical choices can be analysed as the result of the identity <b>of</b> the <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation,</b> <b>of</b> their mutual trust and of the form <b>of</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Hence, the form and the nature of the technical object, which shapes the market, are the result of the organisation of its development. ...|$|R

It analyses the objectives that were set, how these objectives were determined and seeks factors that influence the institutional development path. In the first part, the thesis introduces each <b>actor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation</b> separately - on the European Union side, it focuses {{on the construction of}} a coherent European common energy policy, while for Russia it explains the key role of energies in the redefined state policy strategy. In the second part, the author examines common EU-Russia energy institutions, primarily the Energy Dialogue, which was opened in 2000. Despite certain positive results reached in some areas <b>of</b> this <b>cooperation</b> framework, the progress is rather slow due to {{a significant difference in the}} two partners' perception of the policy path towards the mutually formulated goals. The last part specifies and discusses three factors forming the context of the EU-Russia gas trade and, finally, the case studies provide insight into actual events.

40|$|This edited volume {{examines}} the continued viability of {{international human rights}} law {{in the context of}} growing transnational law enforcement. With states increasingly making use of global governance modes, core exercises of public authority such as migration control, surveillance, detention and policing, are increasingly conducted extraterritorially, outsourced to foreign governments or delegated to non-state <b>actors.</b> New forms <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> raise difficult questions about divided, shared and joint responsibility under international human rights law. At the same time, some governments engage in transnational law enforcement exactly to avoid such responsibilities, creatively seeking to navigate the complex, overlapping and sometimes unclear bodies of international law. As such, this volume argues that this area represents a particular dark side of globalisation, requiring both scholars and practitioners to revisit basic assumptions and legal strategies...|$|R
40|$|The MDGs {{represent}} a concerted project that {{gave birth to}} unprecedented synergetic efforts. Ever since their enunciation, they became the focus of political discussions and actions in the field of economic and social development, meetings and conferences were held regularly in order to reaffirm their importance, their effort and to evaluate the accomplished progress. Among the Goals, the creation of a global partnership for development is often considered the weak link in the chain, whether in relation to the difficulties for the main <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation</b> for development policies to converge on common goals through constructive dialogue aimed at efficient and effective actions, or for the need to define new forms <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> that would start from the comparison and the involvement <b>of</b> the non-institutional <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> civil life. In this perspective, the UN urged the adoption of a public and a participatory process bottom-up aimed at analyzing the progress and the achievements in relation to the development and the elaboration of new proposals, {{in such a way as}} to shape the priorities by creating a stronger sense of belonging to the community. For this purpose, a series of consultations has been initiated to meet the request for greater participation in the formation of a new agenda for the post- 2015 development, which is an innovation and an achievement for the adopted methods and for the aroused interest. This research aims to analyze what the contribution of these consultations to the global debate is, which help to reveal people's priorities and to provide key inputs to the discussion of a post- 2015 future development program. At the same time, it explores the potentialities <b>of</b> a synergic <b>cooperation</b> as the fundamental link between international development cooperation, decentralized cooperation and territorial <b>cooperation,</b> a source <b>of</b> renewal in the conception of development based on participation, rights and freedoms, strengthening territorial capacity in the global context and the creation of a network of exchanges that constitute the platform for the construction of new multidimensional development policies...|$|R

40|$|By {{adopting}} the Policy for Global Development (PGD) in 2003 the Swedish parliament established gender mainstreaming {{as a goal}} in development cooperation policy, thereby emphasizing women’s role as agents of empowerment in development. This {{has not always been}} the case. During most of the history of Swedish foreign aid women issues have been handled separately and development policy mainly based on a male perspective. A lot of research has focused on trends in the global debate over how to better integrate women in development process, but much less academic attention has focused on how Swedish development policy has addressed the issue and how women have been referred to in development policy since the origin of Swedish foreign aid. According to the theories of critical discourse analysis (CDA) our written and spoken language influence our view of the reality and how we understand society. Following that logic, how women are referred to in Swedish development policy influence how women are perceived by the <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> development <b>cooperation.</b> Through a critical discourse analysis of official Swedish governmental documents concerning foreign aid, such as government bills and letters of appropriation, this study aims to detect discourses of Swedish development policy regarding women in developing countries. Furthermore it aims to understand how these discourses have related to the global debate about women’s role in development. This study observes six discourses of women in developing countries in the material: Women as passive recipient, agent of empowerment, the savior, motherhood-women as mothers, the other woman, and the man as the norm. The analysis shows Sweden’s development policies following the global discussions fairly coherently during much of the period, with 80 s as the only possible exception. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} I focus on characterizing {{international}} system of a sub-region of the Baltic Sea {{area in the}} frames <b>of</b> environmental <b>cooperation.</b> I chose a case study that represents close collaboration and progressiveness. Environmental cooperation between Finland and Russia is rather intensive and it has developed well {{during the last few}} decades. Neighbourhood and good relations among the partners have promoted it as well. The Environmental City Twinning programme consists of sub-projects carried out by Finnish cities and St. Petersburg. Twinning between cities has been beneficial for the cooperation, indeed. Twinning means close collaboration, constant interaction, day-by-day working together and informal contacts. This increases openness in the cooperation and promotes equal partnership. I wanted to choose a possibly unique case for my study. Most likely, there is something in the city twinning programme that is worth of sharing with other <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> Finnish-Russian environmental <b>cooperation</b> and <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> on other fields as well. What are the lessons learned <b>of</b> city twinning <b>cooperation,</b> will be clarified in the results of the analysis. Theoretical approach of the English school gives me tools for characterizing the international arena of cooperating cities in Finland and North-West Russia. Those tools are the concepts of: international system, international society (pluralistic and solidarist) and world society. International society is a concept that is most often used by the English school researchers. According to Hedley Bull (one of the beginners of the theory), international society emerges when “a group of states, conscious of certain common interests and common values, forms a society {{in the sense that they}} conceive themselves to be bound by a common set of rules in their relations with one another, and share in the working of common institutions” (Dunne, Kurki and Smith 2007, 134). This thesis is about cooperation; hence, it is already a sign of an international society. In this study, the question is more about thickness or thinness of the society and about what elements of international regional society can be found in the society of cooperating cities. With the help of narrative analysis and the method of the model of actants created by A. J. Greimas, I was able to identify features of an international society within the frames of cooperating cities. The theoretical approach together with the method it was possible to describe the success <b>of</b> the environmental <b>cooperation</b> as well. The case study of environmental city twinning programme is an example <b>of</b> Finnish-Russian <b>cooperation.</b> However, it can be used somewhere else as well, where the similar circumstances can be found. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{object of}} this paper is to use Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) to study the effects <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> in {{business}} organizational settings. To model the functioning of a business organization we have used an Enterprise Engineering approach named Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). DEMO is based on the Ψ-theory which has the overall goal to extract the essence of an organization from its actual appearance. This theory assumes that an organization is a system <b>of</b> <b>actors</b> and incorporates four axioms. The operation axiom tells us that the implementation independent essence of an organization consists <b>of</b> <b>actor</b> roles and that the acts performed by the actor roles can be divided into two kinds: production acts and coordination acts. Another important axiom is the transaction axiom which states that coordination acts are performed as steps in universal patterns. Based on these assumptions and Game Theory principles <b>of</b> <b>cooperation,</b> a simple ABS was develop focused on studying the conditions that allow cooperation to emerge. By understanding these conditions, appropriate actions can be taken to foster the development <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> in such settings...|$|R
