5|$|On the August 17 {{episode of}} Raw, The Miz {{announced}} {{his intention to}} challenge for the United States Championship, and also debuted new ring attire and defeated Evan Bourne. He challenged for the United States Championship at the Night of Champions, Breaking Point and Hell in a Cell pay-per-views, but was unsuccessful. On the October 5 episode of Raw, the night after Hell in a Cell, The Miz received a rematch for the championship, and defeated Kofi Kingston to win the United States Championship and his first singles championship in WWE {{at the age of}} 28. The following pay-per-view event, Bragging Rights, was themed with interpromotional matches <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw he was booked against SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, his erstwhile tag team partner John Morrison. In the buildup to their first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of The Dirt Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable to the successful Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty. At Bragging Rights, Miz pinned Morrison to become {{the only member of the}} Raw roster to win an interpromotional match. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner surviving with Sheamus and Drew Mcintyre.|$|E

25|$|The Fallschirmjägers' {{greatest}} {{victory and}} greatest losses {{occurred during the}} Battle of Crete. Signals intelligence, {{in the form of}} Ultra, enabled the British to wait on each German drop zone, yet despite compromised secrecy, surviving German paratroops and airlanded mountain troops pushed the Commonwealth forces off the island in part by unexpected fire support from their light 75 mm guns, though seaborne reinforcements were destroyed by the Royal Navy. However, the losses were so great that Adolf Hitler forbade their use in such operations in the future. He felt that the main strength of the paratroopers was novelty, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British had clearly figured out how to defend against them, there was no real point to using them any more.|$|E

25|$|According to British reports, Lieutenant Faussett {{was unable}} to stop his boat in the rough tide water and it drifted {{too close to the}} General Armstrong. The Americans then opened fire with their long 9-pounders and scored hits on the pinnace. Two men were killed and seven others wounded before it was able to retire out of range. Carnation then {{immediately}} moved in and anchored in front of the American schooner to begin negotiations for a solution to the problem. When discussions failed <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> General Armstrong had fired the first shot in a neutral port, Carnation cut her cable and lowered four boats filled with heavily armed men and headed towards Captain Reid as he maneuvered his ship closer to shore. The first attack came at about 8:00 pm and when the American observed the incoming boats they maneuvered again to receive them. In the following skirmish, Carnation was kept out of range by enemy fire and the boats were repulsed with a loss estimated by Reid to be twenty dead and twenty wounded. One American was killed and another wounded.|$|E
500|$|Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha {{compared}} Olivia to {{the character}} Sydney Bristow from the television series Alias, and opined that Fringe [...] "continues to exhibit a satisfying stride." [...] Griffin however was disappointed that events from the previous episode were ignored, believing {{it to be a}} mistake to continue emphasising formulaic storytelling rather than a serialized format. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times felt that despite the extra ten minutes, [...] "Bound" [...] was [...] "more like a two-hour episode... being crammed into half the time". He thought the episode's four writers were [...] "all busy", as there were three stories going on at once, and compared Olivia to the similarly characterized Lost character Jack Shephard. Hanson concluded, [...] "But how bad can it be when my biggest complaint about a show is that I want more? <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cold winter of reruns has passed, we should be getting just that." ...|$|E
500|$|Vietnamese {{records show}} that when Định disobeyed the court's orders, he was {{stripped}} of his position and titles: [...] "Trương Định has refused {{to return to the}} exercise of his office, and he is accordingly removed from that function with loss of honorific titles." [...] Nguyen Thong, a former mandarin who fought alongside Định and corresponded with many other guerrilla leaders, agreed with the court records. According to Thong, Định's continued resistance resulted from local initiatives contrary to Huế's explicit instructions. Định's supporters implored him to disobey the edicts of 1862 that directed the partisans to end hostilities: [...] "Our people forced the Westerners to retreat many times, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court has made peace with them, they will surely kill us.... Since the court has settled with them, who will support us? Let us unite to strike back at them, to take for ourselves a piece of land on which we can fight for our lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|It has now {{disappeared}} from the Roman calendar, replaced on January 1 by the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, but is still celebrated by Old Catholics and some traditionalist Catholics. [...] It was for many centuries combined on January 1 with the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus, before the two were separated, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Feast of the Circumcision has disappeared as such from the official Catholic calendar, the other feast may be regarded as celebrating this too.|$|E
2500|$|However, to Kitchener and the British Command [...] "the life {{or death}} of the 154,000 Boer and African civilians in the camps rated as an abysmally low priority" [...] against {{military}} objectives. As the Fawcett Commission was delivering its recommendations, Kitchener wrote to St John Brodrick defending his policy of sweeps, and emphasising that no new Boer families were being brought in unless they {{were in danger of}} starving. This was disingenuous as the countryside had by then been devastated under the [...] "Scorched Earth" [...] policy (the Fawcett Commission in December 1901 in its recommendations commented that: [...] "to turn 100,000 people now being held in the concentration camps out on the veldt {{to take care of themselves}} would be cruelty") <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New Model counter insurgency tactics were in full swing, it made cynical military sense to leave the Boer families in desperate conditions in the countryside.|$|E
2500|$|In his postwar memoirs Harris wrote, [...] "In {{spite of}} all that {{happened}} at Hamburg, bombing proved a relatively humane method", which augmented his wartime views expressed in an internal secret memo to the Air Ministry after the Dresden raid in February 1945: [...] "I ... assume that the view under consideration is something like this: no doubt in the past we were justified in attacking German cities. But to do so was always repugnant <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans are beaten anyway we can properly abstain from proceeding with these attacks. This is a doctrine to which I could never subscribe. Attacks on cities like any other act of war are intolerable unless they are strategically justified. But they are strategically justified {{in so far as}} they tend to shorten the war and preserve the lives of Allied soldiers. To my mind we have absolutely no right to give them up unless it is certain that they will not have this effect. I do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier.|$|E

2500|$|Lacking the {{photogenic}} {{looks of}} many of his rock and roll contemporaries, Orbison eventually developed a persona that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, no presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. Life magazine called him an [...] "anonymous celebrity". After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963 while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had {{a good sense of humor}} and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume, then <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stationary performer was blind. The black clothes and desperation in his songs led to an aura of mystery and introversion. Years later Orbison said, [...] "I wasn't trying to be weird, you know? I didn't have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything. But the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although I never was, really." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{coalition}} that defeated Napoleon was financed by Britain, and held {{together at the}} Congress of Vienna in 1814–15. It successfully broke Napoleon's comeback attempt in 1815. [...] Castlereagh {{played a central role}} at Vienna, along with Austrian leader Klemens von Metternich. While many Europeans wanted to punish France heavily, Castlereagh insisted on a mild peace, with France to pay 700 million livre in indemnities and lose the territory seized after 1791. He realized that harsher terms would lead to a dangerous reaction in France, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conservative old-fashioned Bourbons were back in power, they were no longer a threat to attempt to conquer all of Europe. Indeed, Castlereagh emphasized the need for a [...] "balance of power", whereby no nation would be powerful enough to threaten the conquest of Europe the way Napoleon had. Vienna ushered in a century of peace, with no great wars and few important localized ones until the Crimean War (1853–56). Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur. Britain first took a Reactionary position at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, but relented and broke ranks with the absolute monarchies by 1820. [...] Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain's American colonies in 1824. British merchants and financiers, and later railway builders, played major roles in the economies of most Latin American nations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{release date}} for When Your Heart Stops Beating was heavily {{anticipated}} and publicized {{by the music}} press. As early as August 2005, Internet rumors began to circulate that the album would be released in January 2006 although the band's management denied the claims. Thanks to Hoppus and Barker's silence on press interviews, misinformation flooded the Internet in the {{months prior to the}} record's release, such as countless impostors posting fake songs online. [...] "It's kind of flattering that some kids would go out there and post songs under our name," [...] Barker added. [...] "I mean, at least it means that people are excited to hear our stuff." [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews before shortly prior to the release of the album, instead spending time updating his blog, producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack, and working on the album in relative secrecy. [...] "During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders," [...] reported James Montgomery of MTV News. While it [...] "pained" [...] them to do so, Hoppus and Barker refrained from speaking to media, instead burying themselves in the studio in the recording of the album. [...] "We just bit our tongues and didn't say anything, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> record is done, we get the chance to tell the truth about everything," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "We were silent for a year, and we couldn't put into words what we were doing, so we just decided not to say anything and let the music speak for itself," [...] Barker added. [...] "Now it's time for people to hear that music and hear the truth." ...|$|E
