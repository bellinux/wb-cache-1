40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{utilisation}} pattern of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency services and {{to study the}} possible impact of a user-fee policy on non-emergency attendances in Hong Kong. DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Four different scenarios are postulated to examine {{the impact on the}} number of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency attendances of a user-fee policy from 2000 to 2029. Patient volume data of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency attendances for 2000 were made available by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. RESULTS: Non-emergency use of the <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency services is the main cause of over-utilisation and contributes to more than 70. 0 % of its use. Only 22. 0 % of patients attending <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments were admitted to a ward for further treatment. By 2029, the number of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency attendances would increase by more than 47. 0 % if the present utilisation pattern prevails. However, if patients at triage levels 3, 4, and 5 were discouraged from using the <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency services, the number of attendances would decrease by 76. 4 %. CONCLUSION: The proposed user-fee policy would act as a deterrent by preventing unnecessary use of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency services. However, the use of out-patient services may be increased as a result and attendance should be carefully monitored. Community health education and civic education relating to abuse of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency services would be effective in reducing over-utilisation of these services. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} out of hours activity of general practice <b>and</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency services with deprivation <b>and</b> distance from <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department. DESIGN: Six month longitudinal study. SETTING: Six general practices <b>and</b> the sole <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department in Nottingham. SUBJECTS: 4745 out of hours contacts generated by 45, 182 patients from 23 electoral wards registered with six practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of out of hours contacts for general practice <b>and</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency services calculated by electoral ward; Jarman and Townsend deprivation scores <b>and</b> distance from <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department of electoral wards. RESULTS: Distances of wards from <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department ranged from 0. 8 to 9 km, and Jarman deprivation scores ranged from - 23. 4 to 51. 8. Out of hours contacts varied by ward from 110 to 350 events/ 1000 patients/year, and 58 % of this variation was explained by the Jarman score. General practice <b>and</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency rates were positively correlated (Pearson coefficient 0. 50, P = 0. 015). Proximity to <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department was not significantly associated with increased activity when deprivation was included in regression analysis. One practice had substantially higher out of hours activity (B coefficient 124 (95 % confidence interval 67 to 181)) even when deprivation was included in regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A disproportionate amount of out of hours workload fell on deprived inner city practices. High general practice <b>and</b> high <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency activity occurred in the same areas rather than one service substituting for the other...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the distribution and}} scope of nurse practitioner schemes in <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments in England and Wales; to describe the caseloads of doctors and nurse practitioners on two representative days; and to estimate {{the number of patients}} managed by nurse practitioners in the year to 31 March 1991. DESIGN [...] A postal survey of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments and a content analysis of case notes of new patients attending a representative sample of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments on two days. SETTING [...] All <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS [...] Survey: 560 nurses in charge of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments. Census: case notes of 5814 patients in 37 <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Survey: number of <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments with nurse practitioner schemes. Census: demographic and clinical characteristics of new patients attending and whether nurse practitioner or doctor made diagnoses and ordered investigations, treatments, referrals, discharges. RESULTS [...] 513 replies (92 %) from 465 surveyed functioning <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments and 48 departments recently closed. 27 (6 %) departments used designated nurse practitioners and 159 (34 %) "unofficial" nurse practitioners. Only 530 (9 %) of the 5814 patients in the census were managed entirely or mainly by nurse practitioners, with higher proportions in ophthalmic departments (nearly 30 %) and minor casualty departments (over 40 %) than in major departments (3 %). Most patients managed by nurse practitioners (86 %) had minor trauma. In the year ending 31 March 1991 an estimated 390, 000 (95 % confidence interval 260, 000 to 520, 000) patients {{out of a total of}} 12. 5 million (3. 1 %, 2. 1 % to 4. 1 %) were clinically managed by a nurse practitioner. CONCLUSIONS [...] Designated nurse practitioner schemes are rare. The volume and range of nurse practitioner work in major general <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments is small compared with those in specialised <b>and</b> minor <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{has shown}} that the amount of people being {{admitted}} to <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments is increasing every year. This number is set to increase further as the ageing population is also set to increase. The focus of health care within the National Health Service is changing with a higher emphasis on reducing unnecessary admissions to hospital and keeping length of admission to a minimum. Occupational therapists have been identified as the ideal health professionals to work within an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency setting, however the government states that it will only continue to fund services that are evidence based. There is very little published evidence to support the benefits that occupational therapy input has within an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency setting. This paper aims to investigate the benefits that occupational therapy input has within an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency setting. A literature review will be completed highlighting the importance of evidence-based practice to identify the role that occupational therapists have within an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency setting. It will also review the evidence that is available to highlight the benefits of occupational therapy input within an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency setting. A quantitative study will be proposed to investigate if occupational therapy input helps to reduce readmissions to hospital of people over the age of 65, within twenty-eight days of them being discharged from an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department, who require occupational therapy input...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether {{improvement in the}} care of victims of major trauma could be made by using the revised trauma score as a triage tool to help junior <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency doctors rapidly identify seriously injured patients and thereby call a senior <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency specialist to supervise their resuscitation. DESIGN [...] Comparison of results of audit of management of all seriously injured patients before and after these measures were introduced. SETTING [...] <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department in an urban hospital. PATIENTS [...] All seriously injured patients (injury severity score greater than 15) admitted to the department six months before and one year after introduction of the measures. RESULTS [...] Management errors were reduced from 58 % (21 / 36) to 30 % (16 / 54) (p less than 0. 01). Correct treatment rather than improvement in diagnosis or investigation accounted for almost all the improvement. CONCLUSIONS [...] The management of seriously injured patients in the <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department can be improved by introducing two simple measures: using the revised trauma score as a triage tool to help junior doctors in the <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency department rapidly identify seriously injured patients, and calling a senior <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency specialist to supervise the resuscitation of all seriously injured patients. IMPLICATIONS [...] Care of patients in <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency departments can be improved considerably at no additional expense by introducing two simple measures...|$|R
