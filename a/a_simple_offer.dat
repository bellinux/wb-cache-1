Early Mongol diplomacy had been not <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>offer</b> of cooperation, but straightforward demands for submission.

His recommendation was that even if working together, European armies and Mongol armies should avoid contact because of Mongol arrogance. European leaders were aware that the Mongols would not have been content to stop at the Holy Land, but were on a clear quest for world domination. If the Mongols had achieved a successful alliance with the West and destroyed the Mamluk Sultanate, they certainly would have eventually turned upon the Franks of Cyprus and the Byzantines.

40|$|Computationally {{expensive}} simulations play {{an increasing}} role in engineering design, but {{their use in}} multi-objective optimization is heavily resource constrained. Specialist optimizers, such as ParEGO, exist for this setting, but little knowledge is available to guide their configuration. This paper uses a new implementation of ParEGO to examine three hypotheses relating to a key configuration parameter: choice of scalarising norm. Two hypotheses consider the theoretical trade-off between convergence speed and ability to capture an arbitrary Pareto front geometry. Experiments confirm these hypotheses in the bi-objective setting but the trade-off is largely unseen in many-objective settings. A third hypothesis considers the ability of dynamic norm scheduling schemes to overcome the trade-off. Experiments using <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> scheme <b>offer</b> partial support to the hypothesis in the bi-objective setting but no support in many-objective contexts. Norm scheduling is tentatively recommended for bi-objective problems for which the Pareto front geometry is concave or unknown...|$|R
