25|$|Traditionally, all Tanala men {{and women}} {{regardless}} of social class wore clothing made from woven or beaten mats made from harefo reeds (Eleocharis plantagines).

The body was tightly corseted, with a low, broad neckline and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the overskirt was drawn back and pinned up to display the petticoat, which was heavily decorated.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Muralitharan voluntarily {{performed}} {{a series of}} tests with live video cameras. Michael Slater and Ravi Shastri witnessed it all unfold. Muralitharan once again showed he could bowl all his deliveries including the doosra with an arm brace that prevents any straightening of his elbow. Orthopediatrician Dr Mandeep Dillon stated that Muralitharan's unusual ability to generate extra movement both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> as well the wrist enables him to bowl the doosra without straightening the elbow.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{patients}} after the Battle of Borodino in 1812 was an infantry officer whose arm had to be amputated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The patient was evacuated immediately following the operation and passed from Russia, through Poland and Germany. On his arrival {{at his home in}} France the dressing was removed and the wound found to be healed. Larrey concluded that the fact that the wound had been undisturbed had facilitated healing. After the war, Larrey began stiffening bandages using camphorated alcohol, lead acetate and egg whites beaten in water.|$|E
25|$|Medical history (the patient {{tells the}} doctor about an injury).

Other salutary information includes OPQRST (onset, palliation/provocation, quality, radiation, severity, timing) and a history of issues that could lead to referred pain (pain felt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> but actually coming from another part of the body) including cervical spine disorders, heart attacks, peptic ulcer disease, and pneumonia.|$|E

50|$|The giant tapir (Tapirus augustus) is an extinct tapir {{that lived}} in {{southern}} China, reports also suggest it also lived in Java and Vietnam. It appeared soon after the Early Pleistocene and perhaps survived up until the early Holocene. It was larger than modern tapirs, estimations range from 2.1 m long and 0.9 m tall <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> to 3.5 m long, and 1.5 m metres tall <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b> It may have weighed up to 500 kg.

25|$|Bison are {{the largest}} grazing mammals in Yellowstone National Park. They are obligate herbivores, a grazer of grasslands and sedges in the meadows, the foothills, and even the high-elevation, forested {{plateaus}} of Yellowstone. Bison males, called bulls, can weigh upwards of 1,800 pounds. Females (cows) average about 1,300 pounds. Both stand approximately six feet tall <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and can move with surprising speed to defend their young or when approached too closely by people. Bison breed from mid-July to mid-August, and bear one calf in April and May. Some wolf predation of bison is documented in Canada and has recently been observed in Yellowstone. Bison live an average lifespan of 20–25 years in the wild.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{clothing}} {{among the}} Antaifasy {{was made of}} bark cloth or woven mats of beaten reeds or sedges sewn together. The bark cloth from the Antaifasy region was made from a mix of fibers blended together for sheen and softness and became a specialty trade product of the area. For women, this material was sewn to form a tube that was belted at the waist or pulled up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Women and adolescent girls also often wore a mahampy reed band or short top with or without sleeves, to cover the breasts. Men wore a bark loincloth, and over it they would typically wear a vest or tunic; sleeves were added for older men. Woven hats were also commonly worn by Antaifasy men.|$|E
25|$|The bell {{itself is}} simple in design, {{hammered}} into shape {{with a small}} handle fixed to the top with rivets. Originally forged from iron, it has since been coated in bronze. The shrine is inscribed with three names, including King Domnall Ua Lochlainn's. The rear of the shrine, {{not intended to be}} seen, is decorated with crosses while the handle is decorated with, among other work, Celtic designs of birds. The bell is accredited with working a miracle in 1044 and having been coated in bronze to shield it from human eyes, for which it would be too holy. It measures 12.510cm at the base, 12.84cm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> 16.5cm from base to shoulder, 3.3cm from shoulder to top of handle and weighs 1.7kg.|$|E
