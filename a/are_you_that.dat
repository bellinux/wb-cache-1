500|$|Canning's honesty (or lack of it) and Fielding's {{handling}} of the case were raised in a deeply critical attack printed by The London Daily Advertiser. [...] On {{the same day that}} Gascoyne ordered Canning's arrest an advertisement appeared in the Public Advertiser, asking its readers [...] "to suspend their judgement in the Case of the Gypsy Woman till a full State of the whole, which is now being prepared by Mr. Fielding, is published." [...] Fielding had learnt of Hall's questioning by Gascoyne and had brought Canning to his house in Bow Street, to [...] "sift the truth out of her, and to bring her to confession if she was guilty." [...] Satisfied with her account, and unconcerned with Hall, his critique of Squires' supporters was published as A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning, in which he espoused the virtuous nature of the young maid and attacked those her detractors. [...] Copies sold so quickly that a second print run was ordered two days later. [...] John Hill saw A Clear Statement as a direct attack on Gascoyne, and blasted Fielding with The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered, which ridiculed his enemy with such comments as: [...] "Who Sir, <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> are thus dictating unto the Government? [...] Retire into yourself and know your station." [...] Fielding, however, played little part in the saga from thereon, believing that Canning's supporters had begun to see him as an obstacle to their case.|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Li Kuo (as Emperor Dezong). [...] Li Kui {{continued}} to serve as minister of rites, but the powerful chancellor Lu Qi was jealous of his reputation and seniority. [...] In 783, after the emissary of the Tibetan Empire Qujiazan (區頰贊) arrived in Chang'an to negotiate a border realignment treaty with Tang and after the treaty was completed, at Lu's instigation, Emperor Dezong made Li Kui emissary to the Tibetan Empire to escort Qujiazan back to the Tibetan Empire. [...] Li Kui, then 72, stated to Emperor Dezong, [...] "I do not fear going that far a distance, but I am afraid that I would die on the way and not complete my task." [...] Emperor Dezong, who was saddened by the remarks, told Lu, [...] "Li Kui is too old." [...] Lu responded, [...] "An emissary to a far-away foreign state {{needs to have a}} good reputation. [...] Further, if Li Kui, who is this old, is sent as an emissary, then in the future, no official younger than Li Kui would dare to refuse such a task." [...] When Li Kui got to the Tibetan Empire, its king Trisong Detsen asked, [...] "I heard that there is a Li Kui who is the most able of officials in Tang. [...] <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> person, lord?" [...] Li Kui was afraid that this meant that Trisong Detsen intended to detain him, and therefore responded, [...] "That Li Kui would never be willing to come here." [...] On his way of returning from the Tibetan Empire in 784, he died at Feng Prefecture (鳳州, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). [...] He was buried with honor and given the posthumous name Gong (恭, meaning [...] "respectful").|$|E
