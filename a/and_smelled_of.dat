500|$|In studies {{carried out}} prior to 1991–92 on {{physical}} and chemical parameters of the lake water, Lake Untersee was stated to be well-mixed and unstratified. However, studies performed {{in the summer of}} 1991–92 found significant stratification in a [...] wide trough in the southeastern part of the lake, where it is up to [...] deep. There were sharp vertical gradients of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity. While a thermocline was recorded at a depth between [...] and , an oxycline followed at , with a chemocline extending from [...] to bottom of the lake. Below , the water column was anoxic <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen sulfide. The presence of hydrogen sulfide was associated with decreased sulfate concentrations, indicating that it probably arose from bacterial reduction of sulfate.|$|E
2500|$|Knorr was physically, verbally, {{and psychologically}} abusive towards her children. After her fourth divorce, her {{alcoholism}} and abusive behavior escalated, {{and she also}} gained {{a tremendous amount of}} weight and became quick-tempered and reclusive. She disconnected the home phone and would not allow the children to have visitors. [...] Knorr and her children lived in Orangevale, California for many years before moving into a two-bedroom apartment in Sacramento; Knorr's eldest son Howard reportedly left home before the move to Sacramento. According to neighbors, the apartment was filthy <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> urine. Neighbors also noticed that the children, whom Knorr never let go outside, seemed fearful, nervous and high-strung.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Ethan tugged the {{two cases}} up and set them {{down on the floor}} of the kitchen. Mrs. Ripley opened a bottle <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> it like a {{cautious}} cat.|$|E

60|$|So {{once more}} he {{scrambled}} {{down from the}} pile of corn and little by little drew nearer to the two queer things. The nearer he got, the more harmless they looked. Finally he reached out <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> the smallest. Then he turned up his nose.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to go}} hunting!" [...] mourned Carl, as he trailed {{back into}} the woodshed. It seemed darker than ever <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> moldy chips. He bounced like an enraged chipmunk. His phlegmatic china-blue eyes filmed with tears. [...] "Won't pile no more wood!" [...] he declared.|$|E
60|$|Here, {{away from}} the world, the villages were quiet and obscure--left behind. They had the same {{fascinating}} atmosphere of being forgotten, {{left out of the}} world, that old English villages have. And buying apples and cheese and bread in a little shop that sold everything <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> everything, I felt at home again.|$|E

60|$|She {{spoke of}} them warmly. Then, {{suddenly}} afraid, she drifted off again. I ate the omelette with cognac, {{which was very}} good, then I looked in the street. It was very dark, with bright stars, <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> snow. Two village men went by. I was tired, I {{did not want to}} go to the inn.|$|E
60|$|She {{helped them}} to move Adolph into the kitchen. The man {{was in such a}} funk that he would not use his legs. He was heavy, <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> sweat and the stable. But she put her arm about his waist, her sleek head by his chest; she tugged at him; she clicked her tongue in {{imitation}} of Kennicott's cheerful noises.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} the dinner bell rang they were feeling at home in their new quarters. At the table they met the other boarders: the Brann brothers, newsdealers; old man Troutt, who kept the livery stable (<b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> it); and a small, dark, and wizened woman who kept the {{millinery}} store. The others, who came in late, were clerks.|$|E
50|$|The taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> Psilocybe caerulescens are {{strongly}} farinaceous, reminiscent of cucumber, though the smell lessens with age or when dry.|$|R

But as he ran he dropped a little round ball on the ice. And the bear stopped <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> it, and then swallowed it up. And Keesh continued to run away and drop little round balls, and the bear continued to swallow them up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God's country!" [...] he said, as {{he struck}} the first low swell of rising land, where a cool wind from off the wooded and watered hills greeted his face. Dust there still was, {{but it seemed}} a {{different}} kind <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> apple-orchards and alfalfa-fields. Here were hard, smooth roads, and Anderson sped his car miles and miles through a country that was a verdant fragrant bower, and across bright, shady streams and by white little hamlets.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{stepped closer}} {{and leaned over}} to examine it--it was the dead body of a naked warrior from whose chest {{protruded}} a short spear. Then he searched carefully every square foot of the remaining floor space and at last returned to the body again where he stooped <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> the haft of the weapon that had slain the black. A slow smile touched his lips--that and a slight movement of his head betokened that he understood.|$|E

60|$|At {{the base}} this vent was dark, cool, <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> dry, musty dust. It zigzagged {{so that he}} could not see ahead more than a few yards at a time. He noticed tracks of wildcats and rabbits in the dusty floor. At every turn he {{expected}} to come upon a huge cavern full of little square stone houses, each with a small aperture like a staring dark eye. The passage lightened and widened, and opened {{at the foot of a}} narrow, steep, ascending chute.|$|E
60|$|George Pendyce, in a fly {{drawn by}} an old grey horse, the only vehicle that frequented the station at Worsted Skeynes, passed him in the lane, and leaned back to avoid observation. He had not {{forgotten}} {{the tone of the}} Rector's voice in the smoking-room {{on the night of the}} dance. George was a man who could remember as well as another. In the corner of the old fly, that rattled <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> stables and stale tobacco, he fixed his moody eyes on the driver's back and the ears of the old grey horse, and never stirred till they set him down at the hall door.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} a settled if very modest income was at once {{apparent}} to him remembering the threadbare refinement in that tiny flat eight {{years ago when he}} announced her good fortune. Everything was now fresh, dainty, <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> flowers. The general effect was silvery with touches of black, hydrangea colour, and gold. 'A woman of great taste,' he thought. Time had dealt gently with Jolyon, for he was a Forsyte. But with Irene Time hardly seemed to deal at all, or such was his impression. She appeared to him not a day older, standing there in mole-coloured velvet corduroy, with soft dark eyes and dark gold hair, with outstretched hand and a little smile.|$|E

60|$|Alas, we {{were not}} to be alone: two young Neapolitans, pleasant, quiet, blond, or semi-blond. They were well-bred, and evidently of {{northern}} extraction. Afterwards we found out they were jewellers. But I liked their quiet, gentle manners. The dinner began, and we were through the soup, when up pranced another young fellow, rather strapping and loud, a commercial traveller, for sure. He had those cocky assured manners of one who is not sure of his manners. He had a rather high forehead, and black hair brushed up in a showy wing, and a large ring on his finger. Not that a ring signifies anything. Here most of the men wear several, all massively jewelled. If one believed in all the jewels, why Italy would be more fabulous than fabled India. But our friend the bounder was smart, <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> cash. Not money, but cash.|$|E
60|$|When {{her father}} slept indoors, which was seldom except in winter, he {{occupied}} {{a couch in}} the opposite corner. A rude cupboard had been built against the logs next to the fireplace. It contained supplies and utensils. Toward the center, somewhat closer to the door, stood a crude table and two benches. The cabin was dark <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> smoke, of the stale odors of past cooked meals, of the mustiness of dry, rotting timber. Streaks of light showed through the roof where the rough-hewn shingles had split or weathered. A strip of bacon hung upon {{one side of the}} cupboard, and upon the other a haunch of venison. Ellen detested the Mexican woman because she was dirty. The inside of the cabin presented the same unkempt appearance usual to it after Ellen had been away for a few days. Whatever Ellen had lost during the retrogression of the Jorths, she had kept her habits of cleanliness, and straightway upon her return she set to work.|$|E
60|$|The {{world of}} sky and cloud and earthly abyss seemed one of storm-sundered grandeur. The air was sultry and still, <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> the {{peculiar}} burnt-wood odor caused by lightning striking trees. A few heavy drops of rain were pattering {{down from the}} thin, gray edge of clouds overhead. To the east hung the storm--a black cloud lodged against the Rim, from which long, misty veils of rain streamed down into the gulf. The roar of rain sounded like the steady roar of the rapids of a river. Then a blue-white, piercingly bright, ragged streak of lightning shot {{down out of the}} black cloud. It struck with a splitting report that shocked the very wall of rock under Ellen. Then the heavens seemed to burst open with thundering crash and close with mighty thundering boom. Long roar and longer rumble rolled away to the eastward. The rain poured down in roaring cataracts.|$|E
