5|$|A {{series of}} battles {{followed}} at Uijeongbu on 1–4 January 1951, as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions {{in an attempt}} to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital. Further fighting occurred at Chuam-ni on 14–17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance, and later at Maehwa-San between 7–12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive.
