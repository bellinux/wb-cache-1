40|$|In this study, {{we have a}} {{analysis}} of the <b>ARM</b> <b>core</b> unit design of a remote video monitoring system.

An <b>ARM</b> <b>core</b> unit is designed based on ARM architecture and ARM chips. It includes hardware and software design. Practice shows high stability and reliability of the design...|$|R

25|$|<b>ARM</b> <b>cores</b> {{are used}} {{in a number of}} products, {{particularly}} PDAs and smartphones. Some computing examples are Microsoft's first generation Surface and Surface 2, Apple's iPads, Asus's Eee Pad Transformer tablet computers, and several Chromebook laptops.

25|$|Systems, {{including}} iPhone smartphones, frequently {{include many}} chips, {{from many different}} providers, that include one or more licensed <b>Arm</b> <b>cores,</b> {{in addition to those}} in the main Arm-based processor. Arm's core designs are also used in chips that support many common network related technologies in smartphones: Bluetooth, WiFi and broadband, in addition to corresponding equipment such as Bluetooth headsets, 802.11ac routers, and network provider's cellular LTE.|$|E

25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing <b>ARM</b> <b>cores,</b> they generally hold the right to re-manufacture <b>ARM</b> <b>cores</b> for other customers.|$|E
25|$|ARM Holdings prices its IP {{based on}} {{perceived}} value. Lower performing <b>ARM</b> <b>cores</b> typically have lower licence costs than higher performing cores. In implementation terms, a synthesizable core {{costs more than}} a hard macro (blackbox) core. Complicating price matters, a merchant foundry that holds an ARM licence, such as Samsung or Fujitsu, can offer fab customers reduced licensing costs. In exchange for acquiring the ARM core through the foundry's in-house design services, the customer can reduce or eliminate payment of ARM's upfront licence fee.|$|E
25|$|Apple did {{not develop}} the iPod {{software}} entirely in-house, instead using PortalPlayer's reference platform {{based on two}} <b>ARM</b> <b>cores.</b> The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans—a font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. Color display iPods then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again {{with the introduction of}} the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item).|$|E
