40|$|Background: Seminiferous tubules {{comprise}} 80 - 90 % of testicular mass. Thus, the testicular {{volume is}} believed to be an index of spermatogenesis. Therefore, accurate testicular volume is one way to assess testicular function. Objective: To determine the accuracy of Prader orchidometer for measuring the testicular volume by comparing the resultant measurement with the <b>actual</b> testicular <b>volume</b> in humans. Materials and Methods: The testicular volumes of 121 testes from 62 patients with prostate cancer (mean age 72. 74 ±  9. 38 years) were measured using Prader orchidometer before therapeutic bilateral orchidectomy. The <b>actual</b> testicular <b>volumes</b> were then determined by water displacement of the testis. Results: The mean testicular volume of the 121 testes was 10. 60   ±  3. 5 ml and 13. 26   ±  5. 2 ml for water displacement and Prader orchidometer measurements, respectively. A strong correlation was found between the <b>actual</b> testicular <b>volume</b> and volumes obtained by Prader orchidometer (r  =  0. 926, P  =  0. 0001). The Prader orchidometer however, over-estimated the mean <b>actual</b> testicular <b>volume</b> by 2. 66   ±  2. 37 ml (25. 10 %). Conclusion: The result of this study has shown that measuring the testicular volume by Prader orchidometer overestimates the <b>actual</b> testicular <b>volume...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} during {{spring and summer}} 2012 together with the company Uppsala Academy of Management as the principal. The two main objectives for the work are that: • Make a comparison between the measured volume in the standing forest and the measured volume at the industry on Uppsala Academy of Managements <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> {{to see how well}} it conforms. • Examine if the buyers see any particular advantages or disadvantages of <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> and what they think of Uppsala Academy of Managements <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> and structure in general. I chose to use <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> from the tree years 2009, 2010 and 2011 in my work. I divided the <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> following four categories which was pine, spruce, pine/spruce and seed trees. After that I picked out sixteen <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volumes</b> from each category {{to be a part of}} the work. When I selected the <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> to be included in the work I contacted the buyers to get access to the measured volume. To make the study of the buyers opinion about Uppsala Academy of Managements <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> and structure in general I sent out eight questions that I together with Uppsala Academy of Management decided. This work shows that the measured volume at the standing forest and the measured volume at the industry align very well with only a difference of 616 m 3 solid wood under bark or 0. 6 percent The responses received from the buyers to the questions I sent out can shortly be summarized with that the advantages of the <b>actual</b> stumpage sale <b>volume</b> is that they are fully planned and ready to be harvested.

50|$|Because it is {{difficult}} to measure <b>actual</b> <b>volume</b> and easy to measure mass, many of these units are now also defined as units of mass, specific to each commodity, so a bushel of apples is a different weight from a bushel of wheat (weighed at a specific moisture level).
