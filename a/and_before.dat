40|$|Percutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is an invasive diagnostic {{investigation that}} may result in high level of anxiety and “fear of the unknown” among cardiac patients. An increment in anxiety among PCI patients will augment the level of stress and this extreme stress level will then aggravate depression. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the incidence of anxiety <b>and</b> depression <b>before</b> <b>and</b> after PCI. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used. It measured two elements, namely, the anxiety and depression levels of patients <b>before</b> <b>and</b> after PCI. This study was conducted in the cardiology wards Anggerik and Dahlia, and Day Care of the National Heart Institute, from January to February 2006. A sample of 61 patients <b>before</b> <b>and</b> after PCI who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited in this study. Of these, 40 <b>and</b> 38 patients <b>before</b> <b>and</b> after PCI respectively, had low anxiety levels; while, 47 <b>and</b> 46 patients <b>before</b> <b>and</b> after PCI respectively, had low depression levels. Anxiety <b>and</b> depression levels <b>before</b> <b>and</b> after PCI were not significantly correlated to socio demographic status. However, a significant correlation (p< 0. 05) was found between anxiety <b>and</b> depression levels <b>before</b> <b>and</b> after PCI.
