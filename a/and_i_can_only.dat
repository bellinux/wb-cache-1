5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E

Here companies have been playing a game, using the media and publishing to make themselves look good. We only hope that the foreign media will soon begin to understand what has been going on.” ...|$|E
500|$|Colin Jacobson {{from the}} DVD Movie Guide website complained about {{its lack of}} {{sharpness}} and commented, [...] "Frankly, I'm {{at a loss to}} understand how such an unattractive video hit the shelves". He also criticized the lack of extra content, but complimented the DVD's sound. Jacobson gave the release's image, sound and extras ratings of D+, A-, D, respectively. Aaron Beriele from DVD Talk website shared Jacobson's views, saying that it was [...] "a wonderful show from Madonna <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> imagine {{what it was like to}} actually be there. As for the DVD, it offers outstanding audio quality, but only so-so image quality. Still, it's a terrific show and the DVD still certainly gets a recommendation." ...|$|E

500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What I want to do is get a certain attitude in the voice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to get through this fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E
500|$|Having been {{released}} by Stevenage {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011. He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County. On joining Gateshead, Odubade said [...] "I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is now a new chapter for me. Gateshead is a good club that is moving in the right direction and I'm sure we can kick on next season. I don't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason. I am always looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge for me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards. His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two-foot injuries midway through the campaign, with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions, subsequently missing a total of 18 games. Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E
500|$|Hearsay and {{conjecture}} have clouded {{assessment of}} the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was {{anything other than a}} victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, [...] "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position {{to spend the rest of}} his life with her." [...] Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that [...] "left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [...] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her 'insatiable ambitions'... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, 'You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> create disaster together'... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax, 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other... She had thought of him as emotionally a Peter Pan, and of herself an Alice in Wonderland. The book they had written together, however, was a Paradise Lost." [...] The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: [...] "You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{off down}} the river, Watson," [...] said he. [...] "I have been turning it over in my mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see <b>only</b> one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{dare you}} suggest such a thing?--but--but as Grumps has gone, {{and there is}} no new Grumps to refer to, <b>and</b> {{therefore}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> consult my own wishes, perhaps if you really wish to, Philip, why, Philip, you may." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right, I'll {{wait for}} you, and love {{you all the}} better for the sacrifice," [...] whispered Belle. [...] "I only wish I could share your hardships, dear, for while you fight <b>and</b> suffer <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> love <b>and</b> pray." ...|$|R
2500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} the club had been relegated, Defoe made a written request for a transfer, saying, [...] "As much as I love West Ham United I feel that now is {{the right time for}} me to move on in my career. This is very much a career decision. I am very ambitious and hungry to achieve {{at the highest levels of}} the game for both club and country." [...] The timing of his request, however, drew {{criticism}} from both fans and teammates and was turned down by the club. He later apologised to supporters, saying, [...] "I mishandled that move <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> apologise. I'm young and I've learned from it. I still played my hardest for West Ham and gave them 100% and want to thank the fans for their support." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colin Meloy of the Decemberists, who {{recorded}} a 2005 EP of Morrissey covers titled Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey, acknowledged Morrissey's influence on his songwriting: [...] "You could either bask in that glow of fatalistic narcissism, {{or you could}} think it was funny. I always thought that was an interesting dynamic in his songwriting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> aspire {{to have that kind}} of dynamic in my songs". Brandon Flowers of the American rock band The Killers has revealed his admiration for Morrissey on several occasions and admits that his interest for writing songs about murder such as [...] "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine" [...] and [...] "Midnight Show" [...] traces back to Morrissey singing about loving [...] "the romance of crime" [...] in the song [...] "Sister I'm a Poet". Flowers was quoted as saying, [...] "I studied that line a lot. And it's kind of embedded in me". Noel Gallagher called Morrissey [...] "the best lyricist I've ever heard".|$|E

60|$|I am {{very happy}} to know that my course has not {{conflicted}} with your judgment of propriety <b>and</b> policy <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> say that <b>I</b> have acted upon my best convictions, without selfishness or malice, and that by the help of God I shall continue to do so.|$|R
60|$|On an {{occasion}} like this the proprieties require that you merely pay compliments {{to the guest}} of the occasion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am merely here to pay compliments to the guest of the occasion, not to criticise him in any way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say <b>only</b> complimentary things to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Unlike Mr. Lomas, I {{thoroughly}} enjoy a dance,' he said, {{turning to}} Lady Kelsey. 'My tastes are ingenuous, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> hope you've enjoyed your evening {{as much as}} your guests.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Cavanagh showed himself. [...] "I hear so much {{laughter}} I'm coming in, we're all so insufferably political out here. And, besides, I {{came to see}} the ladies, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> stay a {{few minutes}} longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Northmoor, it {{was very}} horrid and {{unguarded}} in me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be sorry and beg your pardon,' and while she laughed and held out her hand, there was a dew in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|He knew, however, that {{it would}} do no good to cry, and so, after a time, he dried his eyes, and went in. He could not help hoping that his father would not count the Sunday; <b>and</b> “If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> have Monday,” said he to himself, “it will all be well.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to hunt up this Holtzmann, {{and find}} out what he knows about my father's affairs.

6000|$|... "To {{think of}} it!" [...] softly sobbed Mrs. Cliff, {{after she had}} {{carefully}} closed her bedroom door. [...] "With this <b>and</b> what <b>I</b> am to get, I believe I could buy the bank, <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> sit here <b>and</b> {{try to think of}} some place to hide this dangerous piece of paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{insensibility}} to {{this terrible}} tragedy," [...] he explained. [...] "My nerves have been shattered, Mr. Policeman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> repair the mischief in this way. Be pleased to excuse and feel for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Dad." [...] She {{raised her}} head from his {{shoulder}} and, clasping her hands round her knees, looked straight before her. [...] "We can only help ourselves; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> bear it if I rebel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} {{sensible}} of my ill-breeding, Miss Vernon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> say for myself that I had received some communications by which my spirits were unusually agitated. I am conscious I was impertinent and absurd." ...|$|E

60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Certainly not, madam. I am {{fortunately}} in {{no danger}} of contracting it.

6000|$|... "Armine {{has lost}} his very best and dearest friend," [...] she said, {{pressing}} her hands together. [...] "Oh yes, go to him! Armie <b>can</b> feel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> choke!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks to {{the great}} {{kindness}} of my hosts," [...] Louise replied, smiling a little mockingly at Stephen, [...] "I have been completely spoiled here, prince, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> regard my accident as a delightful little interlude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{you were}} good. You {{need not have}} come unless you had wished it. I had so spoken to you as to justify you in staying away. My voice is gone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> squeak at you in this broken treble." ...|$|E
60|$|Of Harold's doings in Australia I {{can tell}} less than {{of those at}} home. He kept his promise, dear fellow, and wrote regularly. But, alas! his letters are all gone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> speak from memory of them, and from what Dermot told me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{decide on}} his {{imperfections}} {{so much in}} the mass," [...] replied Elinor, [...] "and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold <b>and</b> insipid. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed, of gentle address, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> believe, possessing an amiable heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Barker, I {{thank you}} for what you said to me last night.

40|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> {{outline the}} main {{approach}} to this theme in the brief space available.
