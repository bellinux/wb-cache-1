5|$|The first gardens on the Cummer {{property}} {{were designed}} by Ossian Cole Simonds in 1903, just after the adjoining house was completed.

Sections of Clara and Waldo's garden {{were designed by}} William Lyman Phillips, a partner in the Olmstead Brothers firm. The Olmsted Brothers also advised Ninah on a design for a wall garden in 1922, but she chose to plant a garden designed by William Mercer of Philadelphia. The Cummer Gardens were selected for the National Register of Historic Places because they represent the history of <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> design in the first four decades of the twentieth century.|$|E

An early proponent of drought tolerant and California native plants in garden design, Sessions established a nursery to propagate and grow for the park and the public.|$|E
25|$|William Gear – {{a student}} of Fernand Léger and the only British member of the avant-garde CoBrA {{movement}} – had close links with Birmingham, exhibiting with the Birmingham Artists Committee and forming links with the Birmingham Surrealists in the 1940s, before finally moving {{to the city to}} teach at the School of Art in 1964. Later that decade John Salt's obsessively detailed paintings of cars and mobile homes in the <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> made him the only major English artist among the pioneers of photorealism.|$|E

25|$|The Hudson River School, {{one of the}} {{critical}} movements in nineteenth-century <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> painting, is an important focus of the ACMAA collection. Two major oils by Thomas Cole (1801–1848) and one by Cole’s protégé Frederic Edwin Church (1826–1900) anchor the museum’s holdings of signature Hudson River School paintings. The Narrows from Staten Island (1866–68), a panoramic depiction of Staten Island and New York Harbor by Jasper Francis Cropsey (1823–1900), is a notable example of the Hudson River School‘s preoccupation with scenery along the Hudson River Valley and surrounding area (see picture gallery below).|$|E
25|$|The Capitol Grounds cover {{approximately}} 274 acres (1.11km²), {{with the}} grounds proper consisting mostly of lawns, walkways, streets, drives, and planting areas. Several monumental sculptures {{used to be}} located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including The Rescue and George Washington. The current grounds were designed by noted <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from 1874 to 1892. In 1875, {{as one of his}} first recommendations, Olmsted proposed the construction of the marble terraces on the north, west, and south sides of the building that exist today.|$|E
25|$|We had {{transparent}} isolation booths onstage {{in which}} each of them--there were four people all together--you know, Herb Caen, Allen Ginsberg, et cetera, et cetera--we were able to broadcast and switch the signals from the various booths onto a series of speakers. In the meantime, we were projecting a series of slides which came from the Verbal <b>American</b> <b>Landscape.</b> Those had been chosen by me--I didn't do the photography; Ivan and Stewart Brand did the photography. We borrowed some closed-circuit television equipment, so there were television images. We were able to switch the whole thing. There were people in costume--it was a very elaborate affair.|$|E

25|$|This Wisconsin {{glaciation}} left widespread {{impacts on}} the North <b>American</b> <b>landscape.</b> The Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes were carved by ice deepening old valleys. Most of the lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were gouged out by glaciers and later filled with glacial meltwaters. The old Teays River drainage system was radically altered and largely reshaped into the Ohio River drainage system. Other rivers were dammed and diverted to new channels, such as Niagara Falls, which formed a dramatic waterfall and gorge, when the waterflow encountered a limestone escarpment. Another similar waterfall, at the present Clark Reservation State Park near Syracuse, New York, is now dry.|$|E
