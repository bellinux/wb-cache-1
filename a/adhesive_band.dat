40|$|Background: Abdominal crises (vaso-occlusive) are not {{infrequent}} {{in patients}} with sickle cell anemia. They usually present as acute abdomen. These patients none the less present with other causes of acute abdomen like others without hemoglobinopathy. Six cases of surgical acute abdomen in sickle cell disease patients treated in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) are presented. Materials and Methods: Six sickle cell anaemia patients presenting with acute abdominal conditions from 1999 to 2008 (inclusive) in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital were studied retrospectively (two patients) and prospectively (four patients). After initial resuscitation, appropriate surgical procedures, namely, appendicectomy (2), cholecystectomy (1), open drainage of splenic abscess (1), and release of <b>adhesive</b> <b>band</b> (1) were performed. Results: Six cases were treated (female/male ratio 2 : 1). Four patients were in the 11 - 20 year age group. Two patients had appendicectomy and two presented with acute cholecystitis/cholelithiasis, one of whom had open cholecystectomy. One young girl had drainage of splenic abscess and a 42 -year-old male had division of obstructive <b>adhesive</b> <b>band</b> at laparotomy. There were two complications, namely, postoperative haemorrhage (in cholecystectomy patient) and acute chest syndrome (in one appendicectomy patient). These were successfully managed with blood transfusion and antibiotic/oxygen therapy, respectively. There was no mortality.

30|$|Meckel’s {{diverticulum}} (MD) is {{the result}} of the incomplete obliteration of the vitelline ducts. It is often referred to by the rule of 2 ’s: 2 % of the population, within 2  ft of the ileocecal valve, 2  in. in length, 2 types of heterotopic mucosa, and presentation before the age of 2. MD is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract; however, it rarely presents symptomatically. The most common presenting symptom of MD is gastrointestinal bleeding in children; while in adults, the most common presentation is obstruction, either due to intussusception or <b>adhesive</b> <b>bands</b> [3, 4]. In both populations, perforation is an uncommon presentation, particularly among older aged women. Perforated MD often presents as does perforated acute appendicitis; namely with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, and peritoneal signs. This semblance often results in diagnostic inaccuracy. Despite the uncommon incidence of symptomatic MD in adults, the morbidity associated with adult symptomatic MD is significant. The available research, however, remains inconclusive on whether or not an incidental MD should be prophylactically excised.|$|R
40|$|Background: Meckel’s {{diverticulum}} is a {{congenital anomaly}} resulting from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct. The incidence ranges from 0. 3 % to 2. 5 % with most patients being asymptomatic. In some cases, complications involving a Meckel’s diverticulum may mimic other disease processes and obscure the clin-ical picture. Methods: This case presents an 8 -year-old male with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and an examina-tion resembling appendicitis. Results: A CT scan revealed findings consistent with ap-pendicitis with dilated loops of small bowel. During lapa-roscopic appendectomy, the appendix appeared unim-pressive, and an inflamed Meckel’s diverticulum {{was found with}} an <b>adhesive</b> <b>band</b> creating an internal hernia with small bowel obstruction. The diverticulum was re-sected after the appendix was removed. Conclusion: The incidence of an internal hernia with a Meckel’s diverticulum is rare. A diseased Meckel’s diver-ticulum can be overlooked in many cases, especially in those resembling appendicitis. It is recommended that the small bowel be assessed in all appendectomy cases for a pathological Meckel’s diverticulum...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{strain energy}} release rate and {{associated}} param eters are useful measures of <b>adhesive</b> <b>band</b> quality. A properly con toured double cantilever beam specimen excels in measuring these properties.

40|$|Small bowel {{obstruction}} due to postoperative adhesions {{still remains}} an important matter {{in terms of}} frequency, diagnostic and therapeutic commitment and costs. The Authors report on a series observed over 14 years consisting of 63 patients (71 cumulative hospital admissions). Surgery was required in 42 cases (59. 2 %), 23 cases were treated in emergency and 19 cases after failure of conservative treatment. In 29 cases (69 %) the surgical procedure was limited to adhesiolysis, whereas in 13 cases (31 %) an intestinal resection was performed. During operation the mechanisms responsible for obstruction were: strangulation by an <b>adhesive</b> <b>band</b> (39. 4 %), angulation (34 %), bowel loops and volvulus glued together (13. 2 % in each case). The operative mortality was 4. 7 % (2 cases). In 29 cases (40. 8 %), after medical treatment, the obstruction was completely resolved within a mean period of 4. 15 days (range: 2 - 8).

40|$|Small bowel {{obstruction}} {{caused by}} phytobezoars is quite uncommon in patients suffering from acute abdomen. The most common causes of small bowel obstruction are <b>adhesive</b> <b>bands,</b> incarcerated hernia, and adjacent tumor. We present a rare case of phytobezoar-induced small bowel obstruction in a female elderly patient without {{a history of}} abdominal surgery. An 83 -year-old female presented to our emergency department on 5 March 2008 with intermittent vomiting and abdominal pain. After failure of conservative treatment with nasogastric tube decompression and a prokinetic agent, abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast was arranged on March 9, 2008. The CT scan showed marked dilatation of the jejunum with fluid retention and possibly a large calcified bezoar (2. 7 cm × 3. 16 cm) causing obstruction at the ileum. Surgery was performed on March 13, 2008, and the pathologic report showed a fibrocalcified nodule. Based on this case, we have suggest that bezoar-induced small bowel obstruction remains possible even in patients with no history of gastric surgery, autonomic enteropathy, or recent intake of persimmons. Surgical intervention is the standard management for intestinal bezoars, and early diagnosis and intervention reduces morbidity and mortality...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{prospective}} study is presented {{on the amount}} of targeting error that is due to rotational deviations between the atlas and the stereotactic coordinate system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 14 volunteers with a stereotactic frame fixed to their heads by tight <b>adhesive</b> <b>bands.</b> Sagittal, coronal and axial T 2 -weighted MRI scans, as well as MPRage sequences, were performed. The anterior and posterior commissures and one additional point on the midline (the septum pellucidum) were determined on the axial T 2 -weighted images. Bilateral atlas coordinates for the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) and nucleus ventralis intermedius (Vim) were transformed to stereotactic frame coordinates, either without correction or by 2 -point or 3 -point correction. A total of 896 coordinates (x, y, z for the STN, GPi and Vim in both hemispheres) were calculated. RESULTS: Although the mean differences between the two algorithms (0. 24 +/- standard deviation of 0. 33 mm) were within the range of system-immanent inaccuracies in MRI-guided stereotaxy, deviations of up to 2. 8 mm occurred. No significant correlation was found regarding the amount of rotational angle and the differences in x-, y-, or z-coordinates when 2 -point and 3 -point transformations were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of meticulous trajectory planning might be compromised significantly by using only 2 -point-based correction or no calculations at all...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Meckel’s {{diverticulum}} is {{the most}} common congenital gastrointestinal anomaly. However, only 2 % of cases are symptomatic. It can cause intestinal obstruction by various mechanisms as volvulus, adhesions, Littre’s hernia, intussusception.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{mechanical}} stapling devices in laparoscopic appendectomies {{has become a}} common practice. Occasionally, the retained staples have been described to cause adhesions that might result in bowel obstruction. Early bowel obstruction after routine abdominal surgery should be closely investigated and might warrant early re-exploration. We present a rare case of small bowel obstruction caused by a staple line <b>adhesive</b> <b>band</b> one week after appendectomy. A 46 -year-old female underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. A linear endoscopic stapling device was utilized during the procedure. The patient was discharged without complication. One week later, the patient presented {{to the emergency room}} for abdominal pain and she was discharged after adequate pain control. Several hours later she returned with similar symptoms, and she was diagnosed with distal small bowel obstruction by computed tomography scan. During the diagnostic laparoscopy there was an internal hernia through a defect created by the appendiceal staple line and the adjacent small bowel mesentery. After reduction of the hernia, the small bowel venous drainage improved, and no intestinal resection was necessary. The offending staple was removed and the staple line covered with omentum. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms and she was discharged the following day. No perioperative complications occurred. Mechanical staplers are routinely used in laparoscopic appendectomy. The staple line should be inspected {{at the end of the}} procedure to confirm the absence of free, unformed staples that can generate adhesions and postoperative complications...|$|E

40|$|In a fetopathologic {{evaluation}} of 18 cases with amniotic bands, we discerned 3 types of lesions: (1) constrictive tissue bands, (2) amniotic adhesions, and (3) more complex anomaly patterns, designated as limb-body wall complex (LBWC). Constrictive bands {{are caused by}} primary amnion rupture with subsequent entanglement of fetal parts (mostly limbs) by shriveled amniotic strands. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>bands</b> {{are the result of}} a broad fusion between disrupted fetal parts (mostly cephalic) and an intact amniotic membrane. Most of the craniofacial defects (encephaloceles and/or facial clefts) occurring in these fetuses are not caused by constrictive amniotic bands, but are the result of a vascular disruption sequence with or without cephalo-amniotic adhesion. Our observations confirm the fact that amnion rupture is not a conditio sine qua non for the development of LBWC. However, LBWC is often complicated by rupture of the unsupported amnion with ensuing formation of constrictive bands. We think that the concept that considers the 3 lesions in question as a single pathogenetic entity is erroneous and will inevitably lead to a never-ending debate between followers of the 2 prevailing theories. In our view, the theories of Streeter and Torpin are not mutually exclusive but rather apply to different types of lesions. The recognition of constrictive amniotic bands, amniotic adhesions, and LBWC as discrete but often combined disruption sequences with important pathogenetic overlap may resolve many dilemmas in interpretation when a fetus exhibits classical constrictive bands beside more severe defects. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} the hyperosmolar water-soluble contrast medium Gastrografin and reg; in choosing which patients with small-intestine obstruction, caused by post-operative adhesions, to treat conservatively. Summary Background Data: Post-operative abdominal adhesions represent the main aetiological factor for intestinal obstruction. The mortality rate from intestinal obstruction has been quoted at 5 and ndash; 10 %. The most effective way to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by post-operative adhesions is, therefore, through early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Methods: A prospective Gastrografin and reg; study was performed in patients with small-intestine obstruction from June 2010 to June 2011. Results: Fifty-eight patients with adhesive intestinal obstruction received Gastrografin and reg; via a nasogastric tube. Direct abdominal radiographs were taken after 4 and 8 h. Thirty-nine patients (67. 2 %) had Gastrografin and reg; in the right colon within 8 h and were considered to have partial obstruction. These patients commenced oral feeding even though abdominal radiographs revealed gas and ndash;fluid levels. In the remaining 19 patients (32. 7 %), Gastrografin and reg; was not observed in the right colon within 8 h: five of the 19 patients (26. 3 %) were successfully treated conservatively; 14 of the 19 patients (73. 7 %) developed toxic signs and underwent surgery, with obstruction resulting from <b>adhesive</b> <b>bands</b> being confirmed at operation. Conclusions: Conservative treatment can be recommended for patients in whom contrast medium is observed in the right colon within 8 h following administration, regardless of the presence of obstruction signs. Absence of contrast medium in the right colon within 8 h cannot, however, be considered an indication for surgery. [Arch Clin Exp Surg 2013; 2 (1. 000) : 24 - 31...|$|R

40|$|RYGBP) {{has been}} shown to be a safe and {{effective}} alternative to traditional “open”RYGBP. Although lack of postoperative adhesions is one advantage of mini-mally invasive surgery, this is also responsible for a higher incidence of internal hernias. These patients often present with intermittent abdominal pain or small bowel obstruction with completely normal con-trast radiographs. Methods: Data was obtained concurrently on 2, 000 consecutive patients from February 1998 to October 2001 and analyzed retrospectively. Radiographs, when available, were interpreted by both the opera-tive surgeon and radiologist before intervention. Results: 66 internal hernias occurred in 63 patients, an incidence of 3. 1 %. 1 patient presented with a tradi-tional <b>adhesive</b> <b>band</b> and small bowel obstruction. 20 % of patients had normal preoperative small bowel series and/or CT scans. The site of internal hernias varied: 44 - mesocolon; 14 - jejunal mesentery; 5 -Petersen’s space. Although most patients were symp-tomatic, 5 % were incidental findings at the time of another surgical procedure. 5 patients required open repair. 6 patients presented with perforation either at the time of diagnosis or as a result of manipulation of the bowel. There was 1 death associated with compli-cations of the internal hernia. The negative explo-ration rate was 2 %. Conclusion: Internal hernias are more common fol-lowing laparoscopic RYGBP than “open ” RYGBP. Contrast radiographs alone are unreliable in ruling out this diagnosis. Early intervention is crucial; most repairs can be performed laparoscopically. This diag-nosis should be entertained in all patients with un-explained abdominal pain following laparoscopic RYGBP.

The results showed that for the Quantec system the percental average distortion was 8. 14 %, while that for the RBS was 12. 48 %, difference statistically significant at the level of 1 % (a = 0. 01 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pheochromocytoma/paragangliomas {{have been}} {{described}} {{to be associated with}} rare vascular abnormalities like renal artery stenosis. Coexistence of physiologically significant renal artery lesions is a compounding factor that alters management and prognosis of pheochromocytoma patients. Apart from individual case reports, data on such association in Indian population is not available. The aim {{of this study is to}} find the nature and prevalence of associated vascular abnormalities. Materials and Methods: From 1990 to 2010, a total of 50 patients were diagnosed with pheochromocytoma/paragangliomas. Hospital charts of these patients were reviewed retrospectively to identify those with unusual vascular abnormalities. Available literature was also reviewed. Results: Of the 50 patients with pheochromocytoma, 7 (14 %) had coexisting vascular lesions including renal artery stenosis in 4, aortoarteritis in 1, aortic aneurysm in 1 and inferior vena cava thrombosis in 1. Pheochromocytoma was adrenal in 42 and extra adrenal in 8. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was done in the patients. One patient with renal artery stenosis due to intimal fibrosis was subjected to percutaneous balloon angioplasty; the other three improved after adrenalectomy and lysis of fibrous <b>adhesive</b> <b>bands.</b> The patient with aortoarteritos was treated with oral steroids. Inferior vena cava thrombosis was reversed with anticoagulants. The patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm was advised for annual follow-up on account of its size of 4. 5 cm and asymptomatic presentation. Conclusion: There are multiple mechanisms that can lead to renal artery stenosis and other vascular abnormalities in a case of pheochromocytoma. A high index of suspicion is necessary to enable both entities to be diagnosed preoperatively and allow proper planning of surgical therapy. Incomplete diagnosis may lead to persistent hypertension postoperatively in a case of associated renal artery stenosis...|$|R

40|$|National audienceLong {{duration}} super-pressure balloon {{design and}} manufacturing {{is a great}} challenge for the CNES in scientific ballooning. They are made of 50 µm thick polymer films (PET/PA/PET) which are joined with 23 µm thick <b>adhesive</b> PET <b>bands.</b> To date, during flight missions, a real problem appears: some balloons explode prematurely. This is why this study deals with the mechanical behaviour of the stratospheric pressurized balloons and particularly with the assembly of the constitutive materials. Firstly, a nanoindentation test campaign {{makes it possible to}} identify the elastic properties of the materials directly in the assembly at two different temperatures. Then, we simulate a nominal assembly in two approaches: 2 D and 3 D. More particularly, we present an example concerning a defect of the junction in 3 D approach using the submodeling technique. Finally, we use the factorial design method at two levels and finite-element models to study the influence of the various conception parameters on the mechanical behaviour of the assembly...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a dry-electrode harness that permits easy, rapid, and unsupervised self-acquisition of resting 12 -lead ECGs {{without the use of}} any disposables. Various other advantageous features of the harness include: 1) padded or inflatable cushions at the lateral sides of the torso that function to press the left arm (LA) and right arm (RA) dry electrodes mounted on cushions against sideward (as shown in the Figure below) or downward-rested arms of the subject; 2) sufficient distal placement of the arm electrodes with good abutment and without the need for <b>adhesives,</b> straps, <b>bands,</b> bracelets, or gloves on the arms; 3) padding over the sternum to avoid "tenting" in the V 1 through V 3 (and V 3 R, when present) electrode positions; 4) easy-to-don, one-piece design with an adjustable single point of connection and an adjustable shoulder strap; and 5) Lund or "modified Lund" placement of the dry electrodes, the results of which more effectively reproduce results from "standard" 12 -lead ECG placements than do results from Mason-Likar lead placements...|$|R
