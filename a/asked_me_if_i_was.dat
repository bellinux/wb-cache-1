5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
60|$|One evening Mack {{spoke up}} and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much apprised in the habits and {{policies}} of women folks.|$|E
60|$|I told him, {{and he was}} {{attentive}} until I had finished, {{and then}} burst out laughing again, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sore afterwards? I didn't {{ask him if he}} was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.|$|E

60|$|The Secretary of War <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a member}} of the Cabinet, and I said I was. He inquired what {{position}} I held, and I said I was clerk of the Senate Committee on Conchology. I was then ordered under arrest for contempt of court, and restrained of my liberty for {{the best part of the}} day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't pretend I was. If anybody'd have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> married I'd {{have said}} I was. But they just {{took it for}} granted. I wasn't anxious {{to talk about the}} matter [...] . I was feeling too sore over it. It would have been nuts for Mrs. Rachel Lynde if she had known my wife had left me, wouldn't it now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{faith in}} you was never shaken, sweetheart. But I went to Newmarket and Ampthill, and behaved like the ingrate I was. I richly {{deserved}} the scolding {{he had for}} me when I got back to town, which sent me running to Arlington Street. There I met Dr. James coming out, who <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Mr. Carvel, {{and told me that}} you had called my name." ...|$|E

60|$|He said he {{believed}} it would, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> meant to make a library of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{talked a}} great deal about him, {{especially}} Anne Cox. I do not know what she meant, but she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> thought I should go and stay there again next summer." ...|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Teule or Spaniard. I {{told him}} that I was no Spaniard but one of another white race who had Spanish blood in his veins. This saying seemed to puzzle him, for he had never so much as heard of any other white race, so I told him {{something}} of my story, at least {{so much of it}} as had to do with my being cast away.|$|E
60|$|They {{might have}} said, as I {{have no doubt}} they thought, that they had {{believed}} me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment, except that Diana <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure I was well enough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.|$|E
6000|$|But Carry was comforted {{when her}} sister's arms were around her.

60|$|Mrs. Perch {{came to me}} with a {{face like}} a {{squeezed}} lemon, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could lend her five nails.|$|R
6000|$|Next morning my lord <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{willing to}} see my {{daughter}} before she sailed to the Indies. [...] "My lord," [...] said I, [...] "as the seeing of her was the occasion of this great breach that has happened between us, so if your lordship will {{let me have a}} sight of her and a reconciliation with you at the same time, there is nothing can be more desirable to me, or would more contribute to my happiness during the rest of my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only one}} of importance," [...] he answered. [...] "This week, when I went to Coniston, I had a strange experience. I left the brook at a tannery, and a most {{singular}} fellow was in the shed shovelling bark. I {{tried to get him}} to talk, and told him about some new tanning machinery I had seen. Suddenly he turned on me and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 'callatin' to set up a mill.' He gave me a queer feeling. Do you have many such odd characters in Coniston, Miss Cynthia? You're not going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When the Lusitania was torpedoed, a {{man came}} up to me. I'd noticed him more than once--and I'd figured it out {{in my own mind}} that he was afraid of {{somebody}} or something. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a patriotic American, and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or death to the Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch for an advertisement in the Times. If it didn't appear, I was to take them to the American Ambassador.|$|E

6000|$|How much soever I was to blame, yet so it was, I had {{a secret}} joy at {{the news of the}} king's raising an army, and nothing could have {{withheld}} me from appearing in it; but my eagerness was anticipated by an express the king sent to my father, to know if his son was in England; and my father having ordered me to carry the answer myself, I waited upon his Majesty with the messenger. The king received me with his usual kindness, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> willing to serve him against the Scots? ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Warner and I had an {{experience}} of the same sort when we wrote the book called 'The Gilded Age.' There is a character in it called 'Sellers.' I do not remember what his first name was, in the beginning; but anyway, Mr. Warner did not like it, and wanted it improved. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to imagine a person named 'Eschol Sellers.' Of course I said I could not, without stimulants. He said that away out West, once, he had met, and contemplated, and actually shaken hands with a man bearing that impossible name--'Eschol Sellers.' He added-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Now that we {{were out}} upon the dismal {{wilderness}} where they little thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who had brought the soldiers there? He had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a deceiving imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the hunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never {{heard of}} them before, though {{they told me they}} were quite well known. The lady <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had been to Chicago." ...|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning he}} <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to the}} forest of evil fame, and when I replied in the negative, seemed {{surprised}} and, very much to my surprise, evidently disappointed. He even tried to persuade me to go, where before I had been earnestly recommended not to go, until, finding that I would not, he took me with him to hunt in the woods. By and by {{he returned to the}} same subject: he could not understand why I would not go to that wood, and asked me if I had begun to grow afraid.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} in the French {{metropolis}} the day after this reaches you: please look out for a handsome lodging for me, and never mind the expense. And I say, if you could, in her hearing, when you {{came down to the}} coach, call me Captain Pogson, I wish you would--it sounds well travelling, you know; and when she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not an officer, I couldn't say no. Adieu, then, my dear fellow, till Monday, and vive le joy, as they say. The Baroness says I speak French charmingly, she talks English as well as you or I.|$|E
6000|$|She {{understood}} me {{and walked}} off. I thundered {{at the door}} with the children, and as the people were raised before by the noise of the fire, I was soon let in, and I said, 'Is madam awake? Pray tell her Mrs. ---- desires the favour of her to take the two children in; poor lady, she will be undone, their house is all of a flame,' They took the children in very civilly, pitied the family in distress, and away came I with my bundle. One of the maids <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not to leave the bundle too. I said, 'No, sweetheart, 'tis to go to another place; it does not belong to them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, did you?" [...] {{she called}} back pleasantly. [...] "I beg your pardon. <b>I</b> thought you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew it--it's half-past four." ...|$|R
