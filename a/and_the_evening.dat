5|$|Agharta is a 1975 live double album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. By {{the time}} he {{recorded}} the album, Davis was 48 {{years old and had}} alienated many in the jazz community while attracting younger rock audiences with his radical electric fusion music. After experimenting with different line-ups, he established a stable live band in 1973 and toured constantly for the next two years, despite physical pain from worsening health and emotional instability brought on by substance abuse. During a three-week tour of Japan in 1975, the trumpeter performed two concerts at the Festival Hall in Osaka on February 1; the afternoon show produced Agharta <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> show was released as Pangaea the following year.|$|E
