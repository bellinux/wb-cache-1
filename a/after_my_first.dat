His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran {{immigrant}} from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator. Tracht attended DeWitt Clinton High School and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at Ithaca College and landed a job at the college radio station. [...] "From the first day I got on the air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. <b>After</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> year in college, I had this station (WYSL) in Buffalo, New York, offer me a big time job."

60|$|I {{had just}} ridden past the last vedettes {{and hoped that}} I was a free man again, {{when there was a}} soft thudding in the snow behind me, and a heavy man upon a great black horse came swiftly <b>after</b> me. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> impulse was to put spurs to Violette. My second, as I saw a long black beard against a steel cuirass, was to halt and await him.|$|R

60|$|As for the hounds, <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{riding in}} among them, I tell you honestly, I never saw {{so much as}} the tip of one of their tails; nothing in this world did I see except Trumpeter's dun-colored mane, and that I gripped firm: riding, by the blessing of luck, safe through the walking, the trotting, the galloping, and never so much as getting a tumble.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} I {{was lost in}} astonishment, delight, and fear. How and why had Emily gone over to Rome? Who could she have with her {{to take care of}} her and assist her? How on earth had she tracked the missing coin to its distant hiding-place? It was all a {{profound}} mystery to me; and <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> outburst of joy and gratitude, I began to be afraid that Emily might have been misled by her eagerness and anxiety into following up the traces of the wrong coin.|$|E

I married <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> ball. Nobody taught me anything; but I could not help having brains, so I read and caught the tone of the day, and made my own line, while he went on his." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the night}} {{following}} the prisoner's {{visit to the}} audience chamber the conversation finally fell upon this subject, and I was all ears on the instant. I had feared to question Sola relative to the beautiful captive, as I could not but recall the strange expression I had noted upon her face <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> encounter with the prisoner. That it denoted jealousy I could not say, and yet, judging all things by mundane standards as I still did, I felt it safer to affect indifference in the matter until I learned more surely Sola's attitude toward the object of my solicitude.|$|E
60|$|During {{subsequent}} years, whenever I had leisure, I pursued my experiments, and my book on 'Insectivorous Plants' {{was published}} in July 1875--that is, sixteen years <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> observations. The delay in this case, as with all my other books, {{has been a great}} advantage to me; for a man after a long interval can criticise his own work, almost as well as if it were that of another person. The fact that a plant should secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment, closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a remarkable discovery.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew it was}} Sidney Elliot in a moment. He {{was just}} as tall and just as black-eyed; he was still given to {{lounging}} evidently, for he {{was leaning against the}} fence a panel away from me and looking at me with an amused smile. <b>After</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> mad impulse to rush away and bury myself in the wilderness that smile put me at ease. If he had looked grave or polite I would have been as miserably shy as I've always been in a man's presence. But it was the smile of a grandfather for a child, and I just grinned cheerfully back at him.|$|E

40|$|Message {{from the}} Chair A few years ago, I reached the age. No, not that age; I mean the age where {{we start to}} shift our focus solely from the {{elements}} of our career and we start thinking about our legacy in the profession and the workplace. I began to question whether I {{have made a difference}} and if the next generation would remember or appreciate the difference. The older I have gotten, the more I have spoken at conferences and published papers, but <b>after</b> finishing <b>my</b> <b>first</b> 20 years as an SH&E professional, I started thinking about all of my mentors and managers who helped me in my career, gave me guidance and advice and without whose mentoring I would not be the professional I am today.

But instead I am re-made again. I am newly edged. The borders that I thought encom-passed who I am, was, were, are dissolved and dissolving since this daughter's birth. I am taken apart and re-arranged, literally re-newed cell by cell. I {{lost a lot of}} blood after her birth and had to build myself, myblood-self, up again. I spent manyweeks at home in bed thereafter. I lay there with my little newborn girl, in drenching night sweats and fear for my slow recovery, endlessly mentally processing the birth.

6000|$|Afterwards {{there came}} a rush of {{messages}} arising out of the declaration that strained him very much, and in the evening when he was relieved, he ate his scanty supper and then went out upon the little balcony before the station, to smoke and rest his brains after this sudden and as yet inexplicable press of duty. It was a very beautiful, still evening. He fell talking to a fellow operator, {{and for the first}} time, he declares, 'I began to understand what it was all about.

60|$|There {{was nothing}} cheerful about the apartment; on the contrary, {{it struck me}} as being, though magnificent, sombre and heavy, wrapped {{as it was in the}} gloom of a dismal twilight, which the {{flickering}} fire and the shaded lamp failed to pierce. From the high French windows, I could catch a glimpse of a long stretch of soddened lawn, beyond which everything was shrouded in the semi-obscurity of the fast-falling dusk, deepened by the grey, cloudy sky. But I chose, <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> glance around the room, to keep my eyes fixed upon the man who sat writing before me, the man in whom already I felt an interest so strong as to deaden all the curiosity which I might otherwise have felt as to my surroundings.|$|E

The games I wrote prior to that were primitive in comparison—sometimes hilariously, awfully so—but they abound with nostalgia and the charm of innocence.

The only way of hastening his return to England and to Miss Elmslie, who was pining for that return, was the way I had taken.

My occasional occupation with my pen was varied by long traveling excursions {{in all parts of}} the Continent; year by year my circle of gay friends and acquaintances increased, and I bade fair to sink into the condition of a wandering desultory man, without a fixed purpose in life of any sort, when I was saved by what has saved many another in my situation--an attachment to a good and a sensible woman. By the time I had reached the age of thirty-five, I had done what neither of my brothers had done before me--I had married.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{couple of}} months <b>after</b> seeing <b>my</b> <b>first</b> book finally {{published}} in November, 2010, I started feeling different at age 70 +. It {{was as if a}} new dimension was added to my persona. At least, now I am a published author of a book, Scattered Mathematics: Mathematical Reflections, Volume I. When it came to rolling out the next book, it was not for another mathematical one - though its material was ready. The choice fell on a history book - to be written in the most unconventional format. What is my Claim to History? This question has really possessed my mind for a long time. I needed an internal assurance and manifestation of confidence in my history writings. My wife questioned it - based on her knowledge of history textbooks that she had seen or heard of during high school and college days in India. Otherwise, she has no interest in anything historical - from that of a family to a nation. Over years of observation, I dare to conjecture that there is a male gender and history correlation...|$|R
40|$|<b>After</b> {{teaching}} <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{year in a}} {{sixth grade}} class, where the reading levels ranged from 2 to 12, I realized that I needed {{to know more about}} teaching reading. I went back to school and learned a lot more. Then, I worked with a federal project that functioned in about a dozen school districts, so I saw lots of teachers - some very good and some awful- and lots of children. I then taught some more myself and decided that kids never get to be better readers without good teachers. But, that meant more training for me. When I went back to school again, I found that many people who knew far more about teaching reading than I did said the same thing - the teacher is the key to successful reading instruction. Research by Wallace Ramsey (1962), Guy Bond and Robert Dykstra (1967), Sterl Artley (1969) and Albert Harris and Coleman Morrison (1969) has indicated that the teacher is the most important variable in reading instruction...|$|R
