We also tabulated all <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>reported</b> to manufacturers of radiopharmaceuticals com mercially available in the United States. Methods: A prospective 5 -yr study was performed of 18 collaborating institutions using a questionnaire which enumerated monthly the number of procedures used and <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> noted. An algorithm to determine the level of etiologic probability of an <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> from an admin istered radiopharmaceutical was developed. We reviewed all avail able literature on <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in nuclear medicine. Results: During this period, 783, 525 radiopharmaceutical and 67, 835 nonra dioactive drug administrations were analyzed. Ten of the 18 <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to radiopharmaceuticals were rashes. No patient experi encing an <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> to a radiopharmaceutical required hos-pitalization or had significant sequelae.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} {{different approaches}} to promote <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting</b> among health care professionals, determining their cost-effectiveness. METHODS We analyzed and compared several approaches taken by the Northern Pharmacovigilance Centre (Portugal) to promote <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting.</b> Approaches were compared regarding the number and relevance of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reports</b> obtained and costs involved. Costs by report were estimated by adding the initial costs and the running costs of each intervention. These costs were divided {{by the number of}} reports obtained with each intervention, to assess its cost-effectiveness. RESULTS All the approaches seem to have increased the number of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reports.</b> We noted the biggest increase with protocols (321 reports, costing 1. 96 € each), followed by first educational approach (265 reports, 20. 31 €/report) and by the hyperlink approach (136 reports, 15. 59 €/report). Regarding the severity of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> protocols were the most efficient approach, costing 2. 29 €/report, followed by hyperlinks (30. 28 €/report, having no running costs). Concerning unexpected <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> the best result was obtained with protocols (5. 12 €/report), followed by first educational approach (38. 79 €/report). CONCLUSIONS We recommend implementing protocols in other pharmacovigilance centers. They seem to be the most efficient intervention, allowing receiving <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> <b>reports</b> at lower costs. The increase applied not only to the total number of reports, but also to the severity, unexpectedness and high degree of causality attributed to the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions.</b> Still, hyperlinks have the advantage of not involving running costs, showing the second best performance in cost per <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> <b>report...</b>|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} explore patients' knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and opinions on spontaneous <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting</b> in Ghana. A cross-sectional study using questionnaires administered through face-to-face interviews was carried out from 25 August, 2016 to 20 September, 2016 with 442 patients aged 18 years and above selected by convenience sampling from two community pharmacies in urban and rural Ghana. Reasons and opinions on patients' <b>reporting</b> on <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were surveyed using a 5 -point Likert scale. The Pearson chi-square test was used to determine associations between background variables and responses on knowledge of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting.</b> Responses from 434 patients (86. 7 %) were included in the analysis. Among those interviewed, there was a high level of awareness regarding the existence of the National Pharmacovigilance Centre (81. 6 %). Approximately half of the respondents (49. 5 %) were aware that patients were able to <b>report</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> associated with medicinal products directly to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre. Of the respondents, 46. 3 % stated that they had an <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> to their medicines in the past; of these, 53. 2 % reported to healthcare professionals and 36. 9 % failed to report because they stopped their medication. The three main reasons for patients' reporting were desire for extra information (92. 4 %), desire to share experiences with other people (91. 7 %) and expectation for the National Pharmacovigilance Centre to inform others about the possible <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> (88. 0 %). Patients' opinions were to contribute to research/knowledge (96. 5 %) and improvements in drug safety (96. 5 %). Patients' behaviour towards <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting</b> was affected by the likely consequences of reporting, influence of others and the ease of reporting. Patients have a positive attitude and good knowledge on <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting</b> to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre and report because they expect extra information and to contribute to drug safety. Patients' positive attitude towards <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting</b> could be sustained by hosting periodic public awareness campaigns addressing the importance of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> <b>reporting</b> and by providing timely feedback to patients on regulatory decisions taken as a result of the reports that they submitted...|$|R
