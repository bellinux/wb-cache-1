5|$|Moore {{received}} considerable {{recognition in}} the late 1990s and early 2000s, earning Oscar nominations for Boogie Nights (1997), The End of the Affair (1999), Far from Heaven (2002) and The Hours (2002). In {{the first of these}} she played a 1970s pornographic actress, while the other three featured her as an unhappy, mid-20th century housewife. She also had success with the films The Big Lebowski (1998), Magnolia (1999), Hannibal (2001), Children of Men (2006), A Single Man (2009), The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> (2010), and Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), and won several awards for her portrayal of Sarah Palin in the television film Game Change (2012). The year 2014 was key for Moore, as she gave an Oscar-winning performance as an Alzheimer's patient in Still Alice, was named Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for Maps to the Stars, and joined the lucrative Hunger Games series.|$|E
500|$|Moore next starred with Annette Bening in the {{independent}} film The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> (2010), a comedy–drama about a lesbian couple whose teenage children locate their sperm donor. The role of Jules Allgood was written for her by writer–director Lisa Cholodenko, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film's sexual content. The actress {{was drawn to the}} film's [...] "universal" [...] depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore's performance of Jules, who she called an [...] "existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty", writing, [...] "There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera—sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally... and Moore plays every note perfectly." [...] The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.|$|E

In 2008 Barrowman {{presented}} a primetime BBC game show called The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right.</b> On the show, four adults compete against seven [...] "smart and sassy" [...] children for cash in four rounds [...] "testing their brainpower, knowledge {{and speed of}} response".

500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E
500|$|Barrett, {{along with}} Pink Floyd's managers, Peter Jenner and King, wanted {{to release the}} song as a single in the new year, before being vetoed by both the band and Norman Smith.

[...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, those <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone {{to have to go}} as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, but {{if you are going to}} go that disturbed give me something like that. That's great art." [...] Jenner had also called [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] "an extraordinary song, the ultimate self-diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia, [...] the portrait of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, he {{appeared}} in the independent crime drama Winged Creatures (released as Fragments on DVD) alongside Dakota Fanning as they portrayed two teenage friends who survive a massacre, and in Journey to the Center of the Earth, a 3D film adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} where he portrayed a teen who travels to Iceland with an uncle he hardly knows, played by Brendan Fraser. Over the next two years, {{he appeared}} as a boy named Steve [...] "Leopard" [...] Leonard who visits a freak show with his friends in the vampire fiction [...] of the book Cirque du Freak and had a supporting role in the critically acclaimed The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right,</b> portraying the son of a lesbian couple, played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore. According to Kaleem Aftab of The Independent, his role in the film was a pivotal point in his career and one of vital importance to continuing his career into adulthood. Hutcherson expressed gratitude at being cast in the film, displaying satisfaction with the intimacy and creative freedom that independent films provide over studio films. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy in 2010, and was a nominee for Best Picture at the 83rd Academy Awards. Gregory Ellwood of entertainment site HitFix stated: [...] "Hutcherson's charismatic wit and natural instincts shine and it's arguably the first film where he proves he's more than just another sharp-looking teen actor." ...|$|E

500|$|Between landing {{the role}} in The Hunger Games and the film's release, {{he played a}} lead role and served as an {{executive}} producer for two films: Detention (2011) and The Forger (2012). In Detention, he {{played the role of}} popular teenager Clapton Davis in a film the plot of which has been compared to 1985's The Breakfast Club. His role in The Forger was as a 15-year-old orphan who finds himself in trouble until Alfred Molina's character comes to his aid. The film was not well received but the actors' chemistry together and their performance was. He next reprised his role as Sean Anderson in the 2012 Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel, [...] Hutcherson has always been vocal about his desire to work on films of all sorts of genres. Regarding the switch from comedy-drama The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> to the Journey sequel, he stated: [...] "For me, I like to do all different types of films and to go from having that awesome [...] kind of thing that I love doing so much with great characters and a really great script to a bigger kind of studio film, to just cover the whole kind of spectrum of movies is really, really cool." [...] Although the film was largely panned, it fared well commercially and his performance was well received, with Kofi Outlaw of Screenrant.com appreciating how he [...] "does a good job holding the screen and portraying a somewhat layered protagonist". Later in 2012, he appeared in Red Dawn, a remake of the 1984 film of the same name. The film was panned by critics, achieving only a 12 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest score of any film Hutcherson has acted in.|$|E
500|$|Captain Jack {{has gone}} on to become a {{recognisable}} figure in the British public consciousness, and has attracted some parody. These parodies frequently echo criticisms both of the character and of Barrowman's portrayal. The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show Dead Ringers. Played by Jon Culshaw, the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campness, as well his melodramatic personality in Torchwood. In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him. In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen, a race of cyborgs from Doctor Who. Satirical technology columnist Verity Stob wrote a parody of Torchwood Season One in the style of Dylan Thomas's radio play Under Milk Wood, called Under Torch Wood. This parody described Captain Jack as [...] "the insomniac bicon; snug as a hobbit, pretty as a choirboy, immortal as carbon dioxide, wooden as a horse." [...] Barrowman's ubiquity, however, has even provoked criticism of the character. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror, in his review of Children of Earth, said [...] "Unlike David Tennant's Doctor, Barrowman's endless appearances on friendly drivel like Tonight's the Night, The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> and Any Dream Will Do, is so over-exposed, 'Captain Jack' is about as intriguing or alien as a Weetabix and twice as irritating. Unlike Tennant, as an actor he is just not good enough." [...] Television journalist Charlie Brooker, in his Screenwipe review of 2009 criticised Barrowman, with focus on his acting. [...] "Harkness is of course a man of mystery. You can't tell what he's thinking just by looking at his face... no matter how hard Barrowman tries." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 20 February a {{screening}} of the film The Kids <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> was violently interrupted in Bucharest at the Museum of the Romanian Peasant by around 50 extreme-right militants who stopped the screening {{a few minutes after}} it had started. The screening took place as part of the LGBT History Month at the museum. The anti-gay group verbally assaulted film-goers calling them [...] "beasts," [...] "scum" [...] and chanting [...] "Death to the homosexuals," [...] "We don't want you here," [...] and [...] "You are not Romanians." [...] Besides the assault, militants also filmed and photographed attendants. The militants then proceeded to sing the Romanian national anthem and Christian Orthodox chants, and used religious symbols (icons) as well as fascist ones (the Nazi salutes).|$|E
