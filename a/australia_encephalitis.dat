40|$|The acute {{encephalitis}} syndrome has heralded {{the emergence of}} multiple virulent pathogens, including Murray Valley encephalitis, Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus, which may result in severe morbidity and mortality. In <b>Australia,</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is not notifiable {{and there has been}} no analysis of trends in encephalitis death rates or causation. Australian Bureau of Statistics mortality and population data for the period 1979 – 2006 were obtained and cause of death data were extracted using ICD- 9 (1979 – 1998) and ICD- 10 (1999 – 2006) codes that included all relevant encephalitis related diagnoses. Encephalitis-associated deaths were analysed by cause, year, age and gender. Between 1979 and 2006 there were 1, 118 encephalitis-associated deaths in Australia. The average annual death rate was 2. 3 per 1 million population (range 1. 3 – 3. 6). There was a significant decline in encephalitis-associated deaths, particularly due to 'known' pathogens (4. 3 % decline per year, 95 %CI 3. 1 – 5. 4 %, P< 0. 0001). The aetiology of 576 deaths were unknown and the proportion of deaths due to 'unknown' encephalitis increased from 47. 0 % between 1979 and 1992, to 57. 2 % from 1993 to 2006. Downward trends in encephalitis deaths due to 'known' causes can largely be explained by changes in treatment and prevention methods, particularly for herpes encephalitis (use of acyclovir), and measles encephalitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (measles vaccination). The high proportion of encephalitis deaths from 'unknown' pathogens in Australia highlights the importance of monitoring encephalitis morbidity and mortality with a view to improving pathogen diagnosis and identifying emerging infectious diseases...|$|E
40|$|Murray Valley {{encephalitis}} (MVE) virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is {{the most}} common cause of viral encephalitis in the tropical 'Top End' of northern <b>Australia.</b> Clinical <b>encephalitis</b> due to MVE virus has a mortality rate of approximately 30 %, with a similar proportion of patients being left with significant neurological deficits. We report the case of a 25 -year-old man from the UK who acquired MVE while travelling through northern Australia. He required prolonged admission to the Intensive Care Unit and several years later remains partly ventilator-dependent, with flaccid quadriparesis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of MVE virus-induced flaccid paralysis in an adult in northern Australia, although it is well described in children. Paralysis was thought to be due to anterior horn cell involvement in the spinal cord and extensive bilateral thalamic destruction, both of which are well recognised complications of infection with MVE virus. Cases of flaccid paralysis with similar pathology have been described following infection with the related flavivirus Japanese encephalitis virus as well as more recently with West Nile virus. Our case highlights the potential severity of flavivirus-induced encephalitis and the importance of avoiding mosquito bites while travelling through endemic areas...|$|R
