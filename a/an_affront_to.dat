5|$|According {{to their}} {{eugenics}} policy, the Nazis {{believed that the}} disabled were a burden to society because they needed care and were considered <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> their notion of a society composed of a perfect race. About 375,000 people were sterilized against their will due to their disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E

60|$|I {{asked what}} manner of man, {{and what his}} name was; and this {{disclosed}} the cause of John's ill-humour; for it appeared the visitor refused to name himself except <b>to</b> me, <b>a</b> sore <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> the major-domo's consequence.|$|R

5|$|Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is {{considered}} inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision. Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, {{the head of}} Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> religious and human values. Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can only be allowed in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in {{the ground with the}} head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E

50|$|Since {{broadcast}} flags {{could be}} activated at any time, a viewer who often records a program might suddenly {{find that it}} is no longer possible to save their favorite show.

50|$|Like {{his father}} in the {{rebellion}} of 1715, William initially supported the Government side, but in the rebellion of 1745, owing either <b>to</b> <b>a</b> personal <b>affront,</b> <b>to</b> the influence of his wife or to his straitened circumstances he deserted George II and joined Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender.|$|R
5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
25|$|There is {{controversy}} {{around the}} devices; {{much of the}} strongest objection to cochlear implants {{has come from the}} Deaf community.

50|$|Alexander Short - Replaces Gecko in Madness continues. He {{is forced}} to leave the school, fairly early on after it emerges that his Dad has been {{breaking}} the law. Spud develops an intense dislike of him, both because he is rude, arrogant and unfriendly, and because he is replacing Gecko, which Spud sees as <b>a</b> personal <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
50|$|Perdiccas {{seems to}} have viewed this as <b>a</b> direct <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> his {{authority}} and led the royal army to conquer the area. From there Perdiccas turned west towards Phrygia in order to humble Antigonus, who escaped with his son Demetrius to Greece, where he obtained the favour of Antipater, regent of Macedonia (321 BC), and Craterus.|$|R
25|$|Most white Americans in the 1950s {{were opposed}} to interracial {{marriage}} and did not see laws banning interracial marriage as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> the principles of American democracy. A 1958 Gallup poll showed that 94 percent of white Americans disapproved of interracial marriage. However, attitudes towards bans on interracial marriage quickly changed in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{conventions}} of both major parties had just affirmed the finality of every provision of the Compromise of 1850, including the Fugitive Slave Act, Sumner called for the Act's repeal.

25|$|Manuel Noriega became {{politically}} active at this time, {{and joined the}} Socialist party's youth wing. He did not stand out {{as a leader in}} the movement, preferring instead to stick to his books. But he wrote and published nationalist poems and articles attacking the US presence in Panama as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> attacking to Panamanian sovereignty.|$|E
50|$|Western {{countries}} {{decried the}} election as a farce and <b>an</b> egregious <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> {{democracy and human}} rights. The United States and the European Union called {{for the release of}} all imprisoned former candidates, but took no further action except a travel ban on Lukashenko. By contrast, countries such as Syria, China, Vietnam, and Russia congratulated the re-elected incumbent.|$|R
5000|$|Elizabeth I of England {{was furious}} that two noble houses had fought a private battle, defying the {{authority}} she claimed over the Kingdom of Ireland. The {{fact that both}} sides had displayed their banners in the battle was <b>a</b> particular <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> her - it was a symbolic rejection of the monopoly of the crown on making war.|$|R
50|$|Wishing {{to remain}} a virgin Polyphonte fled to the {{mountains}} to become a companion of Artemis. This provoked the ire of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and procreation, who viewed Polyphonte’s decision as <b>a</b> personal <b>affront.</b> <b>To</b> punish Polyphonte for failing to honor her womanly duty, Aphrodite drove her mad and caused her to lust after a bear.|$|R
25|$|Open {{defecation}} perpetuates {{the vicious}} cycle {{of disease and}} poverty and {{is widely regarded as}} <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> personal dignity. The countries where open defecation is most widely practised have the highest numbers of deaths of {{children under the age of}} five, as well as high levels of undernutrition, high levels of poverty, and large disparities between the rich and poor.|$|E
25|$|This American {{violation}} of operating in Italian airspace and landing in a Roman airport without overflight or landing permissions, {{was seen by}} the Italians as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> their laws and safety regulations and negatively influenced diplomatic relations between the countries for some time. Diplomatic relations with Egypt also were negatively impacted as they continued to demand an apology from the U.S. for forcing the airplane off course.|$|E
25|$|Loss of the Mekong River {{town was}} too great <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> Lao {{nationhood}} to be borne.

25|$|There was an American Samoa Mau {{that took}} place in Tutuila in American Samoa in the 1920s. It emerged as a result of {{fluctuating}} prices of copra and represented <b>an</b> open <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> the American Navy and its patterns of treatment of the indigenous Samoan people and failure to respect Samoan customs, conceptions of self-government and the Samoan way of life.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is {{something that needs to be}} cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Algiers from 1830 to 1962 {{is bound to}} the larger history of Algeria and its {{relationship}} to France. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> the French consul—whom the dey had hit with a fly-whisk when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants—a French army under General de Bourmont attacked the city in the 1830 invasion of Algiers. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of French Algeria.|$|E
25|$|The new {{religions}} (in particular, Calvinism {{and other}} more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully using hard earned money and identified {{the purchase of}} luxuries as a sin. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of icons. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to charity was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and <b>an</b> <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.|$|E
2500|$|Thailand has no {{office of}} a presidency. The King {{is the head of}} state, and the prime {{minister}} is the head of government.

50|$|The {{murder of}} Matthew Bevilaqua was vengeance, {{an act that}} had to be carried out since the fact that Christopher was shot was <b>a</b> direct <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> him as Boss.
