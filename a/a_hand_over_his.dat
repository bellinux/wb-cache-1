60|$|Kirk Winfield passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left {{forehead}} and followed her. Like George, he found Mrs. Porter a trifle overwhelming.|$|E
60|$|Now, indeed, her {{listener}} seemed perplexed. He passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shiny {{bald head}} as if to stimulate thought and exorcise bewilderment.|$|E
60|$|Throughout the reading, the fleshy {{eyes of the}} inquisitor {{had been}} steadily, inscrutably {{regarding}} me. He passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> pendulous chin, as the thin voice faded into silence.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cooper, putting <b>a</b> huge <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth, {{struggled}} nobly {{with his}} feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No!' He passed <b>a</b> wet <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> streaky forehead. 'Wasn't there {{a bicycle}} {{that was the}} {{beginning}} of this trouble?' said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wha--what are {{you doing}} here?" [...] stammered the young second mate, when, waiting for no more words, Peterson clapped <b>a</b> dirty <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] he queried. [...] "Gesu!" [...] And {{he passed}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> damp brow, and threw back the hair that cumbered it. [...] "What {{is the thing}} that you would do, Fool?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Firmin {{adjusted}} a strap, passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> wet forehead, {{and followed}} earnestly. 'I admit, sir,' {{he said to}} a receding back, 'that {{there has to be}} some sort of hegemony, some sort of Amphictyonic council----' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{representative}} of omnipotence {{looked as if}} he had left most of these things to his subordinates; he passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> wrinkling brow and said in a voice much saner than any he had yet used: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had {{a mix-up}} and came off second best----" [...] began {{one of the}} soldiers, when an Indian guard clapped <b>a</b> dirty <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth and ordered him to be silent, under penalty of death.|$|R
6000|$|Something, a breath, {{the light}} caress of <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> passed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> hair, and a whisper {{that was almost}} tone spoke in his ear, [...] "Fear nothing, if you will be guided and protected." ...|$|R
60|$|We entered {{with our}} prisoner, Pierre {{leading the way}} {{grasping}} Horry by the coat-collar, while I brought up the rear with my arm around the Tory's neck so that I might keep <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> clapped <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} here that I {{did not understand}} at all. And in like case, it seemed, was Fra Gervasio, for he passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> brow, as if to clear thence some veils that clogged his understanding.|$|E
60|$|He placed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> heart. This {{seemed to}} depress him still further. Finally {{he went to}} the table, took up the glass, poured its {{contents}} carefully back into the bottle, which he corked and replaced on the shelf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in," [...] said Mrs. Hatchard, {{breathing}} hard Mr. Hatchard obeyed, and clapping <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth ascended the stairs behind her. At the top she {{threw open the}} door of a tiny bedroom, and stood aside for him to enter. Mr. Hatchard sniffed critically.|$|E
60|$|But Bibot passed <b>an</b> {{unsteady}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> brow. It was cold, {{yet he was}} in a perspiration. That sort {{of thing}} tells on a man's nerves. He rejoined Marat, at the table outside the drinking booth, and ordered a fresh bottle of wine.|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned his}} head on his <b>hands</b> for <b>a</b> moment, and {{as he did so}} a sound behind him caused his heart to leap with guilty fear, but before he could rise, <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> came <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} and grasped the file.|$|R
5000|$|... 1801 - John Maxwell (of Dargavel, {{and son of}} John below),suffering from <b>a</b> paralysis, <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> law {{practice}} to Colin D Donald (1777-1859) (a cousin). CDD was trained by James Dundas CS. James {{was the father of}} John Dundas who with Charles Wilson founded Dundas & Wilson.|$|R
60|$|Paui Blunt had hastily risen on an arm, {{and he now}} passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> brow, as if to {{make certain}} that he was awake. He had not undressed himself, and in another moment he stood on his feet {{in the middle of the}} state-room.|$|E
60|$|Old Andries passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{in the way}} one is apt to do when {{he wishes}} to aid a mental effort by {{external}} application. It was evident he was puzzled {{to find out what the}} squatter would be at, though he soon put a question that brought about something like an explanation.|$|E
6000|$|Peter Rabbit {{almost forgot}} {{that he was}} hiding. He was so eager to hear that story that he {{was right on the}} point of {{speaking}} up and begging Ol' Mistah Buzzard to tell it when he remembered Old Man Coyote. Just {{in the nick of time}} he clapped <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth. It seemed to Peter a long, long time before Old Man Coyote said: ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the other}} side of the door {{proceeded}} a sound like water gurgling from a bottle, mingled with cries half suppressed, as if somebody were being prevented from uttering them by <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> laid <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth. The sufferer appeared to have a high voice.|$|R
60|$|Her husband yawned, and smiled, {{and almost}} as if lit with that thin last {{sunshine}} seemed the smile that passed for an instant across the reverie of his shadowy face. He drew <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> wearily <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes. 'What has he been saying now?' he inquired like a fretful child.|$|R
6000|$|The pale-faced man {{peered down}} the microscope. He was evidently not {{accustomed}} {{to that kind of}} thing, and held <b>a</b> limp white <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> disengaged eye. [...] "I see very little," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Richard stood up, leaning {{his full}} weight upon the arm the {{landlord}} had about his waist. He passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> brow, {{as if to}} brush aside the veil that obscured his wits. What had happened? What had he said? What had Trenchard done? Why did these fellows stand and gape at him? He heard his companion's voice, raised to address the company.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it'd be {{me for the}} dishwater an' the jellyfish, I guess." [...] He {{straightened}} up {{in his chair and}} threw back his shoulders unconsciously as he ran <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> biceps and swelled it. Then he took another look at Saxon. [...] "But thank the Lord I still got a wallop in both my arms an' a wife to fill 'em with love." ...|$|E
60|$|This answer puzzled old Holmes a good deal. He passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, {{and turned}} to his companion, one Tubbs, also a tenant on my estate, as if to ask assistance. Tubbs {{was one of the}} new school; a school that makes more laws than it respects, and belongs to the movement. He is a man that fancies the world never knew {{anything}} of principles, facts, or tendencies, until the commencement of this century.|$|E
6000|$|Chitterlow hesitated. [...] "Half a mo', my boy," [...] he said, {{and arrested}} Kipps by {{extending}} <b>a</b> large <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest. [...] "Excuse me, my dear," [...] he said, bowing like his Russian count {{by way of}} apology to Helen and {{with a smile that}} would have killed at a hundred yards. He affected a semi-confidential grouping of himself and Kipps while Helen stood in white amazement.|$|R
6000|$|... (Chalmers, {{making an}} unusually violent {{effort to get}} at Knox, {{suddenly}} staggers weakly back, signs of pain on his face, holding <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> convulsively clasped <b>over</b> <b>his</b> heart. Margaret catches him and supports him to a chair, into which he collapses.) ...|$|R
60|$|Morel {{walked on}} a few strides, then leaned up against <b>a</b> truck-side, <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes. He was not crying. Paul stood looking round, waiting. On the {{weighing}} machine a truck trundled slowly. Paul saw everything, except his father leaning against the truck {{as if he were}} tired.|$|R
60|$|Standing thus, {{he passed}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes and stared again, two hectic spots burning {{now in his}} white cheeks. Abruptly, {{disregarding}} the superscription, his trembling fingers snapped the blank seal and unfolded the letter addressed to his royal master. He was still reading when the chamberlain returned to announce that the King {{was pleased to see}} the Baron at once. He did not seem to hear the announcement. His attention was all upon the letter, his lips drawn back from his teeth in a grin, and beads of perspiration glistening upon his brow.|$|E
6000|$|Dear me, dear me! Grandfather Frog was boasting. If he {{had been}} safe {{at home in the}} Smiling Pool, there might have been some excuse for boasting, but way over here in the Long Lane, not even knowing {{the way back to the}} Smiling Pool, it was foolish, very foolish indeed. No one knew that better than Striped Chipmunk, but he has a great deal of respect for Grandfather Frog, and he knew too that Grandfather Frog was feeling very much out of sorts and very much mortified to think that {{he had been}} caught in such a scrape, so he put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth to hide a smile as he said: ...|$|E
60|$|The surgeon {{stood for}} a moment, deeply {{studying}} the outward symptoms of his patient, and then he silently took {{her hand in his}} own. It was seldom that the hard and abstracted features of Sitgreaves discovered any violent emotion; all his passions seemed schooled, and his countenance did not often betray what, indeed, his heart frequently felt. In the present instance, however, the eager gaze of the aunt and sister quickly detected his emotions. After laying his fingers for a minute on the beautiful arm, which, bared to the elbow and glittering with jewels, Sarah suffered him to retain, he dropped it, and dashing <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, turned sorrowfully away.|$|E
6000|$|His mother, {{dressed for}} the street, came in where he sat quiet at his desk, with the editor's letters and the girl's before him, and he mutely {{referred}} them to her with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> lifted <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. She read them, and then she said, [...] "This is hard to bear, Philip. I wish I could bear it for you, or at least with you; but I'm late for my engagement with Mrs. Alfred, as it is--No, I will telephone her I'm detained and we'll talk it over--" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Testator {{lived in}} his {{furnished}} chambers {{two or three}} years, or more, and gradually lulled himself into the opinion that the furniture was his own. This was his convenient state of mind when, late one night, a step came up the stairs, and <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> passed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> door feeling for his knocker, and then one deep and solemn rap was rapped {{that might have been}} a spring in Mr. Testator's easy- chair to shoot him out of it; so promptly was it attended with that effect.|$|R
25|$|The Roman Priscilla catacombs {{depict the}} oldest Marian {{paintings}} {{from the middle}} of the 2nd century: Mary is shown with Jesus on her lap, a standing man with tunic left <b>hand</b> <b>a</b> book right <b>hand</b> <b>a</b> star <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head symbol of messiahs. Priscilla also has a depiction of the annunciation.|$|R
