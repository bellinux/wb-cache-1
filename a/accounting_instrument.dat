In order to answer this question, it combines Van Loon’s model of the dynamics of financial management with Mintzberg’s model of organisational structure.

However, it also shows that in some circumstances the use of instruments that are very sophisticated may not be feasible or desirable. This occurs, for example, when managers do not have enough time available to use such instruments or when decision makers attach more importance to professional performance indicators than to financial performance indicators. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores how {{symbolic}} ideas {{embedded in}} an <b>accounting</b> <b>instrument</b> {{come to be}} enacted in practice: detailing the processes through which they are realised by actors. It draws on theories of governmentality and the institutional logics perspective to develop a holistic theorisation of how programmes, ideas or ‘logics’ come to be enacted in practice as individuals interact with a performance appraisal process. It seeks to develop a theorised narrative that unpicks the various realities which actors construct in a particular assemblage. The story is informed by an abductive case study of one branch of John Lewis Department Stores. It develops a model which details the factors which influence the effective performativity of the <b>accounting</b> <b>instrument.</b> As such it explores how governance occurs as non-local ideas are prescribed to, and then enacted in, a local domain. The model describes how actors interact with a ‘mediating instrument’ and thereby constitute multiple realities based on three moderating factors: underlying ties to existing logics, self-interest and others’ influence. In outlining these moderating factors the thesis also highlights that multiple logics {{are more likely to}} be enacted when they are added or merged to existing sense making, in comparison to when they are framed or reframed according to those existing framings. As such it contributes to governmentality by detailing the process of governing and unpacking the factors which influence whether a mediating instrument is effectively performative. Additionally it contributes to institutional theory by providing a more nuanced understanding of how the symbolic elements of logics come to be enacted in practice through interactions with such material artefacts and how actors come to recognise the legitimacy of alternatives...|$|E

For these reasons, the attention was mainly focused on making specific norms, concerning the structure and evaluation of the financial statement, aiming to limit the liberty enjoyed by the administrators in choosing the rules to adopt in making the balance sheet. The fact that each evaluation of a patrimonial item is changing, varying with the purpose the one that makes the balance sheet proposes to get to by evaluation, was recognized; therefore deriving the necessity not to let to the administrators the decision concerning the way that the patrimonial elements will be evaluated, a highly- important decision and with a practically relevant impact over the obtained results{{annual financial statement}}, economic result, financial accounting phenomenon, accounting system...|$|E

To this aim, the paper focuses on a specific instrument – the Environmental Profit and Loss Account – that grounds on the idea of complementing the traditional profit and loss account by including figurative revenues and costs associated to the environmental impact of business activities. Based on the empirical evidence, derived from a multinational Do-It-Yourself retailing chain, the paper discusses how key design choices in the process of development of the Environmental Profit and Loss Account should be carried out to use this instrument as an input for the reward system and what problems and criticisms this choice implies.
