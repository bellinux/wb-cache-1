5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised {{as one of the}} parliament's most gifted <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate <b>and</b> <b>articulate,</b> two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either of the other two. However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E

25|$|In {{defiance}} of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates. She says that when the critics assume that intelligent <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> autistic people do not have difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with self-care, they affect the opinions of policy makers and {{make it more difficult for}} intelligent <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> autistic people to get services. Baggs cites an example of an autistic person who was denied services when it was discovered that she could type.|$|E

25|$|The hips {{consist of}} the pelvis, which {{includes}} three major bones: the ilium (top of the hip), ischium (sides of hip), and pubis (front of the hip). These are fused into one (the innominate bone). Innominate bones are evolutionary significant {{in that they}} allow birds to lay eggs. They meet at the acetabulum (hip socket) <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> with the femur, {{which is the first}} bone of the hind limb.|$|E

25|$|The many sermons of Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) on the Virgin Mary {{reflect his}} belief in various Marian doctrines that were {{declared}} as dogmas centuries after his death. He reflected on the Assumption of Mary and referring to Psalm 132 argued that, just as Jesus had risen up to Heaven, so did Mary. He also supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception. Given that Anthony {{was one of the}} best educated <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> of the early Franciscans, he was treated as a Doctor of the Church by his order, even before the title was granted to him in 1946.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted that Barnard was the more expressive writer of the two, and that Eldershaw contributed her acute critical sense, Rorabacher also states that in their early collaborative novels {{it is impossible to}} distinguish their separate contributions. Overall, Barnard did more of the creative writing while Eldershaw focused on the structure and development of their major works. However, because Eldershaw was the more outgoing <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> of the two, it was frequently assumed, at the time, that she was the dominant partner. This did not spoil their partnership, which lasted two decades, bearing testament to the fact that both derived value from it.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{remained}} a respected and influential adviser to various government agencies throughout his {{tenure at the}} university. He was outspoken in matters of timber and natural resource conservation, fiscal responsibility, constitutional and education reform, and especially human rights. He was capable <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> in framing current policy against the lessons of history and careful to skillfully represent only primary sources whenever possible – a praxis which earned him immense respect, not only in Kentucky and the US, but around the world. His public visibility earned him a name for taking an appreciation of history to the people – not hiding {{in the halls of}} academia.|$|E

25|$|This {{variation}} between 'I' and 'me' (nominative and accusative) in object {{position has}} been linked to the social concerns of politeness and elevated language. This non-standard use of the nominative case in object position carries a certain linguistic prestige. People using this form are often perceived as educated <b>and</b> <b>articulate.</b> This variation shows up frequently in newspapers, magazines and political speeches as well as in daily conversation. Conversely, the use of the standard variant 'my wife and me' may seem to signal casualness or lack of sophistication. This illustrates how case marking is not only a system to be followed, but one that can be used creatively to encode particular social meanings.|$|E
25|$|While the trustees' honorary degree {{committee}} {{approved the}} honorees unanimously, five student {{members of the}} committee wrote to complain that they had to vote on the five honorees as a slate in the final stage of the voting, and felt the selection of Schlafly was a mistake despite her prominence as a famous WU graduate. In {{the days leading up to}} the commencement ceremony, Washington University Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton explained the trustees' decision to award Schlafly’s degree with the following statement:In bestowing this degree, the University is not endorsing Mrs. Schlafly's views or opinions; rather, it is recognizing an alumna of the University whose life and work have had a broad impact on American life and have sparked widespread debate and controversies that in many cases have helped people better formulate <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> their own views about the values they hold.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{military}} leadership of Toussaint, the forces made up mostly of former slaves succeeded in winning concessions from the British and expelling the Spanish forces. In the end, Toussaint essentially restored control of Saint-Domingue to France. Louverture was very intelligent, organized <b>and</b> <b>articulate.</b> Having made himself {{master of the}} island, however, Toussaint {{did not wish to}} surrender too much power to France. He began to rule the country as an effectively autonomous entity. Louverture overcame a succession of local rivals, including: the Commissioner Sonthonax, a French white man who gained support from many Haitians, angering Louverture; André Rigaud, a free man of color who fought to keep control of the South in the War of Knives; and Comte d'Hédouville. Hédouville forced a fatal wedge between Rigaud and Louverture before he escaped to France. Toussaint defeated a British expeditionary force in 1798. In addition, he led an invasion of neighboring Santo Domingo (December 1800), and freed the slaves there on January 3, 1801.|$|E

25|$|John Sless {{has worked}} at the Brantford Charity Casino and as an {{independent}} consultant. He ran for the Brantford city council in 1974 and 1976 and was defeated both times; on the latter occasion, he was backed by the United Auto Workers. He was elected for the city's second ward in 1991 and was re-elected in 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006. Sless was regarded as an ally of mayor Chris Friel on council until the latter's defeat in 2003. He supported a long-term plan for downtown revitalization in 2002, {{was known as a}} supporter of sports and recreation programs, and in general opposed proposals for harsh cuts in municipal services. Some local writers have noted that Sless was a clear <b>and</b> <b>articulate,</b> but not a frequent speaker on council. He was the most prominent opponent of a plan to demolish several buildings {{on the south side of}} Colbourne Street in 2010; he argued that the demolition was not properly budgeted and that there was no plan for redevelopment.|$|E
25|$|The divers Cubist {{considerations}} manifested {{prior to}} World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now {{been replaced by}} a formal reference frame which constituted the second phase of Cubism, based upon an elementary set of principles that formed a cohesive Cubist aesthetic. This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists exhibiting at Léonce Rosenberg's gallery—including Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Jacques Lipchitz, Henry Laurens, Auguste Herbin, Joseph Csaky, Gino Severini and Pablo Picasso—leading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by Maurice Raynal, an early promoter of Cubism and continuous supporter during the war and post-war phase that followed. Raynal had been associated with Cubists since 1910 via the milieu of Le Bateau-Lavoir. Raynal, who would become one of the Cubists most authoritative <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> proponents, endorsed a wide range of Cubist activity and for those who produced it, but his highest esteem was directed toward two artists: Jean Metzinger, whose artistry Raynal equated with Renoir and who was 'perhaps the man who, in our epoch, knows best how to paint'. The other was Juan Gris, who was 'certainly the fiercest of the purists in the group'.|$|E
25|$|Basal Ichthyopterygia, {{like their}} land-dwelling ancestors, still had {{vertebrae}} that possessed {{a full set}} of processes that allowed them to interlock <b>and</b> <b>articulate,</b> forming a vertebral column supporting the weight of the body. As ichthyosaurs were fully aquatic, their bodies were supported by the Archimedes force exerted by the water; in other words, they were buoyant. Therefore, the vertebral processes had lost much of their function. Early ichthyosaurs proper had rear dorsal vertebrae that had become disc-shaped, like those of typical fishes. With more derived species, the front dorsals also became discs. Gradually, most processes were lost, including those for rib attachment. The vertebral bodies became much shorter. The front and rear sides of the discs were hollowed out, resulting in a so-called amphicoelous condition. A transverse cross-section of such a vertebra has an hourglass shape. This morphology is unique within the Amniota and makes discerning ichthyosaur vertebrae from those of other marine reptiles easy. The only process that kept its function was the spine at the top, serving as an attachment for the dorsal muscles. However, even the spine became a simple structure. The neural arch, of which it was an outgrowth, typically no longer fused to the vertebral centre.|$|E

500|$|Finally, Carr {{places his}} {{skepticism}} {{in a historical}} context, reflecting upon how previous detractors of technological advances have fared. While often correct, Carr points out that skepticisms such as Socrates' concerns about written language and the 15th-century Venetian editor Hieronimo Squarciafico's concerns about printed works failed to anticipate the benefits that these technologies might hold for human knowledge. As an afterthought, a 2005 essay by playwright Richard Foreman is excerpted for its lament of the waning of the [...] "highly educated <b>and</b> <b>articulate</b> personality".|$|E
