5|$|The Water Boiler was an aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactor, a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is dissolved in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of uranium nitrate because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the Water Boiler did take up <b>an</b> <b>inordinate</b> amount of T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the Water Boiler.|$|E

40|$|Eyes {{often take}} {{a central role}} in discussions of evolution, with debate focused on how often such complex organs might have evolved. One such debate is whether {{arthropod}} compound eyes are the product of single or multiple origins. Here we use molecular phylogeny to address this long-standing debate and find results favoring the multiple-origins hypothesis. Our analyses of DNA sequences encoding rRNA unequivocally indicate that myodocopids—the only Ostracoda (Crustacea) with compound eyes—are nested phylogenetically within several groups that lack compound eyes. With our well-supported phylogeny, standard maximum likelihood (ML) character reconstruction methods significantly reconstruct ancestral ostracods as lacking compound eyes. We also introduce a likelihood sensitivity analysis, and show that the single-origin hypothesis is not significantly favored unless we assume a highly asymmetric model of evolution (one favoring eye loss more than 30 : 1 over gain). These results illustrate exactly why arthropod compound eye evolution has remained controversial, because one of two seemingly very unlikely evolutionary histories must be true. Either compound eyes with detailed similarities evolved multiple times in different arthropod groups or compound eyes have been lost in <b>a</b> seemingly <b>inordinate</b> number of arthropod lineages...|$|R

25|$|During {{the middle}} {{years of the}} 18th century, {{politics}} in New York revolved around the rivalry of two great families, the Livingstons and the De Lanceys.

40|$|Summary. The role of {{membrane}} phosphatides in transport processes {{has been}} investigated in red cells from splenectomized patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Incorporation of inorganic 32 phosphate into the membrane phosphatides of HS red cells was approximately twice normal, coinciding with the nearly two-fold increment in flux of sodium ions in the cells. <b>A</b> consistent, <b>inordinate</b> increase in specific activity of a chromatographic fraction containing phosphatidylserine provided {{the bulk of the}} over-all in-crease in labeling of HS red cell phosphatides. The specific activity of phos-phatidic acid was increased but not consistently. Radioactivity of the "acidic phosphatides " (phosphatidylserine and phos-phatidic acid fractions) decreased, in general, when the sodium flux was low, i. e., when the cells were suspended in media of low sodium content. When the cation flux was elevated (hypotonic media), there was a marked (ca. 35 %) increase in the labeling of phosphatidylserine fractions. Normal red cells whose permeability to cations was increased by exposure to 0. 5 N butanol also exhibited increased labeling of acidic phosphatides. Considerations of the stoichiometry of cation transport and phosphatide labeling make it unlikely that phospholipids act directly as carrier molecules for cations in red cell membranes. On the other hand, the involvement of these lipid substances in cation movements is substantiated by correlating several different states of sodium flux with the labeling of the phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine fractions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Inflation is {{associated}} with rising price. It is {{a situation in which}} there is <b>a</b> sustained, <b>inordinate</b> (excessive), and general increase in prices. The increase in prices must last for a reasonable period of time. If prices go up during this period and fall in the next, then it is mere price fluctuation. The increase in price must be excessive by that country's experience. Inflation is the rise in average price of all goods that we buy and not just of one item. After analyzing the trend of inflation rate, number of L/C and value of L/C opened in Prime Bank Limited, Khulna Branch in the last five years, it is seen that there is a minimum or very insignificant correlation between inflation and import trade. Theoretically, there is a positive correlation between domestic inflation and import. This study also shows a positive correlation, but the correlation is very insignificant. Obviously, there are some reasons behind this insignificance. We should remember that, inflation is not the only factor that can affect the import trade. There are many other factors that can influence the import trade of a country. In case of Bangladesh, the reasons are the massive pressure on the demand of goods available, exchange rate fluctuation, huge population, frequent natural disasters of Bangladesh, different government policies, relationship with the exporting country, inflation rate of the exporting country etc. As so many factors are influencing the import of a country, that’s why inflation cannot create a huge pressure on the import...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{economic}} problems that the citizens of Guwahati {{have to put up}} with is the hike in prices of many essentials, chiefly vegetable, poultry and fish. The prices of these commodities keep escalating at <b>an</b> <b>inordinate</b> rate because of which the buyers find it difficult to buy these items. Vegetables are transported into Assam from West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra and Meghalaya and the truckers en route have to pay considerable amount of money as tax at various check posts. It is one of the causes of rise in prices of vegetables in the markets of Guwahati. The prices of locally available vegetables and fruits undergo large markup because of transportation expenses grounds, besides intra-State check posts taxes. In addition to these, the wholesale dealers as well as the retail sellers augment the prices of the commodities according to their own desires. The prices of poultry, mainly chicken that reach the city markets from places like Chaygaon and Barpeta have been soaring rapidly because of similar factors. There has been steep rise in the prices of fishes as well, the prominent varieties of which being Rohu ("Rou"), Catla ("Bahu"), Walking catfish ("Magur") and Monopterus ("Kuchia") among many others.|$|E

I trust that I was able to bear your very considerable abridgment of my lucubrations with a spirit becoming a Christian. My third granddaughter, Rebekah, aged fourteen years, and whom I have trained to read slowly and with proper emphasis (a practice too much neglected in our modern systems of education), read aloud to me the excellent essay upon 'Old Age,' the author of which I cannot help suspecting to be {{a young man who}} has never yet known what it was to have snow (canities morosa) upon his own roof.

40|$|Trucks usually {{queue up}} along Obajana – Kabba Express Road waiting for loading of {{finished}} Portland cement produced by Obajana Cement Plc. Waiting time of trucks {{can be more}} than three days before been loaded and it may reach seven days in dry season when cement is usually on high demand. The long unending queue occasionally caused traffic jam and various degrees of accidents on the road. The waiting line optimization problem determines the number of service facilities and queue priorities or rules that minimize cost of an operation. Because <b>a</b> company incurs <b>inordinate</b> cost if it has idle servers, and also if it has too many customers (trucks) waiting to be loaded, the optimization problem becomes one of minimizing the total cost to the company. In this work, the cement (end product) loading system of Obajana Cement Company Plc was studied. The average arrival rate of trucks and the average service rate of the loading facility were evaluated for the queuing system. The study show that the traffic intensity of the current system is more than unity and consequently, the queue cannot cope.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} how fine-grain synchronization can be supported on <b>a</b> multiprocessor without <b>inordinate</b> amounts of hardware, and described Alewife's implementation. The paper motivated {{the use of}} fine-grain synchronization as an attractive method of synchronizing programs that avoids unnecessary serialization, and hence maximizes concurrency. We argued that efficient fine-grain synchronization requires support {{at all levels of}} a multiprocessor system. Driven by the desire the control the complexity of hardware, we identified successful synchronizations to be the common case in fine-grain synchronization and provided hardware support for that case. The system handles the common case of successful synchronizations very fast, in fact at virtually the same speed as normal, non-synchronizing reads and writes. Experimental results indicate that a high percentage of fine-grain synchronization operations succeed. Failed synchronizations that need to wait are detected via traps and handled entirely in software. The trap handlers implement sophisticated waiting algorithms that rely on useful information from the compiler to reduce the cost of waiting. The compiler communicate this information to the trap handlers using otherwise unused bits in the instruction. For programmability, we provide language support in parallel versions of C and T to allow a user to specify fine-grain synchronization in a straightforward manner. We have implemented a number of parallel programs that utilize fine-grain synchronization specified with the provided language support.

I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes {{flashing}} from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided; women {{of the town of}} all kinds and of all ages--the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth--the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags--the wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at youth--the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable--some in shreds and patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes--some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces--others clothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well brushed--men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside these, pie-men, porters, coal--heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all full of <b>a</b> noisy and <b>inordinate</b> vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.|$|R
6000|$|I {{know that}} none of this wrong is done with {{deliberate}} purpose. I know, on the contrary, that you wish your workmen well; that you do much for them, and that you desire to do more for them, if you saw your way to such benevolence safely. I know that even all this wrong and misery are brought about by a warped sense of duty, each of you striving to do his best; but, unhappily, not knowing for whom this best should be done. And all our hearts have been betrayed by the plausible impiety of the modern economist, telling us that, [...] "To do the best for ourselves, is finally to do the best for others." [...] Friends, our great Master said not so; and most absolutely we shall find this world is not made so. Indeed, to do the best for others, is finally to do the best for ourselves; but it will not do to have our eyes fixed on that issue. The Pagans had got beyond that. Hear what a Pagan says of this matter; hear what were, perhaps, the last written words of Plato,--if not the last actually written (for this we cannot know), yet assuredly in fact and power his parting words--in which, endeavouring to give full crowning and harmonious close to all his thoughts, and to speak the sum of them by the imagined sentence of the Great Spirit, his strength and his heart fail him, and the words cease, broken off for ever. They are {{at the close of the}} dialogue called Critias, in which he describes, partly from real tradition, partly in ideal dream, the early state of Athens; and the genesis, and order, and religion, of the fabled isle of Atlantis; in which genesis he conceives the same first perfection and final degeneracy of man, which in our own Scriptural tradition is expressed by saying that the Sons of God inter-married with the daughters of men,[225] for he supposes the earliest race to have been indeed the children of God; and to have corrupted themselves, until [...] "their spot was not the spot of his children."[226] And this, he says, was the end; that indeed [...] "through many generations, so long as the God's nature in them yet was full, they were submissive to the sacred laws, and carried themselves lovingly to all that had kindred with them in divineness; for their uttermost spirit was faithful and true, and in every wise great; so that, in all meekness of wisdom, they dealt with each other, and took all the chances of life; and despising all things except virtue, they cared little what happened day by day, and bore lightly the burden of gold and of possessions; for they saw that, if only their common love and virtue increased, all these things would be increased together with them; but to set their esteem and ardent pursuit upon material possession would be to lose that first, and their virtue and affection together with it. And by such reasoning, and what of the divine nature remained in them, they gained all this greatness of which we have already told; but when the God's part of them faded and became extinct, being mixed again and again, and effaced by the prevalent mortality; and the human nature at last exceeded, they then became unable to endure the courses of fortune; and fell into shapelessness of life, and baseness in the sight of him who could see, having lost everything that was fairest of their honour; while to the blind hearts which could not discern the true life, tending to happiness, it seemed that they were then chiefly noble and happy, being filled with <b>an</b> iniquity of <b>inordinate</b> possession and power. Whereupon, the God of Gods, whose Kinghood is in laws, beholding a once just nation thus cast into misery, and desiring to lay such punishment upon them as might make them repent into restraining, gathered together all the gods into his dwelling-place, which from heaven's centre overlooks whatever has part in creation; and having assembled them, he said [...] "-- ...|$|R
