40|$|<b>ABSTRACT</b> <b>Money</b> is at {{the center}} of macroeconomics, which makes {{understanding}} the money supply central for macroeconomic theory. This paper presents the Post Keynesian theory of endogenous money supply and shows how it is fundamentally different from the conventional money supply theory. The conventional approach relies on the money multiplier and bank lending is invisible. Post Keynesian theory discards the money multiplier and focuses on bank lending which drives money creation. The paper emphasizes the structuralist version of Post Keynesian theory which retains Keynes&# 8217; liquidity preference theory of long term interest rates and also recognizes banks are subject to financial constraints that limit their lending activities. The paper then shows how to derive the LM schedule in an endogenous money economy, which is a necessary prelude to reconstructing the ISLM model...|$|E

Literatures on money and happiness, materialism, and cultural mediators are reviewed. Consumer well-being is associated with being neither very tight nor very loose with money, with having relatively low financial aspirations, and with being low in materialism. Price-related behaviors – whether to spend low, spend high, or attempt to maximize value – are ways of responding to economic outlay vis-à-vis material wants, and these “strategies ” offer a window into broader consumer lifestyles: the Value Seeker type is tight with money and materialistic; the Big Spender is loose with money and materialistic; the Non-Spender is tight with money and not materialistic; and the Experiencer is loose with money and not materialistic. Each of these types is described in terms of the potentials for well-being as well as the risks. Intrinsic motivation emerges as a key to well-being...|$|E

The improved economic condition {{of any country}} {{is a sign of}} increasing money demand and deteriorating economic climate is a sign of decreasing money demand (Maravic & Palic, 2005). In this study, Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach of co-integration developed by Pesaran et al., (2001) is used to estimate the money demand function. Real interest rate, GDP per capita, exchange rate, fiscal deficit, urban and rural population are selected to determine money demand function in Bangladesh over the period from 1975 - 2013. The co-integration analysis reveals that interest rate and per capita GDP exerts significant effect upon money demand both in long run and short run as well. Both urban and rural population have significant effect on money demand in the long run and short run and money demand function is found stable over time. Keywords.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the concepts of}} labour, life, and language among the Yami of Lanyu, Taiwan. In the local context, it is labour, life and language that comprise the concept of personhood among the Yami: tao, i. e. the ‘person’ in Yami language, is someone created labouring, and his labour in turn creates affluence, authority, and truth. I name this culturally particular image of a real or true person as Homo laboris or ‘Man the Worker’. This thesis aims to explore how labour, wealth, power, and knowledge are interrelated in Yami culture, and behind these relations, what material, social and epistemological conditions exist and render the relatedness possible. By analysing the contemporary economic predicament among the Yami, I attempt to highlight the effect of an episteme: when the Yami recognise and pursue wealth {{in the context of}} market economy they seem to be blind to the enormous invisible wealth in the market, because their category of wealth is constructed through numerous vis-à-vis relationships whose meaning resides in what a particular person is able to ‘see’. The concept of wealth is being re-categorised among the Yami, due to both their continuous trial and error in business management and the invincible power of <b>abstract</b> <b>money.</b> Accordingly, the straightforward relations between wealth, power, knowledge and labour are dissolving. The image of a real person is also changing now. In short, what money and commodities introduce to the Yami is not merely their use- or exchange- value but a set of new relations and a new way to see and recognise the world...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{academic disciplines}} of Philosophy and Economics {{by and large}} do not concern themselves with questions pertaining to the ontology of economic reality; by economic reality I mean the kinds of economic phenomena that people encounter on a daily basis, the central ones being economic transactions, money, prices, goods and services. Economic phenomena also include other aspects of economic reality such as economic agents, (including corporations, individual producers and consumers), commodity markets, banks, investments, jobs and production. My investigation of the ontology of economic phenomena begins with a critical examination of the accounts of theorists and philosophers from the past, including Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Marx, Simmel and Menger. Here I discuss various themes that have emerged from these writings, including the metallism-chartalism debates and whether economic value is an objective or subjective notion. Then I turn to contemporary philosophers, such as Searle, Bloor and Collin, who have used money as an example in their accounts of social phenomena.

40|$|<b>Abstract</b> — <b>Money</b> {{laundering}} evolves {{using multiple}} layers of trade, multi trading methods and uses multiple components in order to evade detection and prevention techniques. Consequently, detecting money laundering requires an analytical framework that can handle large amounts of unstructured, semistructured and transactional data that stream at transactional speeds to detect business-complexities, and discover deliberately concealed relationships. Based on our prior work and a static risk model proposed in the Bank Security Act, we propose a dynamic risk model that assigns a risk score for every transaction being a potential component of a larger money-laundering scheme. We use social networks to connect missing links in such potential transaction sequences. Taken together we can provide a financial sector independent risk assessment to submitted transactions. The proposed risk model is validated using data from realistic scenarios and our already developed money laundering evolution detection framework (MLEDF) that we developed earlier using sequence matching, case-based analysis, social networks, and complex event processing to link fraudulent transaction trails. MLEDF has components to collect data, run them against business rules and evolution models, run detection algorithms and use social network analysis to connect potential participants...|$|R

40|$|If we adopt a dialectical (Hegelian) {{reading of}} Marx’s theory of money, {{we can see}} that money {{contains}} within it the contradiction of commodity itself (between use-value and value) and in so doing, it contains different strata of contradiction that logically and historically have come to the fore. In this process, the truly social forms (for example money – as opposed to commodity, means of circulation – as opposed to measure of value, inconvertible money – as opposed to commodity money, and so on) seem to be stronger than their counterparts (social forms) and, because of this, there is a movement towards an autonomization of these forms. In this sense, value becomes autonomous from use-value; as medium of circulation, the <b>abstract</b> that <b>money</b> represents becomes autonomous from the concrete that the measure of value requires; as medium of payment, money becomes autonomous from the commodity circulation that has produced it, and so on. This paper aims to show that these movements may be behind some of the contemporary phenomena we are currently observing in the sphere of capital circulation (for example, the inconvertible US dollar acting as universal money, the “financialisation” of the valorization process, the spilling over of monetary crisis, bubbles and crashes, etc).

40|$|Though heavily criticized, the Kyoto Protocol {{has stood}} {{out as the}} key {{political}} tool in addressing climate change. However, {{one of the few}} instruments that allows industrialized and developing countries to cooperate towards mitigation of GHGs is CDM (Clean Development Mechanism). The underlying assumption of forestry CDM is that forest plantations (afforestation/ reforestation) might help remove carbon dioxide (the most representative GHG) emissions and compensate for the loss of natural forests. Therefore, this study focuses on this alleged trade-off. A bioeconomic analysis, which <b>abstracts</b> out <b>money</b> variables, is applied to assess carbon forest sequestration in Rio Grande do Sul. The state’s forest area is split up into natural and planted forests only. On one hand, this does not allow to check out for deforestation; on the other hand, such a phenomenon is not remarkable in Rio Grande do Sul. The land use is taken into account by a function that works as the emission removal demand. On the other hand, the emission supply function depends on the economic growth rates. The results show that, eventually, the sustainability of economic growth hinges on a region’s or country’s ecological situation – namely, equilibrium, credit or debt. The economic and environmental advantages of each mitigation strategy – CDM and natural forest conservation – are crosschecked. A nearly 40 -year-long overshoot rate is, after all, estimated for the forest sector in Rio Grande do Sul. The estimates suggest that CDM might help to relieve environmental stress only where ecological credit is reported. Where ecological debt is already on, CDM was found unable to compensate for conservation disregard. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> Many investors, <b>money</b> {{authority}} and reputable institutions closely follow credit default swaps while they regard them as reliable tool of measuring country credibility, since credit default swaps (CDS) come into prominence {{as an important}} indicator for country risks in recent years. Therefore, this phenomenon creates itself an area in academics, and examination of countries’ default spreads and determining the macroeconomic variables affecting them become an important academic area.   For these reasons, {{there are lots of}} researches have been made in this subject in Turkey and world recently. In this research, the macroeconomic variables, which affect country default swaps of developing countries, including Turkey, are determined and examined; moreover, the effects of chosen macroeconomic variables on country default swaps are analyzed. The subject of the research is not a static case, thus Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator method from dynamic panel data methods and Residual Linear Regression Model are used. According to the results of the analyses, it is found out that the selected variables which are (i) increase in current account balance, (ii) real interest rates, (iii) GDP growth rates, (iv) inflation rates and (v) annual positive changes in S&P Global Reit Index have important effects on CDS spreads.

The impact of borrowing on households can be severe, leading to indebtedness and further impoverishment. However, the available literature on borrowing practices for health is limited. We explore borrowing practices for paying for health care by the poor in Cambodia and provide a typology, associated conditions, {{and the extent of}} the phenomenon. Methods In addition to a semi-structured literature review, in-depth interviews were conducted with representatives of 47 households with health-related debt and 19 managers of formal or informal credit schemes. Results A large proportion of Cambodians, especially the poor, resort to borrowing to meet the cost of health care. Because of limited cash flow and access to formal creditors, the majority take out loans with high interest rates from informal money lenders. The most common type of informal credit is locally known as Changkar and consists of five kinds of loans: short-term loans, medium-term loans, seasonal loans, loans for an unspecified period, and loans with repayment in labour, each with different lending and repayment conditions and interest rates. Conclusion This study suggests the importance of informal credit for coping with the cost of treatment and its potentially negative impact on the livelihood of Cambodian people. We provide directions for further studies on financial protection interventions to mitigate harmful borrowing practices to pay for health care in Cambodia. </p...|$|R

However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the wishes of patients afflicted with these incurable tumours, and how this might influence treatment considerations. Methods We interviewed 29 individuals – 7 patients dying of a malignant brain tumor and 22 loved ones. One-on-one interviews were conducted according to a pre-designed interview guide. A combination of open-ended questions, as well as clinical scenarios was presented to participants in order to understand what is meaningful and valuable to them when determining treatment options and management approaches. The results were analyzed, coded, and interpreted using qualitative analytic techniques in order to arrive at several common overarching themes. Results Seven major themes were identified. In general, respondents were united in viewing brain cancer as unique amongst malignancies, due in large part to the premium placed on mental competence and cognitive functioning. Importantly, participants found their experiences, however difficult, led to the discovery of inner strength and resilience. Responses were usually framed within an interpersonal context, and participants were generally grateful for the opportunity to speak about their experiences. Attitudes towards religion, spirituality, and euthanasia were also probed. Conclusion Several important themes underlie the experiences of brain cancer patients and their caregivers. It is important to consider these when managing these patients and to respect not only their autonomy but also the complex interpersonal toll that a malignant diagnosis can have. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> Publicly created <b>money,</b> i. e. base money, costs {{much less}} to produce than privately created money because amongst other things private banks have {{to check up on}} the credit {{worthiness}} of borrowers before supplying them with money.   In contrast governments do not need to do those checks when creating and spending base money into the economy. It might be claimed that the cost of private money creation is the cost of organising loans and hence that the cost of private money creation as such is not particularly high. That claim does not stand inspection. Despite the high cost of private money, it nevertheless manages to drive public money to near extinction (except in the current very low interest scenario). Reason is that private banks can create and lend out money at below the going rate of interest because they are not burdened with one of the main costs normally involved in lending, namely earning money and abstaining from consumption (so that borrowers can consume.) When an economy is at capacity, the result of that extra lending is inflationary, so government has to withdraw base money from the economy, i. e. rob taxpayers,  in order to counteract the inflation, for example by cutting the deficit / raising the surplus or by raising interest rates. In short, private money printing is subsidised by taxpayers, and subsidies reduce GDP, unless there is a good reason for a subsidy. The net result of letting private money displace base money is an artificially low rate of interest and an artificially high level of debt, plus GDP is reduced. Thus GDP would be increased if privately issued money was banned, though its complete elimination is not necessary. Keywords. Money and interst rates, Money policy, Banking system, Government policy.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the changing dynamic {{in the relationship between}} the financial sector and the capitalist state. The thesis examines the changing form of this relationship in South Africa in the three decades that preceded the formation of the Government of National Unity in April 1994. Arguing that the political, ideological and economic forms expressed by the state are the surface appearances of deeper social processes arising from the production and reproduction of capitalist social relations, the thesis attempts to show how the contradictory tendencies of capital accumulation in South Africa increasingly took the form of a monetary crisis. In responding to the crisis after 1976, the apartheid state sought to depoliticise economic relations by restructuring the monetary basis of the state. The thesis analyses the proposals of the De Kock Commission appointed to inquire into the monetary system and monetary policy and shows how class struggle conditioned the attempt by the state to restructure the financial system. While the state pursued a legislative programme to restructure the financial system, deepening economic and political pressures, made it difficult to pursue such a programme in isolation from the pressures to restructure the relations of power and domination embodied in the apartheid state. The thesis traces the development of this contradiction {{during the course of the}} 1980 's and its resolution in the formation of the Government of National Unity in 1994. The restructuring of the state in the 1990 's and the emergence of a new popular government has made it possible to take the process of financial restructuring further. This is because the institutional restructuring of the 'post-apartheid' state has been confined within the liberal state form. The liberal state form allows the subordination of the state and civil society to the <b>abstract</b> rule of <b>money</b> and law. The thesis examines the implications for social relations of the continuity in the apartheid and post-apartheid forms of restructuring of the administrative, legal, fiscal, monetary and financial aparatuses...|$|R
40|$|Fiat money(1) is a {{creation}} of {{both the state and}} society. Its value is supported by expectations which are conditioned by the dynamics of trust in government, the socio-economic structure and by outside events such as wars, plagues or political unrest. The micro-management of a dynamic economy is not far removed in difficulty from the micro-management of the weather. However, money and the financial institutions and instruments of a modern economy provide the means to influence expectations and bound behavior. (2) Paper money emerges as a virtual commodity. The dynamics of the economy permits it to serve as an imaginary gold. Although it is an abstraction, it is meaningful to talk about its quantity. Closely related to but basically different from fiat money is credit. (3) Credit, unlike fiat money is not a virtual commodity but a two party contract. The fact that it is a two party contract set in a dynamic context implies that there are chances that the economy may reach a state where a debtor is unable to meet his or her obligations. When this happens the laws and customs of the society must provide default, bankruptcy and reorganization rules. These rules are usually denominated in terms of fiat and socio-economic penalties such as the confiscation of assets, garnishing of salary or time in debtors' prison. Thus the value of paper gold is determined in two ways by the dynamics of the system. First by acceptance in trade, based on the expectation that it will remain valuable and second by its role in the discharge of debts where failure to repay has unpleasant consequences. When taxes are present a third valuation appears in the penalties for failure to pay taxes. The control of the fiat money supply together with rules on the granting of credit and the bankruptcy, default and reorganization rules,in essence, provide lower and upper bounds for the price level in the economy. They also determine the innovation rate of the economy. An innovation may be regarded as an economic mutation; the less costly failure is, the more likely an innovation will be risked. The rates of interest for loans combined with the harshness of the bankruptcy and reorganization laws help to determine the rate of innovation in a society. Government controls only one among many interest rates. A host of institutional details involving risk and transactions cost determine the others. The velocity of both money and credit may vary. Even though velocity may vary, human decision-making takes a finite amount of time. This implies that velocity will remain bounded. Beyond some speed of circulation expectations will degenerate and the economy will break down. In order to appreciate the intrinsic dynamics of a high information and communication mass economy at least three agents must be distinguished. They are the highly visible government; other largely visible legal persons, such as banks and corporations and real persons. Their differences are characterized by their relative power and the size of their communication networks. The contrast between a market economy and a state economy is not a clean contrast. The distinctions are on a continuum. Among modern democratic market economies the size of the government sector is roughly anywhere from 15 % to 50 % of the economy. Thus the control description of virtually any modern economy is of one extremely large and visible player; at most a few hundred large corporate entities of reasonably high visibility and a mass of small agents known by and in direct communication with only a few others. The reconciliation of a dynamics oriented macro-economics with an equilibrium oriented micro-economics lies in the understanding that the economy is embedded in the polity and society. The institutions, customs and laws are the carriers of process and provide bounds to process. They limit the dynamics. The role of macroeconomic policy is to bound the dynamics of an evolving society. Individual behavior is local and necessarily myopic. Myopic local optimization is consistent with global evolution. An elementary understanding of history and the decision and game theory proliferation of strategies is enough to indicate that the search for a unique or even stationary economic dynamics is an essay in futility. In contrast the search for the correct carriers and bounds on process is feasible. The monetary structure provides the sufficient loose coupling to permit mass independent behavior to take place even somewhat chaotically within institutional bounds. (4) 1. I use the term fiat or <b>abstract</b> paper <b>money</b> interchangeably to stand for a government supplied means of payment of no intrinsic worth. 2. Phrasing this somewhat more technically they provide the bounds on the state space. A state space is the set of all feasible states which can be achieved by the system. 3. Credit such as bank credit from a well known bank may be referred to as "inside money" {{in the sense that it}} is a contract between two legal persons in the economy other than the government. Yet the bank credit, because of the visibility and reputation of the bank, may serve as a substitute in transactions for fiat money. 4. Technically the institutions and the monetary and financial structure fully define the state space, but do not describe the dynamics. There is a robust collection of local individual rules of behavior which are all sufficient to provide the dynamic support of expectations that money will be accepted as having value. The control system may be sufficient to guide or at least limit the overall macroeconomic behavior without necessarily providing for a precise or unique dynamics. Money is the only financial instrument without an offsetting instrument. This nonsymmetry appears to be critical in the introduction of time into the model of the economy.
