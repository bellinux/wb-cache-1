5|$|The shells {{are made}} of cast iron, as large as <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; {{and when they get}} there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting {{the contents of the}} bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains a labyrinth design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the Madonna and Child. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked {{the door to the}} garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> flask of wine.|$|E
5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter about the size of <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role {{as one of the most}} important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E

25|$|Family cemeteries with burials {{occurring}} {{in groups of}} 15 to 20 or more were found at some Nodena phase sites. Burials were in the extended position, lying on their backs, with most oriented on a north-south axis. The Nodena Phase people also left grave offerings for the afterlife with their deceased. Graves included <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> a bottle near {{the heads of the}} deceased, usually of the finer variety of effigy pottery. Sometimes tools were also included, as one woman's grave contained pottery making implements.|$|E
25|$|Bodhidharma {{settled in}} Northern Wei China. Shortly before his death, Bodhidharma {{appointed}} his disciple Dazu Huike to succeed him, making Huike the first Chinese-born ancestral founder {{and the second}} ancestral founder of Chan in China. Bodhidharma {{is said to have}} passed three items to Huike as a sign of transmission of the Dharma: a robe, <b>a</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> a copy of the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra. The transmission then passed to the second ancestral founder Dazu Huike, the third Sengcan, the fourth ancestral founder Dayi Daoxin, and the fifth ancestral founder Daman Hongren.|$|E
25|$|The {{find was}} taken to the farm where Maggie (later Mrs Nicholl) washed the items in a sink. At that time they did not realise they were made from gold. The hoard was {{eventually}} sold to the British Museum for six hundred pounds. It consisted of a miniature ship, complete with fittings and oars; two necklets, <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> a torc (or hollow collar). The find was described as a lump of mud when initially shown. Moreover, the boat had been so badly damaged by the plough that it took a goldsmith to later work out its structure.|$|E

He also took his only {{first-class}} wicket, in a match against New South Wales at the MCG. With the visitors chasing just 68 for victory in their fourth innings, Maddocks was allowed <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> dismissed opener Ron Briggs caught behind, by his brother and Test cricketer Len Maddocks. It was the only full season he would ever play but he also made some appearances in the 1955/56 and 1957/58 competitions.|$|E
25|$|For a yomeiri marriage, {{a man and}} {{his father}} would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman, {{including}} a sword, a treasured sword, an ornamental quiver, a sword guard, and a woven basket (hokai).

Bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in <b>a</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> other participants were entertained.|$|E
25|$|Most pottery {{found at}} the Nodena Site is of the kind known as Mississippian Bell Plain. It was buff colored, {{contains}} large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and isn't as smooth and polished as other varieties. Other kinds found there are much finer, with a finer ground shell as a temper, some instances being so finely ground as to look untempered. The Nodena Phase people put <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> a bottle into a grave with the bodies, usually of the finer variety of pottery. Shapes and decoration were varied in the mortuary pottery, from brighly colored abstract spiral designs, to elaborate effigy vessels depicting human heads, animals, and hunters and their prey. Pottery made by the Nodena people was built up from strips of clay, and then smoothed out by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area where the potters wheel was unknown. Slips using galena for white, hematite for red, and sometimes graphite for black were used to paint the pottery, with a red on white swastika design being particularly popular. Sometimes incising was used (an example is the incised raptor image on the effigy head pot pictured), although it is rare in Nodena pottery.|$|E
