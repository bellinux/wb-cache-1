I find great enjoyment in these situations. Once the time is up, the portrait becomes not just a painting in a collection, but a memory of personal time shared.|$|E
25|$|Recently my {{work with}} color has led me, {{in spite of}} myself, to search little by little, with some {{assistance}} (from the observer, from the translator), for the realization of matter, and I have decided to end the battle. My paintings are now invisible <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> show them in a clear and positive manner, in my next Parisian exhibition at Iris Clert's.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

Tadolini's qualities are far too good for that role! This may seem absurd to you!! ... Tadolini has a beautiful and attractive appearance; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> Lady Macbeth to be ugly and evil. Tadolini sings to perfection; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> the Lady not to sing. Tadolini has a stupendous voice, clear, limpid, powerful; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> the Lady to have a harsh, stifled, and hollow voice.

This {{is the first time}} an airline has moved directly from one alliance to another <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> thank all those involved in ensuring a smooth switch". At the time, it was rumored that the switch was Continental's first move in a planned United Airlines-Continental merge. Two months later, Brussels Airlines joined the alliance.|$|E
500|$|Shahid Kapoor {{was cast}} in the film's lead role. Several media outlets {{reported}} that Bhardwaj considered many actors before casting Kapoor in the role, which he refused. Bhardwaj refuted the claims, saying, [...] "There is a huge difference between discussing and narrating and offering someone a film <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> clear up the rumour by saying that Kaminey was never offered to anyone else and so no one rejected it." [...] Kapoor said that he accepted the role after reading the script. Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Sweety, the lead female role. She initially turned down the role, saying she {{felt it was a}} boys' film and her eight-scene part did not seem good enough. However, Bhardwaj persuaded her to accept the role.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} comfort women, he commented in 2007 that [...] "it {{is true that}} there were comfort women. I believe some parents may have sold their daughters.

[...] He claimed that there was a hoarseness in his voice and denied that he had been hungover. His version of this event was substantiated in 2017 by {{his interview}}er who stated that Cowen was weary and not drunk or hungover.|$|E

[...] (40 days and nights was {{the length of the}} Biblical Great Flood.) Jones responded, [...] "Mr. Gillen, that is an interesting coincidence, but it was not by design."

Smith stated his intent to cement his place in the Lancashire side as an all-rounder, saying that [...] "My batting has come on in leaps <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think of myself as more of an allrounder.
