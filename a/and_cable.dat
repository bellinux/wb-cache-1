50|$|Communicating {{data from}} one {{location}} to another requires {{some form of}} pathway or medium. These pathways, called communication channels, use two types of media: cable (twisted-pair wire, <b>cable,</b> <b>and</b> fiber-optic <b>cable)</b> <b>and</b> broadcast (microwave, satellite, radio, <b>and</b> infrared). <b>Cable</b> or wire line media use physical wires of cables to transmit data and information. Twisted-pair wire <b>and</b> coaxial <b>cables</b> are made of copper, <b>and</b> fiber-optic <b>cable</b> is made of glass.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire <b>and</b> <b>cable,</b> and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire <b>and</b> <b>cable</b> conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
