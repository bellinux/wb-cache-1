The pair took the idea to the BBC producer Leslie Bridgemont who was responsible for the show Merry-go-Round, which featured, in weekly rotation, shows based on the Army, Navy and RAF.

And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period for the rest of the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E

[...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett <b>always</b> <b>got</b> on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune." [...] They took turns to play the parts which had the [...] "good lines".

500|$|Julius Carry saw great {{potential}} {{in the character of}} Bowler. He had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of Bowler. Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real-life black deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves, in that [...] "Reeves <b>always</b> <b>got</b> his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in." [...] Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot Independence. He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching Army of Darkness. He later told Starlog, [...] "I saw that he would be very good with the physical stuff and that he could deliver a one-liner. I knew the situation would be good." [...] The original direction for Bowler was to have him constantly oppose Brisco, but as the series progressed the writers saw the good-natured chemistry between the actors and decided to make Brisco and Bowler a team. Bowler's race was never an issue in the show. [...] According to Cary Darling, a television critic, this attitude is different from serious Westerns and [...] "may hew more to the truth than one might think". [...] He said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare.|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones {{participated in}} school stage shows {{from a young}} age and gained local media {{attention}} when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre.

Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, [...] "I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again.
