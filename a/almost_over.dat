5|$|In the meantime, Asama {{remained}} on blockade duty off Port Arthur {{and participated in}} a minor way in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. She was coaling when the Pacific Squadron sortied and took some time to intercept the Russian ships. The battle was <b>almost</b> <b>over</b> by then and the ship only engaged them for the last hour {{or so of the}} battle. After the battle, the sisters were refitted and assigned to different units, escorting troop convoys to northern Korea and blockading the Tsugaru Strait until the Russian ships from the Baltic Fleet approached Japan in mid-1905.|$|E
5|$|The CLR {{bill was}} {{one of more than}} a dozen tube railway bills {{submitted}} to Parliament for the 1901 session, To review the bills on an equal basis, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor, but by the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was <b>almost</b> <b>over</b> and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Among the committee's recommendations were the withdrawal of the CLR's City loop, and that a quick, tube route from Hammersmith to the City of London would benefit London's commuters.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was <b>almost</b> <b>over</b> and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E

5|$|By 1 December the {{fighting}} for Jerusalem was <b>almost</b> <b>over.</b> The Ottoman Army {{had failed to}} win any ground {{as a result of}} their counterattacks, and the advancing British troops were successfully replacing their tired comrades who were well entrenched close to Jerusalem. On 2 December the relief of the XXI Corps by the XX Corps was completed when the 10th (Irish) Division relieved the 52nd (Lowland) Division. And each side began to adjust and improve their lines, leaving insecure or hard to defend places. The British increased the number of soldiers in their line to create a powerful concentration. Over four days the 10th (Irish) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions extended their positions, while the extended position held by the 60th (2/2nd London) Division was shortened.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, {{the failure}} of the French expeditionary force was the source of great frustration: Wolfe Tone, who was aboard Indomptable {{throughout}} the voyage, reported that he felt that he could have touched either side of the bay with both hands. Postponing the uprising, Tone continued to rally support in Europe, raising a fleet in the Netherlands for an attempted invasion that ended in destruction at the Battle of Camperdown. In May 1798, a British crackdown arrested the leaders of the United Irishmen in Ireland and provoked the Irish Rebellion. By the time the French had managed to gather a small force and reach Ireland in August, the rebellion was <b>almost</b> <b>over</b> and the inadequate French army, led by Jean Humbert, surrendered in September at the Battle of Ballinamuck. A subsequent invasion attempt the following month also ended in failure, when the invasion squadron was intercepted and defeated at the Battle of Tory Island. Wolfe Tone was captured at the action off Tory Island and committed suicide in prison. His death, combined with military defeat and reprisals against the Irish rebels, ended both the Society of United Irishmen and French invasion plans.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} French diversionary operations during 1806 was by a force that {{had been sent to}} sea in October 1805 as a diversion during the Trafalgar campaign, which by then was <b>almost</b> <b>over.</b> Sailing from Lorient to West Africa, L'Hermite {{was supposed to have been}} reinforced by a squadron under Jérôme Bonaparte and attack and capture British forts on the West African coast, thus forcing the detachment of British forces from the main campaign in pursuit. The events of the end of the Trafalgar campaign cancelled these plans, and the scheduled reinforcements were instead attached to Willaumez's squadron. Despite this setback, L'Hermite continued with elements of the original plan and attacked British merchant ships and slave ships off West Africa during the spring of 1806, inflicting some local damage but failing to capture a trading post or to affect the wider strategic situation. In June, L'Hermite sailed to Cayenne for supplies and then returned to Europe the following month, encountering part of the British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis on his return and losing the frigate Président.|$|E

5|$|The CCE's {{two bills}} were {{submitted}} to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the bills. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was <b>almost</b> <b>over</b> and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where it would provide an interchange with the existing MDR station (then called Charing Cross).|$|E
25|$|In 1368, {{when the}} truce was <b>almost</b> <b>over,</b> peace {{negotiations}} were started, but these led to nothing.

He was especially active in persuading MPs to back the parliamentary campaign.|$|E
25|$|Eventually the Indians {{returned}} to their designated reservations. Sheridan's department conducted the Red River War, the Ute War, and the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, {{which resulted in the}} death of a trusted subordinate, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The Indian raids subsided during the 1870s and were <b>almost</b> <b>over</b> by the early 1880s, as Sheridan became the commanding general of the U.S. Army.|$|E

He had previously, in 1907/08, played a Sheffield Shield match, where he didn't bowl yet batted {{far down the}} order at nine. His role this time was more clear and in his return match, against Victoria, he took 5-27 in their second innings and opening the batting in the first.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Johnston's trial had concluded, Bligh {{received}} a backdated promotion to rear admiral. In 1814 {{he was promoted}} again, to vice admiral of the blue.

He did, however, design the North Bull Wall {{at the mouth of the}} River Liffey in Dublin. Its purpose was to clear a sandbar by Venturi action. As a result of its building. North Bull Island was formed by the sand cleared by the river's now more narrowly focused force. Bligh also charted and mapped Dublin Bay.|$|E

25|$|He played {{regularly}} for Western Province in 1946-47 {{and in the}} match against Transvaal he hit 52 while opening the batting; {{this was to be}} his only first-class score of more than 50. On the strength of that and four catches in the Transvaal second innings, he was picked for the 1947 South African tour of England. With Johnny Lindsay and George Fullerton also in the touring side, Ovenstone's opportunities were limited. Lindsay was chosen for the first three Test matches and though his poor batting meant that he then lost his Test place, Ovenstone was not available, as he was sidelined for two months after breaking a finger in a county game immediately after the second Test; {{by the time he was}} fit again, the tour was <b>almost</b> <b>over</b> and Fullerton had taken over as the Test wicketkeeper.|$|E
25|$|An inquiry {{conducted}} {{at the behest of}} U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, stated the raid was justified by the available intelligence. The inquiry declared the elimination of the German ability to reinforce a counter-attack against Marshal Konev's extended line or, alternatively, to retreat and regroup using Dresden as a base of operations, were important military objectives. As Dresden had been largely untouched during the war due to its location, {{it was one of the}} few remaining functional rail and communications centres. A secondary objective was to disrupt the industrial use of Dresden for munitions manufacture, which American intelligence believed was the case. The shock to military planners and to the Allied civilian populations of the German counterattack known as the Battle of the Bulge had ended speculation that the war was <b>almost</b> <b>over,</b> and may have contributed to the decision to continue with the aerial bombardment of German cities.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April, during Joanita's {{short run}} of 15 performances, the {{management}} {{decided to change}} the name of the company to Théâtre Lyrique. As attendance was falling rapidly, Joanita was replaced with La pie voleuse, a Castil-Blaze adaptation of Rossini's La gazza ladra, on 23 April. However, they only performed it seven times, as the season was <b>almost</b> <b>over.</b> The season had run from late September to the end of April, a pattern repeated in later seasons, which usually ran from September or early October to May, or sometimes even into the summer. Jules Seveste sought a state subsidy of 50,000 francs for the following year, but it was too late; the budget had already been finalized. In addition, the conductor Alphonse Varney resigned his position and went to Ghent so he would have more time for composition. He was replaced by his assistant conductor, Auguste Francis Placet, and the violinist Adolphe Deloffre, who had recently returned to Paris from London, was made assistant conductor.|$|E
