5000|$|The {{three species}} of kākāriki or New Zealand parakeets {{are the most}} common species of parakeets in the genus Cyanoramphus, family Psittacidae. The birds' Māori name, which is the most {{commonly}} used, means [...] "small parrot". The etymology is: from kākā, parrot + riki, small. [...] The word is also used to refer to the colour green because of the birds' predominantly green plumage. The patches of red on the birds' rumps are, according to legend, the blood of the demigod Tāwhaki.The three species on mainland New Zealand are the yellow-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus auriceps), the red-crowned parakeet, or red-fronted parakeet (C. novaezelandiae), and the critically endangered Malherbe's parakeet or orange-fronted parakeet (not to be confused with Aratinga canicularis a popular <b>aviary</b> <b>bird</b> known as the orange-fronted conure, orange-fronted parakeet or half-moon conure - C. malherbi).|$|E
50|$|During the nesting season {{males are}} highly territorial, chasing away any {{potential}} intruders or threats. Individuals {{are considered to}} be monogamous, staying with a single partner. This species is known to be nomadic following water and food sources. In the wild the Bourke’s parrot tends to live in pairs or small groups but often live in large flocks ranging in the hundred during times of drought. Due to their diet the Bourke’s parrot works as a known seed disperser. The Bourke’s parrot is a popular <b>aviary</b> <b>bird.</b> Due to their peaceful nature Bourke’s parrot may be kept in captivity with a number of other species including finches, doves and other small parakeet species, however it is suggested that only one pair of Bourke’s parrots are kept in a single aviary due to the males being territorial during breeding season.|$|E
