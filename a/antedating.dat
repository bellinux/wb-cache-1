5|$|Husbandry {{has a long}} history, {{starting}} with the Neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, <b>antedating</b> farming of the first crops. By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were being raised on farms. Major changes {{took place in the}} Columbian Exchange when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as Robert Bakewell to yield more meat, milk, and wool. A wide range of other species such as horse, water buffalo, llama, rabbit and guinea pig are used as livestock {{in some parts of the}} world. Aquaculture of fish, molluscs, and crustaceans, and the keeping of bees and silkworms is widespread. Insects for human consumption are raised in several countries; for example, the production of crickets is a profitable industry in Thailand.|$|E

The Theravāda Abhidharma, the Abhidhamma Pitaka (discussed below), is preserved in Pāli, while the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma is mostly preserved only in Chinese - the (likely Sanskrit) original texts having been lost, though some Tibetan texts are still extant. A small number of other Abhidharma texts of unknown origin are preserved in translation in the Chinese canon. These different traditions have some similarities, suggesting either interaction between groups or some common ground <b>antedating</b> the separation of the schools.|$|E

25|$|With {{the history}} of many neighbourhoods of the city such as Mylapore and Triplicane <b>antedating</b> that of the city, the {{architecture}} of Chennai ranges in a wide chronology. The oldest buildings in the city dates from the 7th and 8th centuries CE, which include the Kapaleeshwarar Temple in Mylapore and the Parthasarathy Temple in Triplicane, built in the Dravidian architecture. This architecture includes various styles, {{such as those of}} the Pallavas, the Cholas, and the Vijayanagara empires. The associated Agraharam architecture, which consists of traditional row houses surrounding a temple, can still be seen in these areas. The heritage temples at Mamallapuram at {{the outskirts of the city}} are some of the examples of the Pallava architecture. Chennai ranks second to Kolkata of Indian heritage buildings.|$|E

The colourful Bonampak murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending {{over the walls}} and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, {{as well as a}} group of ritual impersonators {{in the midst of a}} file of musicians. At San Bartolo, murals dating from 100 BC relate to the myths of the Maya maize god and the hero twin Hunahpu, and depict a double inthronization; <b>antedating</b> the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul. Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican Cacaxtla, murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by the Maya merchant deity.|$|E

Two combined takes of Keith Relf's vocal, with some differences in the lyrics, come in after twelve bars.
