5|$|As of May 12, 2017, {{there have}} been 200 spacewalks devoted to {{assembly}} and maintenance of the International Space Station totaling 1247 hours and 55 minutes. As of March 2, 2011, a total time of 973 hours and fifty-three minutes has been spent in extra-vehicular activity (EVA), with 127 of these EVAs performed from station <b>airlocks,</b> totaling 787 hours and twenty-eight minutes in spacewalk time from the station itself. Twenty-eight spacewalks have been performed from a shuttle, ninety-three from the Quest Joint Airlock, thirty-two from the Pirs docking compartment, and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the Zvezda Service Module.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{enter and}} leave through <b>airlocks</b> (sometimes {{including}} an air shower stage), and wear protective clothing such as hoods, face masks, gloves, boots, and coveralls.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the {{mean free path}} of the electron gas interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically {{on the order of}} 10−4 Pa. The need for this is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the collision frequency of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels—this effect is characterized by the mean free path. TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and <b>airlocks</b> and are not permanently vacuum sealed.|$|E
50|$|An <b>airlock</b> {{may also}} be used {{underwater}} to allow passage between an air environment in a pressure vessel and the water environment outside, {{in which case the}} <b>airlock</b> can contain air or water. This is called a floodable <b>airlock</b> or an underwater <b>airlock,</b> and is used to prevent water from entering a submersible vessel or an underwater habitat.|$|R
50|$|Rotary <b>airlock</b> feeders/ rotary <b>airlock</b> valves {{are used}} in {{pneumatic}} conveying systems, dust control equipment, and as volumetric feed-controls.|$|R
50|$|The Quest Joint <b>Airlock,</b> {{previously}} {{known as}} the Joint <b>Airlock</b> Module, is the primary <b>airlock</b> for the International Space Station. Quest was designed to host spacewalks with both Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuits and Orlan space suits. The <b>airlock</b> was launched on STS-104 on July 14, 2001. Before Quest was attached, Russian spacewalks using Orlan suits could only be done from the Zvezda service module, and American spacewalks using EMUs were only possible when a Space Shuttle was docked. The arrival of Pirs docking compartment on September 16, 2001 provided another <b>airlock</b> from which Orlan spacewalks can be conducted.|$|R
25|$|The Times of July 7, 1905 {{records that}} at 9am on July 7, divers reached the Farfadet {{and found that}} the crew were {{responding}} to knocks. Four hawser (steel) cables were wrapped around the submarine in preparation for the arrival of a 20-ton pontoon and crane, belonging to the Hersen Company. At 3.20pm the vessel was raised, its aft portion breaking the water so that <b>airlocks</b> could be opened and the air inside renewed for the surviving crew. Attempts were then made to ground the submarine in shallow water, but at 12.45 the next morning the crane broke, sending the submarine back {{to the bottom of the}} harbour. Further efforts to recover it, involving the French steamer Audax, were in vain.|$|E
25|$|TEM {{specimen}} stage designs include <b>airlocks</b> {{to allow for}} insertion of the specimen holder into the vacuum with minimal loss of vacuum {{in other areas of}} the microscope. The specimen holders hold a standard size of sample grid or self-supporting specimen. Standard TEM grid sizes are 3.05mm diameter, with a thickness and mesh size ranging from a few to 100μm. The sample is placed onto the meshed area having a diameter of approximately 2.5mm. Usual grid materials are copper, molybdenum, gold or platinum. This grid is placed into the sample holder, which is paired with the {{specimen stage}}. A wide variety of designs of stages and holders exist, depending upon the type of experiment being performed. In addition to 3.05mm grids, 2.3mm grids are sometimes, if rarely, used. These grids were particularly used in the mineral sciences where a large degree of tilt can be required and where specimen material may be extremely rare. Electron transparent specimens have a thickness usually less than 100nm, but this value depends on the accelerating voltage.|$|E
25|$|Icarus II docks with Icarus I. Capa, Searle, Mace, {{and former}} {{communications}} officer now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board Icarus II. They discover Icarus Is mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of Icarus I is found charred {{to death in}} the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the un-shielded sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus Is outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. Mace suggests one crew member stay behind to manually operate the airlock while the other three jettison between <b>airlocks,</b> using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle volunteers to stay behind. Capa is sealed in the only space suit, while Harvey and Mace wrap themselves in salvaged insulation material. Searle releases the airlock and the three crew members rocket into space. Harvey misses the airlock and freezes to death, while Capa and Mace make it back to Icarus II. Searle, having spent the mission obsessed with looking into the shielded sun, voluntarily exposes himself to its full, deadly force in the observation room.|$|E
50|$|The fabric <b>airlock</b> tube {{was made}} rigid by about 40 airbooms, {{clustered}} as three, independent groups. Two groups sufficed for deployment. The airbooms needed seven minutes to fully inflate. Four spherical tanks held sufficient oxygen to inflate the airbooms and pressurize the <b>airlock.</b> Two lights lit the <b>airlock</b> interior, and three 16mm cameras — {{two in the}} <b>airlock,</b> one outside on a boom mounted to the upper ring — recorded the historic first spacewalk.|$|R
50|$|NanoRacks, via its Space Act Agreement with NASA, {{deployed}} a CubeSat via the J-SSOD. Seeing {{the emerging}} market demand for CubeSats, NanoRacks self-funded its own ISS deployer, {{with the permission}} of both NASA and JAXA. NanoRacks evolved away from the J-SSOD due to the small number of satellites that could be deployed in one <b>airlock</b> cycle and their desire to maximize the capacity of each <b>airlock</b> cycle. The J-SSOD used a full <b>airlock</b> cycle to only launch 6U. The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer uses two <b>airlock</b> cycles, each holding eight deployers. Each deployer is capable of holding 6U, allowing for a total of 48U per <b>airlock</b> cycle.|$|R
50|$|The {{unmanned}} craft {{was launched}} {{three weeks before}} Voskhod 2. The primary objective of Voskhod 2 was to conduct a spacewalk, which relied on the inflatable Volga <b>airlock.</b> Kosmos 57 was to test {{the performance of the}} <b>airlock.</b> The <b>airlock</b> opened and closed successfully and the craft was re-pressurized without flaw.|$|R
500|$|To further {{expand its}} {{scientific}} capabilities, Salyut 6 {{was equipped with}} 20 portholes for observations, two scientific <b>airlocks</b> to expose equipment to space or eject rubbish, and various pieces of apparatus to carry out biological experiments. Later on during the flight, a Progress spacecraft delivered an external telescope, the KRT-10 radio observatory (...) , which incorporated a directional antenna and five radiometers. The antenna was deployed on the rear docking assembly, with the controller remaining inside the station, and was used for both astronomical and meteorological observations.|$|E
2500|$|As with BSL-3 {{laboratories}}, BSL-4 laboratories must {{be separated}} from areas that receive unrestricted traffic. Additionally airflow is tightly controlled to ensure that air always flows from [...] "clean" [...] areas of the lab to areas where work with infectious agents is being performed. The entrance to the BSL-4 lab must also employ <b>airlocks</b> to minimize the possibility that aerosols from the lab could {{be removed from the}} lab. All laboratory waste, including filtered air, water, and trash must also be decontaminated before it can leave the facility.|$|E
2500|$|Pirs ( [...] , meaning [...] "pier"), (...) , [...] "docking module", SO-1 or DC-1 (docking compartment), and Poisk ( [...] ; lit. Search), {{also known}} as the Mini-Research Module 2 (MRM 2), , or МИМ 2. Pirs and Poisk are Russian airlock modules, each having 2 {{identical}} hatches. An outward-opening hatch on the Mir space station failed after it swung open too fast after unlatching, because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock. A different entry was used, and the hatch was repaired. All EVA hatches on the ISS open inwards and are pressure-sealing. Pirs was used to store, service, and refurbish Russian Orlan suits and provided contingency entry for crew using the slightly bulkier American suits. The outermost docking ports on both <b>airlocks</b> allow docking of Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, and the automatic transfer of propellants to and from storage on the ROS.|$|E
50|$|The Joint <b>Airlock</b> is 20 ft (6.1 m) long, 13 ft (4.0 m) in {{diameter}} and weighs 6.5 short tons (5.9 metric tons). It was built at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) by the Space Station Prime Contractor Boeing. The ISS-airlock has two main components: a crew <b>airlock</b> and an equipment <b>airlock</b> for storing EVA gear and EVA preflight preps. STS-104 also carries a spacelab pallet with four High Pressure Gas Assembly containers that were attached to {{the exterior of the}} <b>airlock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the flight was to deliver and install the Quest <b>airlock.</b> The Joint <b>Airlock</b> is a {{pressurized}} flight element consisting of two cylindrical chambers attached end-to-end by a connecting bulkhead and hatch. Once installed and activated, the ISS <b>airlock</b> became the primary path for International Space Station space walk entry and departure for U.S. spacesuits, which are known as Extravehicular Mobility Units, or EMUs. In addition, the Joint <b>Airlock</b> is designed to support the Russian Orlan spacesuit for EVA activity.|$|R
50|$|Beverage industry:Intelligent <b>airlock</b> {{solutions}} can {{be achieved}} by means of high-speed doors. Two doors with highly transparent laths gives a clear view throughout. Pressure and temperature differences can easily be controlled by an <b>airlock</b> where the transporter enters the <b>airlock,</b> and the one door cannot be operated before the other has closed. This is also used in security applications.|$|R
2500|$|The {{assembly}} of the International Space Station, a major endeavour in space architecture, began in November 1998. Russian modules launched and docked robotically, {{with the exception of}} Rassvet. All other modules were delivered by the Space Shuttle, which required installation by ISS and shuttle crewmembers using the Canadarm2 (SSRMS) and extra-vehicular activities (EVAs); , they had added 159 components during more than 1,000 hours of EVA (see List of ISS spacewalks). 127 of these spacewalks originated from the station, and the remaining 32 were launched from the <b>airlocks</b> of docked Space Shuttles. The beta angle of the station had to be considered at all times during construction, as it directly affects how long during its orbit the station (and any docked or docking spacecraft) is exposed to the sun; the Space Shuttle would not perform optimally above a limit called the [...] "beta cutoff". Many of the modules that launched on the Space Shuttle were integrated and tested on the ground at the Space Station Processing Facility to find and correct issues prior to launch.|$|E
2500|$|During normal operation, the {{containment}} is air-tight and access is only through marine style <b>airlocks.</b> High air temperature and {{radiation from the}} core limit the time, measured in minutes, people can spend inside containment while the plant is operating at full power. In {{the event of a}} worst-case emergency, called a [...] "design basis accident" [...] in NRC regulations, {{the containment}} is designed to seal off and contain a meltdown. Redundant systems are installed to prevent a meltdown, but as a matter of policy, one is assumed to occur and thus the requirement for a containment building. For design purposes, the reactor vessel's piping is assumed to be breached, causing a [...] "LOCA" [...] (loss Of coolant accident) where the water in the reactor vessel is released to the atmosphere inside the containment and flashes into steam. The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to turn on to condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs. The safety systems close non-essential lines into the air-tight containment by shutting the isolation valves. Emergency Core Cooling Systems are quickly turned on to cool the fuel and prevent it from melting. The exact sequence of events depends on the reactor design.|$|E
50|$|In Star Trek, Star Wars {{and some}} other genres of fiction, {{conventional}} <b>airlocks</b> may be replaced by forcefields which hold in air while allowing solid matter like spacecraft to pass through. <b>Airlocks</b> of this type usually have pressure doors as a backup.|$|E
40|$|The Orbiter <b>Airlock</b> Support Subsystem (ALSS) is {{designed}} to provide shirtsleeve intervehicular transfer (IVA) between the orbiter and payload spacelab. Also, the <b>airlock</b> provides for extravehicular transfer (EVA) of two crewman to space and/or unpressurized payload from a pressurized cabin environment. The orbiter <b>airlock</b> design permits three planned EVA's for periods up to 6 hr. The <b>airlock</b> {{is designed}} to be interchangeable in three different locations, in the crew cabin, attached to the cabin aft bulkhead or attached to transfer tunnel adapter both which are located in the cargo bay. The Orbiter <b>Airlock</b> Support Subsystem described herein provides ventilation, pressurization, depressurization, prebreathing, personnel oxygen system supply (POS), and Extravehicular Mobility Unit support (EMU). This paper defines the system configuration for each <b>airlock</b> location and the commonality between them. Emphasis is also placed on the design data used to define repressurization and depressurization requirements, ventilation, water cooling, wastewater discharge, flow rates, and valve sizing...|$|R
5000|$|Belyayev then {{deployed}} and pressurized the Volga inflatable <b>airlock.</b> The <b>airlock</b> {{was necessary}} for two reasons: first, the capsule's avionics used vacuum tubes, which required a constant atmosphere for air cooling. Also, supplies of nitrogen and oxygen sufficient to replenish the atmosphere after EVA could not be carried due to the spacecraft's weight limit. By contrast, the American Gemini capsule used solid state avionics, and an atmosphere of oxygen only, at a low pressure of , which could easily be replenished after EVA. The Volga <b>airlock</b> was designed, built, and tested in nine months in mid-1964. At launch, Volga fitted over Voskhod 2's hatch, extending 74 cm beyond the spacecraft's hull. The <b>airlock</b> comprised a 1.2 m wide metal ring fitted over Voskhod 2's inward-opening hatch, a double-walled fabric <b>airlock</b> tube with a deployed length of 2.50 m, and a 1.2 m wide metal upper ring around the 65 cm wide inward-opening <b>airlock</b> hatch. Volga's deployed internal volume was [...]|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the need and}} solution for minimizing EVA <b>airlock</b> time and depress gas losses using a new method that minimizes EVA out-the-door time for a suited astronaut and reclaims most of the <b>airlock</b> depress gas. This method consists {{of one or more}} related concepts that use an evacuated reservoir tank to store and reclaim the <b>airlock</b> depress gas. The evacuated tank can be an inflatable tank, a spent fuel tank from a lunar lander descent stage, or a backup <b>airlock.</b> During EVA <b>airlock</b> operations, the <b>airlock</b> and reservoir would be equalized at some low pressure, and through proper selection of reservoir size, most of the depress gas would be stored in the reservoir for later reclamation. The benefit of this method is directly applicable to long duration lunar and Mars missions that require multiple EVA missions (up to 100, two-person lunar EVAs) and conservation of consumables, including depress pump power and depress gas. The current ISS <b>airlock</b> gas reclamation method requires approximately 45 minutes of the astronaut s time in the <b>airlock</b> and 1 KW in electrical power. The proposed method would decrease the astronaut s time in the <b>airlock</b> because the depress gas is being temporarily stored in a reservoir tank for later recovery. Once the EVA crew is conducting the EVA, the volume in the reservoir would be pumped back to the cabin at a slow rate. Various trades were conducted to optimize this method, which include time to equalize the <b>airlock</b> with the evacuated reservoir versus reservoir size, pump power to reclaim depress gas versus time allotted, inflatable reservoir pros and cons (weight, volume, complexity), and feasibility of spent lunar nitrogen and oxygen tanks as reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|Four {{concepts}} for on-orbit spacesuit donning, doffing, servicing, check-out, egress and ingress are presented. These are: the Space Transportation System (STS) Type (shuttle system enlarged), the Transit <b>Airlock</b> (Shuttle <b>Airlock</b> with suit servicing {{removed from}} the pump-down chamber), the Suitport (a rear-entry suit mates to a port in the <b>airlock</b> wall), and the Crewlock (a small, individual, conformal <b>airlock).</b> Each of these four concepts is compared {{through a series of}} seven steps representing a typical Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) mission: (1) Predonning suit preparation; (2) Portable Life Support System (PLSS) preparation; (3) Suit Donning and Final Check; (4) Egress/Ingress; (5) Mid-EVA rest period; (6) Post-EVA Securing; (7) Non-Routine Maintenance. The different characteristics of each concept are articulated through this step-by-step approach. Recommendations concerning an approach for further evaluations of <b>airlock</b> geometry, anthropometrics, ergonomics, and functional efficiency are made. The key recommendation is that before any particular <b>airlock</b> can be designed, the full range of spacesuit servicing functions must be considered, including timelines that are most supportive of EVA human productivity...|$|R

40|$|During International Space Station campout {{protocol}} ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) preparations, {{the crew}} is isolated overnight in the small <b>airlock</b> volume in a reduced pressure, oxygen enriched atmosphere. As such, there are special considerations for the software in terms of air composition, pressure control and emergency responses.
