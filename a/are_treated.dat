Once diagnosed, people with BHD <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging.

40|$|Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease {{caused by}} the {{arbovirus}} which {{is a member of}} the Nairovirus genus and has a high mortality rate if the patients don`t take treatment. This study was conducted to detect the clinical outcomes of treatment with oral ribavirin in children with CCHF. In this study, we evaluated the recovery rate and mortality rate among children with confirmed CCHF, who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> with oral ribaririn within the three days of onset of disease and the patients who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after this time or had not <b>been</b> <b>treated.</b> Out of 29 children with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (18 Male, 11 Female with age range 5 to 17 years) 25 patients had <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> by oral ribavirin within the initial three days, two patients <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after three days of the onset of disease and two cases had not <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with ribavin. Nearly all the patients except two children <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> with ribavirin. Both these two children not treated with ribavirin died. One patients who <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> six days after the onset of disease was expired. Sixteen percent of children who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> during the initial 72 h of disease died. Fatality rate was 24. 1 % in all of the patients. The recovery rate was higher in the children who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> during the initial 3 days than children who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after this time or <b>were</b> not <b>treated</b> (84 versus 25 %). We conclude that oral ribavirin is an effective treatment for children with CCHF, especially when it is used within 72 h of the onset of disease and as soon as it is possible...|$|R

5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality.

Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it.
