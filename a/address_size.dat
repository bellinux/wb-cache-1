50|$|On the {{original}} models the <b>address</b> <b>size</b> was 15 bits, allowing up to 32Kwords of memory. Later models added 22 bit addressing, allowing a theoretical 4Mword maximum memory.

40|$|Despite {{efforts to}} discern the role of plant size in {{resource}} competition, {{the circumstances under which}} size-dependent plant-plant interactions occur are still unclear. The traditional assumption is that competition intensifies with increasing neighbour size. However, recent studies suggest that the size (biomass) dependence of competitive interactions is strongest at very low biomass levels and becomes negligible after a certain threshold neighbour biomass has been reached. We searched for the generality of such patterns for three common annual plant species in Israel. We monitored target and neighbour biomass along their entire lifecycle using an even-aged, intraspecific and intrapopulation competition screenhouse experiment under water-limited conditions. For all focal species, neighbour presence had a net negative effect on vegetative biomass at harvest. However, this was not explained by increasing neighbour biomass over time, as a consistent pattern of size-dependent facilitative, rather than competitive, interactions was observed at all life stages. We explain these observations in terms of co-occurring aboveground facilitation and dominant belowground competition for water. Since our findings are the first of their kind and contradict theoretical predictions of biomass dependence of net negative interactions, we advocate further experiments <b>addressing</b> <b>size</b> dependence in interactions among plants. In particular, theoretical models <b>addressing</b> <b>size</b> dependence of positive interactions must be developed...|$|R
50|$|The Address Resolution Protocol uses {{a simple}} message format {{containing}} one address resolution request or response. The {{size of the}} ARP message depends on the upper layer and lower layer <b>address</b> <b>sizes,</b> which are given {{by the type of}} networking protocol (usually IPv4) in use and the type of hardware or virtual link layer that the upper layer protocol is running on. The message header specifies these types, as well as the <b>size</b> of <b>addresses</b> of each. The message header is completed with the operation code for request (1) and reply (2). The payload of the packet consists of four addresses, the hardware and protocol address of the sender and receiver hosts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{combination}} of architectural innovations proved superior to competitors and the [...] "11" [...] architecture was soon the industry leader, propelling DEC {{back to a}} strong market position. The design was later expanded to allow paged physical memory and memory protection features, useful for multitasking and time-sharing. Some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual <b>address</b> <b>size</b> of 128 kB within a physical <b>address</b> <b>size</b> of up to 4 MB.

30|$|The semideciduous forest {{ecosystem}} within the Atlantic Forest extends along {{the central and}} southeast regions of Brazil’s interior.

40|$|Hybrid Electric Vehicles {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} both in civil and military applications {{due to their}} promising advantages in achieving better fuel economy and reduced pollutant emissions {{when compared to the}} conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. However, the advantages gained in vehicle electrification do have different significance and requirement in the Army than the commercial ones. In this paper, the payoffs of range extended electric vehicles are discussed. The fuel economy, silent watch, silent mobility, gradeability and thermal signature of vehicles are highly dependent on the load carried, role, duty cycle and the proper sizing of the drive-train components.

5000|$|The largest {{configured}} S/36 {{could support}} 7MB of RAM and 1478MB of disk space. This cost over US$200,000 {{back in the}} early 1980s.

50|$|The {{virtual memory}} systems have three <b>sizes,</b> with <b>addresses</b> <b>sized</b> 32, 39 and 48-bits.

To optionally {{reduce the cost of}} page table walks, super-sized pages may be leaf pages in higher levels of a system's page table tree. SV32 has a two layer page table tree and supports 4MiB superpages. SV39 has a three level page table, and supports 2MiB superpages and 1GiB gigapages. SV48 is required to support SV39.

5000|$|The {{threat of}} {{exhaustion}} motivated {{the introduction of}} a number of remedial technologies, such as classful networks, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) methods, network address translation (NAT) and strict usage-based allocation policies.

5000|$|The {{accepted}} and standard long term {{solution is to}} use IPv6 which increased the <b>address</b> <b>size</b> to 128 bits, providing a vastly increased address space that also allows improved route aggregation across the Internet and offers large subnetwork allocations of a minimum of 264 host addresses to end-users.

40|$|Agency size is {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} positively correlated with survival: the bigger an agency, the less likely {{it is to be}} terminated. Yet, recent research finds a very small effect of size on survival. The reason, we argue, is that it only <b>addresses</b> <b>size</b> in terms of overall operating budget – what this article calls objective size. By contrast, we use an interpretive historicist approach to show how perceived size – the meanings and beliefs of key actors concerning an agency's size – affects termination. Drawing on a case study of Australia's independent aid agency, AusAID, which endured a tumultuous history of cuts, reorganizations and rebirths, culminating in termination, we show how perceptions of the agency's size mattered. These findings both support and extend recent research showing that adaptation and reputation are critical to the survival of government agencies. No Full Tex...|$|R
