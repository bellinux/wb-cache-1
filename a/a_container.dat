5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In <b>a</b> <b>container</b> with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. <b>A</b> <b>container</b> wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in <b>a</b> <b>container,</b> then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of <b>a</b> <b>container.</b> And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E
5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from <b>a</b> <b>container,</b> a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> Portlet <b>container</b> runs portlets and {{provides}} them with the required runtime environment. <b>A</b> portlet <b>container</b> contains portlets and manages their life cycles. It also provides persistent storage mechanisms for the portlet preferences. <b>A</b> portlet <b>container</b> receives requests from the portal to execute requests on the portlets hosted by it. <b>A</b> portlet <b>container</b> is not responsible for aggregating the content produced by the portlets; the portal itself handles aggregation. A portal and <b>a</b> portlet <b>container</b> can be built together as a single component of an application suite or as two separate components of a portal application.|$|R

5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as <b>a</b> <b>container</b> plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to <b>a</b> <b>container</b> of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws <b>a</b> <b>container</b> of makeup powder spray in the air and smears <b>a</b> <b>container</b> of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

5|$|Xenon gas can {{be safely}} kept in normal sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from <b>a</b> <b>container</b> sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to {{a select group of}} substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in <b>a</b> <b>container,</b> and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E

5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over <b>a</b> <b>container</b> of Epsom salts {{into the tub}} where the {{unconscious}} Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in the tub with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as <b>a</b> <b>container,</b> rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E

When {{thirteen}} unidentified young women are found dead in <b>a</b> <b>container</b> at the docks, McNulty successfully makes a spiteful effort to place the murders within the jurisdiction of his former commander. Meanwhile, police Major Stan Valchek gets into a feud with Polish-American Frank Sobotka, {{a leader of the}} International Brotherhood of Stevedores, a fictional dockers' union, over competing donations to their old neighborhood church. Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka. Cedric Daniels is interviewed, having been praised by Prez, Major Valchek's son-in-law, and also because of his work on the Barksdale case. He is eventually selected to lead the detail assigned just to investigate Sobotka; when the investigation is concluded Daniels is assured he will move up to head a special case unit with personnel of his choosing.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposition}} of Rodrigo's body became {{a subject of}} dispute. A possible cremation and transport of the ashes to the Córdoba province was denied by judicial authorities in case a future autopsy was needed. The idea of a burial at the Lanús Municipal Cemetery was rejected by his mother due to concerns about vandalism. Instead, she decided to place the body in Las Praderas Cemetery in Monte Grande. Since the investigation into Bueno's death was still open and further tests might be performed, his body was placed in <b>a</b> <b>container</b> by the Justice Ministry. In 2005, five years after his death, the case was closed and the burial was authorized. The body {{was placed in a}} marble mausoleum. His mother, manager and friends attended a memorial service where they placed a trophy over the marble grave, symbolizing the appreciation of his relatives, fans and friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{purposes}} of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise {{of effort and}} ingenuity (for the grower). Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping {{of one or more}} small trees growing in <b>a</b> <b>container,</b> beginning with a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or hornbeam.|$|E
