5|$|In {{contrast}} to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green <b>archaeoastronomy,</b> Brown <b>archaeoastronomy</b> {{has been identified as}} being closer to the history of astronomy or to cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown <b>archaeoastronomy</b> is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Green <b>Archaeoastronomy</b> {{is named}} after {{the cover of the}} book <b>Archaeoastronomy</b> in the Old World. It is based {{primarily}} on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.|$|E
5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice <b>archaeoastronomy.</b> Despite this it is accepted that <b>archaeoastronomy</b> is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because <b>archaeoastronomy</b> is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>archaeoastronomy</b> {{is about}} the many and various ways people interacted with the sky, there are a diverse range of sources giving {{information}} about astronomical practices.|$|E
5|$|Clive Ruggles and Michel Cotte {{recently}} edited {{a book on}} heritage {{sites of}} astronomy and <b>archaeoastronomy</b> that provides {{a list of the}} main sites around the world.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do <b>Archaeoastronomy.</b> The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of <b>archaeoastronomy</b> in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaeoastronomy</b> is {{sometimes}} {{related to the}} fringe discipline of Archaeocryptography, when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions, size, and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of Kukulcán at Chichen Itza.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaeoastronomy</b> uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. <b>Archaeoastronomy</b> fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia <b>archaeoastronomy</b> has developed from the History of Astronomy and much <b>archaeoastronomy</b> is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
5|$|A common {{source of}} data for <b>archaeoastronomy</b> {{is the study of}} alignments. This is based on the {{assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. <b>Archaeoastronomy</b> {{is the study}} of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology {{is the study of}} the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E
5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate <b>archaeoastronomy</b> {{to the study of}} culture, using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees {{an important part of the}} discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E
5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of <b>archaeoastronomy</b> today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on <b>archaeoastronomy,</b> especially in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Frankfurt {{historian}} of science Willy Hartner in 1969 published an interpretation involving gematria and <b>archaeoastronomy,</b> taking {{many of the}} figures as representing constellations, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.|$|E
25|$|Outside of his {{academic}} specialities, Lomas writes on the Neolithic period and <b>archaeoastronomy,</b> ancient mysteries, stone monuments and megaliths, and on astronomical and astrological topics, {{as well as}} the history, ritual, and spiritual journey of Freemasonry. He has also written a biography of the electrical pioneer, Nikola Tesla.|$|E
25|$|Archaeo-optics, or archaeological optics, is {{the study}} of the {{experience}} and ritual use of light by ancient peoples. Archaeological optics is a branch of sensory archaeology, which explores human perceptions of the physical environment in the remote past, and is a sibling of <b>archaeoastronomy,</b> which deals with ancient observations of celestial bodies, and archaeological acoustics, which deals with applications of sound.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of <b>archaeoastronomy</b> at Chaco {{has been}} proposed, with the Sun Dagger {{petroglyph}} at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings {{may have been}} aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles, requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction. Climate change {{is thought to have}} led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a 50-year drought that started in 1130.|$|E
25|$|Archaeology {{developed}} out of antiquarianism in Europe {{during the}} 19th century, {{and has since}} become a discipline practiced across the world. Archaeology {{has been used by}} nation-states to create particular visions of the past. Since its early development, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed, including maritime archaeology, feminist archaeology and <b>archaeoastronomy,</b> and numerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid archaeological investigation. Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with pseudoarchaeology, the looting of artifacts, a lack of public interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains.|$|E
25|$|The main {{tourist attractions}} of the Eastern Hills of Bogotá are the Monserrate and Guadalupe Hills, the former a pilgrimage site for centuries. Other trails in the Eastern Hills follow the creeks of La Vieja, Las Delicias and others. The busy road Bogotá – La Calera crosses the Eastern Hills in the central-northern part and the highway between Bogotá and Villavicencio {{traverses}} the southernmost {{area of the}} hills. The {{eastern side of the}} Eastern Hills is part of the municipalities La Calera, Choachí, Ubaque and Chipaque. The Eastern Hills were sparsely populated in pre-Columbian times, considered sacred by the indigenous Muisca. The native people constructed temples and shrines in the Eastern Hills and buried their dead there. The Guadalupe and Monserrate Hills, important in Muisca religion and <b>archaeoastronomy,</b> are the hilltops from where Sué, the Sun, rises on the December and June solstices respectively, when viewed from the present-day Bolívar Square. The construction and expansion of the Colombian capital in Spanish colonial times caused excessive deforestation of the Eastern Hills. Reforestations were executed in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
500|$|<b>Archaeoastronomy</b> (also spelled archeoastronomy) is {{the study}} of how people in the past [...] "have {{understood}} the phenomena in the sky, how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their cultures". Clive Ruggles argues it is misleading to consider <b>archaeoastronomy</b> to be the study of ancient astronomy, as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while <b>archaeoastronomy</b> considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures. It is often twinned with ethnoastronomy, the anthropological study of skywatching in contemporary societies. <b>Archaeoastronomy</b> is also closely associated with historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.|$|E
500|$|There are {{currently}} three academic organisations for scholars of <b>archaeoastronomy.</b> {{was founded in}} 1995 and now sponsors the Oxford conferences and <b>Archaeoastronomy</b> — the Journal of Astronomy in Culture. is slightly older; it was created in 1992. SEAC holds annual conferences in Europe and publishes refereed conference proceedings on an annual basis. There is also , primarily a Latin American organisation {{which was founded in}} 2003. Two new organisations focused on regional <b>archaeoastronomy</b> were founded in 2013: [...] in Australia and [...] in New Zealand.|$|E

500|$|The term <b>archaeoastronomy</b> {{was first}} used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the {{suggestion}} of Euan MacKie) in 1973, but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how <b>archaeoastronomy</b> is defined. Clive Ruggles says that Heinrich Nissen, working {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair says that Norman Lockyer, working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy'. Euan MacKie would place the origin even later, stating: [...] "...the genesis and modern flowering of <b>archaeoastronomy</b> must surely lie in the work of Alexander Thom in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s".|$|E
500|$|Additionally the Journal for the History of Astronomy publishes many archaeoastronomical papers. For twenty-seven volumes (from 1979 to 2002) it {{published}} an annual supplement <b>Archaeoastronomy.</b> [...] The Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage (National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand), Culture & Cosmos (University of Wales, UK) and Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry (University of Aegean, Greece) also publish papers on <b>archaeoastronomy.</b>|$|E

500|$|<b>Archaeoastronomy</b> can {{be applied}} to all {{cultures}} and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which {{can be applied}} across cultures when examining ancient beliefs. It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of <b>archaeoastronomy</b> which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as: [...] "... field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other".|$|E
500|$|The {{reactions}} of professional archaeologists to <b>archaeoastronomy</b> have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream {{of what they}} saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers. [...] Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from <b>archaeoastronomy</b> into archaeology textbooks and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.|$|E

500|$|Both {{practicing}} archaeoastronomers {{and observers}} of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view <b>archaeoastronomy</b> {{as part of an}} archaeology informed by cultural anthropology and aimed at understanding a [...] "group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology. [...] Todd Bostwick argued that [...] "archaeoastronomy is anthropology – the study of human behavior in the past and present." [...] Paul Bahn has described <b>archaeoastronomy</b> as an area of cognitive archaeology. Other researchers relate <b>archaeoastronomy</b> to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations or {{as it relates to the}} political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques. [...] Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing [...] "the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism" [...] Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable precursors of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.|$|E
500|$|<b>Archaeoastronomy</b> {{has long}} been seen as an {{interdisciplinary}} field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures. [...] As such, {{it can be seen}} as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), history of astronomy (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).|$|E
500|$|<b>Archaeoastronomy</b> owes {{something}} of this poor reputation among scholars to its occasional misuse to advance {{a range of}} pseudo-historical accounts. During the 1930s, Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled Germanische Himmelskunde, or [...] "Teutonic Skylore". The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the Ancient Near East {{in the field of}} astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the [...] "Aryans" [...] (Indo-Europeans) over the Semites.|$|E
500|$|Between AD 900 and 1150, Chaco Canyon {{was a major}} {{center of}} culture for the Ancient Pueblo Peoples. Chacoans quarried {{sandstone}} blocks and hauled timber from great distances, assembling fifteen major complexes that remained the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century. Evidence of <b>archaeoastronomy</b> at Chaco has been proposed, with the [...] "Sun Dagger" [...] petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles, requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction. Climate change {{is thought to have}} led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a fifty-year drought commencing in 1130.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green <b>archaeoastronomy</b> is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s {{the work}} of the {{engineer}} Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer Gerald Hawkins, who proposed that Stonehenge was a Neolithic computer, inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed, but {{this was not the case}} for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of megalithic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles. [...] Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain. In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence. Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, Krupp wrote in 1979, [...] "Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades." [...] His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of <b>archaeoastronomy.</b>|$|E
