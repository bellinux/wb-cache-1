5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the {{advanced}} platoon of E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived {{on top of}} Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. Some of the engineers fired on the E Company men before the latter identified themselves. The E Company platoon went into position {{on the right of}} Vandygriff, and Kennedy turned over command of the combined force to the E Company commander. Kennedy then assembled 12 wounded men <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the mountain with them. The party was under small arms fire most of the way. A carrying party of Korean A-frame porters led by an American officer had started up the mountain during the morning with supplies. North Korean fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back.|$|E
25|$|Once {{across the}} Snake River ford near Old Fort Boise the weary {{travelers}} traveled across {{what would become}} the state of Oregon. The trail then went to the Malheur River and then past Farewell Bend on the Snake River, up the Burnt River canyon and northwest to the Grande Ronde Valley near present-day La Grande before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable {{for the first time to}} wagons. The trail went to the Whitman Mission near Fort Nez Perces in Washington until 1847 when the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day Pendleton, Oregon, crossing the Umatilla River, John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Toronto-based writer Sarah Liss {{published}} Army of Lovers: A Community History of Will Munro, a {{book which}} collected reminiscences about Munro from his family, friends and colleagues. The book's launch party, dubbed Vaza-Launch, featured performances by both Peaches and Light Fires. The book {{is divided into}} three parts (Mississauga Goddam, Rock Show, and Heaven), which all work to highlight what an extraordinary talent Munro had for community cultivation. It begins with Munro's childhood spent in Mississauga, which both of his parents state that Munro and his brother, Dave, [...] "hated Mississauga." [...] (pg. 16) Dave Munro recalls that Will experienced a sudden shift in personality in or slightly before grade seven, where he became a different person: [...] "Will was like, 'Fuck doing after-school-programs,' <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> his own path" [...] (pg. 23).|$|E
60|$|The whole river {{seemed to}} pick itself up <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>down</b> the stream. With the {{increasing}} motion the ice-wall broke {{in a hundred}} places, and from {{up and down the}} shore came the rending and crashing of uprooted trees.|$|R

500|$|On 17 September 1950 {{a pair of}} Grumman F9F-2 Panthers {{launched}} from the deck of [...] Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section [...] dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield {{turned out to be}} little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> the Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from [...] "passengers" [...] on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from [...] AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to [...] "clothesline" [...] low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship {{and with the help of}} LSO Lt.j.g."Les" [...] Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.|$|E
2500|$|As {{well as his}} {{pressure}} technique, Freud's clinical procedures involved analytic inference and {{the symbolic}} interpretation of symptoms to trace back to memories of infantile sexual abuse. His claim of one hundred percent confirmation of his theory only served to reinforce previously expressed reservations from his colleagues {{about the validity of}} findings obtained through his suggestive techniques. Freud subsequently showed inconsistency as to whether his seduction theory was still compatible with his later findings. In an addendum to The Aetiology of Hysteria he stated: [...] "All this is true but it must be remembered that at the time I wrote it I had not yet freed myself from my overvaluation of reality and my low valuation of phantasy". Some years later Freud explicitly rejected the claim of his colleague Ferenczi that his patients’ reports of sexual molestation were actual memories instead of fantasies, and he tried to dissuade Ferenczi from making his views public. Karin Ahbel-Rappe concludes in her study [...] "'I no longer believe': did Freud abandon the seduction theory?’’: [...] "Freud marked out <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>down</b> a trail of investigation into the nature of the experience of infantile incest {{and its impact on the}} human psyche, and then abandoned this direction for the most part." ...|$|E

50|$|Siegfried arrives, and the Wanderer {{questions}} the youth. Siegfried, {{who does not}} recognize his grandfather, answers insolently <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>down</b> the path toward Brünnhilde's rock. The Wanderer blocks his path, but Siegfried mocks him, laughing at his floppy hat and his missing eye, and breaks his spear (the symbol of Wotan's authority) with a blow from Nothung. Wotan calmly gathers up the pieces and vanishes.|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} minor of a {{major key}} has the same key signature <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>down</b> a minor third (or equivalently up a major sixth); for example, the relative minor of G major is E minor. Similarly the relative major of a minor key starts up a minor third (or down a major sixth); for example, the relative major of F minor is A major.|$|R

5000|$|Nicklaus uses a flash grenade to escape, {{prompting}} Bishop and Sheila {{to chase}} {{him as he}} boards a plane <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>down</b> the runway.

50|$|After {{a period}} of silence, Carter tells Bird to hide <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>down</b> the stairs. Sade in the {{meanwhile}} makes his way barefoot across the roof.

Fed-up, Sade plans to set the house on fire, but changes his mind and calls Carter's wife on Carter's cell phone which he had found earlier. Resting again, the men engage in another argument.|$|R

50|$|The nihilistic Raveners look at {{the broken}} world and wasted {{potential}} of humanity and believe there's only one option left: destroy everything - first humanity, then themselves.

They are enemies with all the other factions of demons, though they can tolerate the Cryptics as the Raveners assume they will eventually stop asking questions <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>down</b> destructive paths.|$|R
6000|$|Jombateeste {{waited to}} hear no more injuries.

60|$|Toby ate {{his breakfast}} very hurriedly, <b>and</b> then <b>started</b> <b>down</b> {{the road in}} the {{direction}} of his partners' homes, for he thought there would be a better chance of capturing the runaway if four or five boys set out in pursuit than if he went out alone.|$|R
