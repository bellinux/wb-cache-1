5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E

5|$|As was {{customary}} Collier {{received a}} promotion, to master and commander on 3 September 1799, and a command, the 18-gun sloop , on 21 October. Collier commanded the Victor {{for the next}} couple of years, escorting convoys and on one occasion a convoy of troop transports to the Red Sea, bringing troops to defeat the French forces in Egypt. He stopped briefly at Diego Garcia to take on supplies, whereupon he fell in with the 22-gun French corvette Flèche. The two ships fought a brief engagement on 1 September 1801, during which the Flèche damaged the Victors rigging and managed to escape. After repairing the damage, Collier searched the surrounding area before coming across his opponent on 5 September, sheltering in Mahé Roads. The channel was very narrow, and the wind unfavourable, but Collier managed to warp the Victor into the harbour, and with the aid of her staysails, closed on the French ship. After enduring raking fire for sometime, he was finally able to haul his ship <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two vessels exchanged broadsides for over two hours. By then the Flèche was observed to be in a sinking condition, and her captain ran her aground. A party of men were sent over from the Victor, but having boarded the French vessel, found her crew had set her on fire and then abandoned ship. The men were temporarily evacuated while further assistance was sent across, after which they re-boarded and managed to extinguish the fire. Just as this had been achieved, the Flèche slipped off the reef into deeper water and sank.|$|E

5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock breeds in {{the early}} months of the year and, on average, lays its eggs around March. During the height of the mating season, males engage in {{competitive}} displays in lek, which is a complex courting behaviour that is done to attract females. Males and females live separately except when the females choose a mate. The mating success varies based on multiple factors, ranging from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. The females choose a male by flying down to the ground and pecking the male on his rump. The male then turns <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mating takes place almost immediately. There is speculation that the male-to-male competition {{is an important factor in}} lek formation and breeding.

25|$|A {{slow start}} by openers Rajin Saleh and Javed Omar cost the Bangladeshis dearly in this warm-up match against {{a side of}} Sri Lankan fringe players at Moratuwa, along with an {{inability}} to take wickets. The pair added 59 for the first wicket, but never really got off the mark, and when Pradeep Jayaprakashdaran dismissed Omar and Aftab Ahmed in quick succession things looked tricky. The other Bangladeshis were forced to hit out quickly, and two run outs followed as a result. In the end, it was the experienced all-rounders Mohammad Rafique and Khaled Mashud who ensured that Bangladesh set a somewhat competitive target of 236. However, Avishka Gunawardene and Upul Tharanga both made centuries, the Bangladeshi bowlers were thoroughly hit <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sri Lankans {{made their way to}} 236 for 0 in just 36.1 overs of the 50 possible.

25|$|The 1988–89 season saw the Islanders win {{only seven}} {{of their first}} 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back.

Not long {{after the end of the}} season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned over day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal, Stephen Walsh, and Paul Greenwood. In return, they each bought a 2.5 interest in the team. In the next season, the Islanders rebounded to get back in the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of Bryan Trottier's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The 1990–91 season had the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.|$|E

500|$|The {{melting point}} of a {{substance}} is {{the point where it}} changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling {{point of a}} substance (in liquid state) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group. This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons. As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points. (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.) ...|$|E
500|$|Murray {{was born}} on 2 March 1705, at Scone Palace in Perthshire, Scotland, the fourth son of the 5th Viscount of Stormont and his wife, Margaret, née Scott, and one of eleven children.

The Jacobite sympathies of Murray's family were glossed over by contemporaries, who claimed that he had been educated at Lichfield Grammar School with many other members of the English judiciary. This was incorrect, as Murray was educated at Perth Grammar School, where he was taught Latin, English grammar, and essay writing skills. He later said that this gave him a great advantage at university, as those students educated in England had been taught Greek and Latin, but not how to write properly in English. While at Perth Grammar School, it became apparent that Murray was particularly intelligent, and in 1718, his father and older brother James decided to send him to Westminster School, as James knew the Dean, Francis Atterbury.
