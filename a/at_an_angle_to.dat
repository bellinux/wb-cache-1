5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, {{and a pair}} of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may lie on the site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.|$|E

5|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards {{each other and the}} flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow was packed with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed {{to take off the}} crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left.|$|E

5|$|Planets {{also have}} {{varying degrees of}} axial tilt; they lie <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light {{received}} by each hemisphere to vary {{over the course of}} its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices. Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt {{as a result of their}} proximity to their stars.|$|E

25|$|The offset may be {{implemented}} by curving the forks, adding a perpendicular tab at their lower ends, offseting the fork blade sockets of the fork crown {{ahead of the}} steerer, or by mounting the forks into the crown <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the steer tube.

25|$|The Olympic salute is {{a variant}} of the Roman salute, with the right arm and hand are {{stretched}} and pointing upward, the palm is outward and downward, with the fingers touching.

25|$|These {{distributions}} {{represent the}} spectral radiance of blackbodies—the power emitted from the emitting surface, per unit projected area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per spectral unit (frequency, wavelength, wavenumber or their angular equivalents). Since the radiance is isotropic (i.e. independent of direction), the power emitted <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the normal {{is proportional to}} the projected area, and therefore to the cosine of that angle as per Lambert's cosine law, and is unpolarized.|$|E
25|$|Heavy land {{requires}} draining {{to reduce}} its water content to a level satisfactory for efficient plant growth. Heavy soils usually have a system of permanent drains using either perforated plastic or clay pipes which discharge into a ditch. Mole ploughs are used to form small tunnels (mole drains) in the soil {{at a depth of}} up to 950mm (30in) <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the pipe drains. Water from the mole drains seeps into the pipes and runs along them into a ditch.|$|E
25|$|Joints {{are used}} in {{continuous}} welded rail when necessary, usually for signal circuit gaps. Instead of a joint that passes straight across the rail, the two rail ends are sometimes cut <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> give a smoother transition. In extreme cases, such as {{at the end of}} long bridges, a breather switch (referred to in North America and Britain as an expansion joint) gives a smooth path for the wheels while allowing the end of one rail to expand relative to the next rail.|$|E

25|$|The diagram to {{the left}} shows a BA-hand (flat hand) in six orientations. For the three {{vertical}} orientations on the left side, the hand is held {{in front of the}} signer, fingers pointing upward. All three glyphs can be rotated, like the hands of a clock, to show the fingers pointing <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>to</b> the side, or downward. For the three horizontal orientations {{on the right side of}} the diagram, the hand is held outward, with the fingers pointing away from the signer, and presumably toward the viewer. They can also be rotated to show the fingers pointing to the side or toward the signer. Although an indefinite number of orientations can be represented this way, in practice only eight are used for each plane—that is, only multiples of 45° are found.|$|E
25|$|During a {{free-fall}} with no aerodynamic forces, {{the object}} accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity {{as the object}} descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} built in red flecked sandstone, and the nave roof is in Ruabon tiles. The aisle roofs are in lead. Its plan {{consists}} of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles which embrace a west tower, and north and south transepts, a chancel. The northwest porch is set <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> {{the church and the}} south porch is perpendicular to it. The church is built in Perpendicular style. The north transept is in one bay and includes the organ. The south transept is in three bays and forms a Lady chapel. The tower has a projecting octagonal staircase on the southeast corner and buttresses on the southeast corner. An inscribed frieze of the Te Deum runs around the tower and below the parapet of the south and east sides of the church.|$|E
