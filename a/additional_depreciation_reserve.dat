To make the matter clear Intermatch Sweden AB {{has pointed out that}} they consider deductions for depreciations not to {{have an effect on the}} foreign income when the amount to settle is calculated. The intention with this study is to analyse the legal situation regarding how the level of the settlement is affected by the consolidated costs. Such as <b>additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> regulated in the law “Settlements of foreign tax”. In the process I will aspire to address the arguments of the study with the help of one ruling put in focus and related previous ruling. <b>Additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> of the assets, which arise due to the depreciation as recorded in the books, should not reduce the foreign income when the level of settlement is to be calculated the RegR has pronounced. I don’t see a complete analogy in the way the different consolidated costs has affected the outcome of the rulings in regards to the level of settlement. By that I mean that the costs at hand have affected the calculation in different ways and these differences have not been presented by the company in question In doing so disregarding how the denominator and the Swedish tax are affected. A new bill has been accepted and will take effect on January 1 st 2009 witch means that the issues at hand will lead to a different conclusion since <b>additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> after January 1 st 2009 will be treated as a cost of the operations when calculating the level of settlement...|$|R

30|$|We used panel {{data about}} the 26 Swiss cantons over the period 1980 – 2013. This setting is {{interesting}} since the individual cantonal legislation sets out or tolerates depreciations management operations especially designed to inflate expenses—with the so-called <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges—and thus to worsen the financial performance {{in a way to}} specifically manage surpluses. Two different models of fiscal performance were estimated. The first model relies on a single equation with the balance (deficit or surplus) as the dependent variable. In the second model, the impact on the balance is indirectly considered since a set of two simultaneous equations is used: one with the operating revenues as the dependent variable and the other with operating expenses as the dependent variable. This simultaneous strategy allowed us to disentangle the respective effect of depreciations management on revenues and expenses and therefore provide more precise estimations compared to the single-equation model. The econometric results are based on several estimators and proved to be robust. They confirm that a positive and significant correlation exists between previous <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges and the subsequent level of revenues, whereas a negative correlation exists with the level of subsequent expenses, with a similar order of magnitude. Consequently, depreciations management seems to produce a significant positive impact on the future balance.|$|R

The thesis deals with description of items that can influence a tax base. These are mainly <b>depreciations,</b> <b>reserves</b> and adjustments. One of the parts describes the ways of influencing a tax base in case of obligation of recording according to IFRS. The thesis mentions the problems linked with this as well...|$|R
5000|$|Priority 1 {{investments}}: {{investments that}} shall be released immediately after respective cash (and income to cover <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> expenses) is available. Similar to the expenses, a decision {{has to be}} taken if priority 1 investments have to be released all at once or if they may re partly released as the cash and income situation allows to do so partly. If partial release applies, further decisions have to be taken on the sequence (having 120 cash available, shall the one big investment for 100 or the 2 small for 50 each be release?).|$|R
30|$|The cantonal {{setting is}} also {{valuable}} since a common and detailed chart of account allows {{those with the}} necessary accounting skills and understanding to detect the book entries related to depreciations management. The main book entry that allows finance ministers to inflate expenses is the so-called <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges (AD). With some insight and expert knowledge, the amount of AD that is charged to an accounting period can be spotted in the detailed annual general purpose financial report 6 of the period, since a specific budget heading in the chart of accounts is used for AD.|$|R
30|$|The {{heterogeneity}} is also {{strong in}} terms of reported and true balances of the statement of financial performance. Nonetheless, the standard deviation appears to be smaller for reported balances in many cantons, suggesting that AD is effectively used to smooth reported balances. On average <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges lower the surplus from +[*] 129 CHF per capita down to a reported amount of +[*] 61 CHF per capita. This points {{out the fact that}} Swiss cantons generally experienced a structural surplus which was partially managed thanks to the use of AD. This is at least true for cantons presenting a positive true balance (B[*]>[*] 0) on average between 1980 and 2013.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} demand for the three {{individual}} components of aggregate investment demand: (1) demand by businesses for plant and equipment, (2) business inventory investment and (3) residential housing construction. The models tested are largely based on Keynesian theories of business investment demand, with some allowance for residential housing demand being more driven by Keynes’ consumer demand variables. Other possible determinants of investment are also tested, including ”crowd out” effects of government deficits on business investment and demographic effects on the residential construction market. Annual data for the U. S., 1960 – 2000, are tested using two stage least squares regression techniques modified to eliminate heteroskedasticity in the data. The models are estimated in “first differences”, rather than levels of the data to reduce the effects of multicollinearity, non stationarity and autocorrelation. The models explain about 90 % {{of the variance in}} plant and equipment demand, 85 % of the variance in residential housing demand for and 67 % of inventory demand. The results indicate that demand for each of these three types of investment goods is driven by different combinations of variables Business investment in plant and equipment appears determined by how much the overall economy is growing (the accelerator effect), the availability of credit (crowd out), the availability of <b>depreciation</b> <b>reserves,</b> the prime interest rate lagged three years, business profits and stock values lagged one year, and the effects of an exchange rate change over the four year period following the change. Inventory investment seems mainly determined by availability of <b>depreciation</b> <b>reserves,</b> crowd out, interest rates, unexpected changes in consumer demand and the accelerator. Residential construction demand seems mainly driven by disposable income, the effect of general growth in the economy on consumer spending (the accelerator), credit availability (crowd out), current year mortgage rates, and prior year consumer wealth levels. ...|$|R
30|$|In view of this, the {{improvement}} in subsequent financial performance stemming from (previous) <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> charges seems to come through both channels: a support for (subsequent) tax revenue and a pressure on (subsequent) operating expenses. The effect is almost equal, with 1 additional CHF AD per capita corresponding with subsequent revenues to be 0.207 CHF higher and subsequent expenses to be 0.262 CHF lower (model I). Thus, the combined effect improves subsequent financial performance by about 0.469 CHF per capita. This impact is slightly larger than the one estimated from the single-equation model. However, this measure is more precise since the simultaneous-equation model partials out more precisely {{the effects of the}} control variables on expenses and revenues.|$|R

It offers an empirical analysis of the key determinants affecting the decision to undertake these measures over the period September 2008 -March 2009. The paper finds that economy size, access to international credit markets, CDS spreads, currency depreciation, and current account balances are among the key factors influencing the adoption of these measures. It provides a rationale for the differences in central bank policy responses, which reflect differences in economic structures rather than conflicting views on fundamental principles. The paper also provides a preliminary assessment {{of the effectiveness of}} these measures and points out that despite their positive impacts, they have not fully shielded the real economy from the recent financial meltdown.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the impact of previous creative accounting operations on the government’s financial performance, two approaches are used following Krishnakumar et al. (2010). A single-equation model directly estimates the impact of <b>additional</b> <b>depreciations</b> booked in the past on deficits and surpluses. Alternatively, a system of two equations, one for true revenues and one for true expenses, models the impact of previous creative accounting operations on the actual financial performance. Because of the conservative stance of the cantonal fiscal policy, models are estimated with regard to different possible outcomes. Model I considers all observation irrespective of {{the sign of the}} (subsequent) balance. Model II considers only the case where the (subsequent) true balance is positive (surplus). Model III is when the (subsequent) true balance is negative (deficit). Previous AD are especially expected to enhance (subsequent) surpluses.|$|R

40|$|The {{main problem}} that necessitates {{the revival of}} {{investment}} in joint stock companies is unsatisfactory condition of fixed assets of enterprises. The low rate of production capacity renewal {{in recent years has}} even become slower; the equipment wear rate is 4 – 5 times lower than in the industrialized countries. In addition to these points, one should consider a significant qualitative lag of domestic technologies in comparison with the world analogues. The purpose of this research is the generalization and improvement of the existing approaches to the formation of motivations system of domestic corporations production investing and the development of corporation investment strategy. The subject of the work is the system of motivations of production investing, formation of which will be provided by the unique complex influence on the investment activity of domestic corporations. All the directions and forms of investment activity of corporations are carried out due to the investment resources. Forming the investment resources strategy is the important component of financial strategy of a corporation. Among the domestic sources of investment financing, the main element is profit, or rather the part that remains at the disposal of the corporation after payment and settlement with shareholders. Another important source is depreciation. Their size depends on the amount of assets of the corporation and <b>depreciation</b> <b>reserved.</b> Under the conditions of the developed financial market the important source of the external financing is emission of own securities (stocks and bonds). Another motivational factor of bringing in of long-term fund raising can be the use of leasing. Leasing, as a source of investment resources has certain advantages in comparison with other forms of investing. The important sources of capital for productive investment are the foreign investments. In author's opinion, it is possible to increase the investment attractiveness of Ukrainian joint stock companies, by improving the legal, economic and information mechanism of investment activities. Consequently, characterizing the system of motivations of the production investing of stock associations {{it should be noted that}} the considerable part of capital is generated by an enterprise itself due to the <b>depreciation</b> <b>reserves,</b> others act due to a capital issue under the concrete investment programs and projects, bringing in the investment funds, resources insurance companies, commercial banks, non-standard methods of financing of investment activity...|$|R

40|$|Current {{economic}} conditions are forcing {{a number of}} farmers to re-appraise their programmes of machinery replacement. Historically plant {{has been a significant}} component of Total Farm Capital on many New Zealand farms, particularly those involved with cropping. Recent substantial increases in the purchasing price of all items of farm machinery have meant that normal <b>depreciation</b> <b>reserves</b> are no longer capable of financing the replacement of major items of plant. The small farmer particularly is faced with this problem, and due to low usage rates and consequent high overhead costs, many large items of agricultural equipment are beyond his resources. In addition, wage inflation has encouraged the substitution of capital for labour. An existing alternative to the purchase of machinery is the use of contract services, but farmers find this a costly alternative for some types of operation. Additionally where timeliness is important, they may be reluctant to rely heavily on outside operators. A second alternative which is gaining popularity overseas is machinery syndication. Where the purchase and sole use of a large machine is clearly uneconomic for individuals a group of farmers combining to purchase the same machine may derive the benefit of a new and technologically advanced machine at acceptable costs...|$|R

40|$|The {{accounting}} for business combinations {{has long been}} one of the most controversial financial reporting issues, generating numerous opinions and interpretations by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF). At the center of the controversy is the principal established in 1970 by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APBO) No. 16 that both the purchase method and the pooling-of-interests method are acceptable in {{accounting for}} business combinations. The distinction between purchase and pooling relates mainly to how the difference between the price paid for the common shares of the acquired company and the book value of its net assets (herein referred to as the "step-up") is accounted for on the consolidated financial statements. Under the pooling method, the step-up is not recognized and the net assets of the acquired company are combined with those of the acquiring company at their book values as though the two companies had always been a single enterprise. Under the purchase method, the acquiring company recognizes the differential by restating all assets and liabilities of the acquired company to their fair values. Consequently, the <b>additional</b> <b>depreciation</b> and amortization expense arising from the asset write-up often associated with the purchase method leads to post-merger earnings that can be substantially lower than those reported under the pooling treatment. ...|$|R

40|$|With Germany's banking sector still {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} the financial crisis, public discussion of plans to place toxic assets in one or more bad banks has gained steam in recent weeks. The following paper presents a bad bank plan from the German Institute for Economic Research. The key element of the plan is the valuation of troubled assets at their current market value - assets with no market would thus be valued at zero. The current shareholders will cover the losses arising from the <b>depreciation</b> <b>reserve</b> in the amount of the difference of the toxic assets' current book value and their market value. Under the plan, the government would bear responsibility for the management and future resale of toxic assets at its own cost and recapitalize the good bank by taking an equity stake in it. In extreme cases, this would mean a takeover of the bank by the government. The risk to taxpayers from this investment would be acceptable, however, once the banks are freed from toxic assets. A clear emphasis that the government stake is temporary would also be necessary. The government would cover the bad bank's losses, while profits would be distributed to the distressed bank's current shareholders. The plan is viable independent of whether the government decides to have one centralized bad bank or to establish a separate bad bank for each systemically relevant banking institute. Under the terms of the plan, bad banks and nationalization are not alternatives but rather {{two sides of the same}} coin. This plan effectively addresses three key challenges. It provides for the transparent removal of toxic assets and gives the banks a fresh start. At the same time, it offers the chance to keep the cost to taxpayers low. In addition, the risk of moral hazard is curtailed. Financial crisis, Bad bank, Recapitalization...|$|R
