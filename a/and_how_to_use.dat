5|$|With the {{emergence}} of trios (tag teams consisting of three people) such as Los Misioneros de la Muerte, Los Brazos and more, the six-man tag team match became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Its popularity led to the trios format becoming the most prevalent match format in Lucha libre to this day. The popularity {{led to the creation}} of the first trios championship in Mexico when the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) created the UWA World Trios Championship in 1984. The Mexican National Trios Championship was created in 1985, at the request of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) and endorsed by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission. The commission granted EMLL the rights to promote the championship, which meant that CMLL had control over the everyday use of the championship, determining which storylines the title wre being used in, who were allowed to challenge for the title <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it in a public relations sense. The Commission would oversee the rule and approves any championship change that EMLL proposed.|$|E

25|$|A {{study on}} {{examining}} sexual messages in popular TV shows found that 2 out of 3 programs contained sexually related actions. 1 out of 15 shows included scenes {{of sexual intercourse}} itself. Shows featured a variety of sexual messages, including characters talking about when they wanted to have sex <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> sex to keep a relationship alive. Some researchers believe that adolescents can use these messages {{as well as the}} sexual actions they see on TV in their own sexual lives.|$|E
25|$|Developments {{in other}} fields of science: DNA {{analysis}} has had an impact in various areas of history either confirming established historical theories or presenting new evidence that undermines the current established historical explanation. Professor Andrew Sherratt, a British prehistorian, was responsible for introducing the work of anthropological writings on the consumption of currently legal and illegal drugs <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> these papers to explain certain aspects of prehistoric societies. Carbon dating, the examination of ice cores and tree rings, palynology, SEM analysis of early metal samples, and measuring oxygen isotopes in bones, have all provided new data {{in the last few}} decades with which to argue new hypotheses. Extracting ancient DNA allows scientists to argue whether or not humans are partly descended from Neanderthals.|$|E

25|$|The {{transition}} from gruit to hops throughout Europe in the Middle Ages was a piecemeal, region-by-region process that lasted at least 500 years. It took time for farmers {{to learn of}} the existence of hops, how to farm them, when to cultivate them, and their value in brewing beer. Brewers had to learn the favourable and unfavourable characteristics of hops, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> hops to craft commercially successful beer. Even in the Middle Ages beer was an international commodity, and major brewing cities developed distinctive styles and reputations. Brewers had to consider the marketability of their beer, and competition from imports. Furthermore, regulations limited brewing ingredients in some jurisdictions. Even when a monarch permitted hop brewing, the hops might be taxed. What steps John took to institute hops in Flemish brewing is not documented, but he lived during a time when hops were being legalised in nearby jurisdictions. He was age 20 or 21 in 1392, when Duke Albert I granted the Dutch cities of Haarlem and Gouda permission to brew beer with hops.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though in}} most {{statistical}} classification methods, the neutral class is ignored {{under the assumption}} that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier, several researchers suggest that, as in every polarity problem, three categories must be identified. Moreover, it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the Max Entropy and the SVMs can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification. There are in principle two ways for operating with a neutral class. Either, the algorithm proceeds by first identifying the neutral language, filtering it out and then assessing the rest in terms of positive and negative sentiments, or it builds a three-way classification in one step. This second approach often involves estimating a probability distribution over all categories (e.g. naive Bayes classifiers as implemented by the NLTK). Whether <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a neutral class depends {{on the nature of the}} data: if the data is clearly clustered into neutral, negative and positive language, it makes sense to filter the neutral language out and focus on the polarity between positive and negative sentiments. If, in contrast, the data are mostly neutral with small deviations towards positive and negative affect, this strategy would make it harder to clearly distinguish between the two poles.|$|E
25|$|The Mask of Life's descent ends in Mahri Nui, an {{underwater}} city originally part of Voya Nui before it broke off and {{sunk into the}} sea. Upon sight, it becomes an object {{of interest to the}} Matoran villagers as well as the Barraki: six former warlords sent to the Pit (a prison that sits on the lip of the city) after their crimes as part of the League of Six Kingdoms. But after the Pit was damaged in the Great Cataclysm, they escaped into the surrounding ocean and were mutated by its mutagen waters. Believing the mask can change them back so they can rule the Kingdoms once again, the Barraki battle one another for possession of the Ignika. Meanwhile, the Toa Inika continue their descent through the stone cord, where they battle mutated incarnations of the Piraka, Vezon and an army of murderous Zyglak. Upon reaching the depths of the sea, the Mask of Life transforms the heroes into the water-breathing Toa Mahri, complete with new masks and weapons. The team engage with the Barraki and their aquatic Rahi armies upon arrival, but {{in the midst of the}} battle, Matoro is imprisoned in the Pit by a robotic Maxilos guard that reveals itself as Makuta Teridax, who possessed the robot after his essence followed the Toa through the stone cord. He informs Matoro that Mata Nui's life can only be saved if the Toa shatter the cord, and although not trustful in the villain's words, he relays the information to his team-mates. They agree and evacuate Matoran from both locations before proceeding to destroy the cord; sending Voya Nui plummeting into the ocean and demolishing Mahri Nui in the process. But by the time the Toa Mahri retrieve the Ignika, Mata Nui dies. Believing there's still hope, Matoro - the one person who can touch the Ignika without becoming cursed - races towards a hole in the seabed with it before Voya Nui descends to close it, leaving his team to continue fighting the Barraki. Once in, he falls through a waterfall in what resembles a large cave and hears a voice from inside the mask telling him to put it on. In doing so, Matoro learns of the Ignika's history <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it to resurrect Mata Nui. Now knowing it was his destiny to sacrifice himself to save the universe, Matoro uses the sentient mask's powers to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and make them amphibious, before the mask turns his body into pure energy that saves the Great Spirit. Meanwhile, the Maxilos body that Teridax inhabited is found badly damaged after a ferocious battle with the Barraki's armies, and is so presumed dead. Mata Nui has been saved, but remains asleep.|$|E

500|$|Operation Deny Flight, {{and other}} NATO {{operations}} during the Bosnian War, resulted in significant tension within NATO and the Atlantic relationship. [...] Deny Flight and other early operations [...] "forced the Allies {{to consider the}} question of NATO's military responsibility for territory outside of its traditional defense perimeter, {{and it was one}} over which they were deeply divided". [...] Disagreements between the United States and its European allies over when <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> air power [...] "made intra-alliance diplomacy more problematic" [...] during the period. [...] Many of these problems in the relationship were the result of concerns from European nations who had forces on the ground in UNPROFOR that might be taken hostage. [...] The fact that the United States pushed for air strikes without placing its own forces on the ground in Bosnia greatly exacerbated this problem.|$|E

[...] Pollack considers that the song's long coda provides [...] "an astonishingly transcendental effect", while AllMusic's Richie Unterberger similarly opines: [...] "What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney varies the vocal {{with some of the}} greatest nonsense scatting ever heard in rock …" [...] In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald wrote that the [...] "pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out may be a blemish" [...] but he praised the song as [...] "a pop/rock hybrid drawing on the best of both idioms". MacDonald concluded: [...] "'Hey Jude' strikes a universal note, touching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle wisdom one might properly call inspired." [...] Lennon said the song was [...] "one of [...] masterpieces".|$|E

500|$|The Scream {{score was}} {{provided}} by fledgling composer Marco Beltrami, his first time scoring a feature film. Craven's assistant Julie Plec had requested input on composers who were [...] "new", [...] "fresh", and [...] "wonderful", and was given Beltrami's name by several people. Beltrami was contacted for samples of his work. Craven, impressed by what he heard, requested Beltrami come to the set to view the opening thirteen minutes of the film containing the introduction {{and the death of}} Barrymore's character. Beltrami was tasked with scoring a piece of music for this scene, which would be reviewed by the producers and the Weinstein brothers. Beltrami was hired to score the entire film {{on the basis of this}} sample. [...] Beltrami had no prior experience scoring a work of horror. Craven and editor Patrick Lussier advised him on how to deliver music that would raise the tension <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> stings to punctuate the more intense moments. Craven wanted the music to intentionally raise tension during scenes where audience expectations were already raised by their experience of previous horror films. The volume would be raised to indicate that the killer is hiding behind a door, but nothing would be present upon its opening.|$|E
