5|$|In 1923, the American {{scientist}} Robert H. Goddard {{became the}} first person to develop <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> engine that burned liquid fuel; the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56m at 97km/h on March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, US.|$|E

5|$|All four {{launches}} {{were conducted}} from Launch Area 5B at the Woomera Prohibited Area in Australia, which {{had previously been}} used as a test site for the Black Knight rocket. During the development programme, launch sites in Barbados, Uist and Norfolk were also considered. The launch sites at Uist and Norfolk were rejected because the former was too remote, while there was a risk that <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> launched from the latter might drop spent stages on an oil rig in the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1995 title, the Rockets {{opted to}} {{modernize}} their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team {{went with the}} idea of Missouri City artist Thomas Nash of <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill. Nash would later sue the Rockets for breach of contract, given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes. The NBA suggested that the identity should follow the cartoon-inspired imagery that other teams adopted during the 1990s, leading to <b>a</b> <b>rocket</b> painted with sharkmouth nose art orbiting a basketball. Red was retained, but navy blue and silver became the uniform's primary colors. Both the home white and away navy uniforms featured gradient-fading pinstripes and futuristic number fonts, with side stripes of navy fading to red. This was used until the 2002–03 season.|$|E
