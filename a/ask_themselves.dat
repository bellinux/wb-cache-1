25|$|In the Middle East and the Ottoman Empire {{the effect}} of {{liberalism}} was significant. During the 19th century, Arab, Ottoman, and Persian intellectuals visited Europe to study and learn about Western literature, science and liberal ideas. This led them to <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> about their countries' underdevelopment and concluded {{that they needed to}} promote constitutionalism, development, and liberal values to modernize their societies. At the same time, the increasing European presence in the Middle East and the stagnation of the region encouraged some Middle Eastern leaders, including Mahmud II and his son Abdülmecid I, Muhammad Ali Pasha, and Amir Kabir, to make socio-political changes and start modernization projects. In 1826, intellectual and academic Rifa'a al-Tahtawi was sent to Paris in one of the Muhammad Ali's scholar missions. Tahtawi studied ethics, social and political philosophy, and mathematics. He read works by Condillac, Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu and Bézout, among others, during his séjour in France.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} {{spent much of}} 2002 {{recording}} new material at Studio 880 in Oakland, California for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines, creating [...] "polka songs, filthy versions of Christmas tunes, [...] salsa numbers" [...] for the project, hoping to establish something new within their music. After completing twenty songs, the rough demo master tapes were stolen that November. The musicians insisted they had no leads on its whereabouts until 2016, when during an interview with NME Armstrong and Dirnt stated that they eventually recovered the material, and that the band is now using the tapes for ideas. The band consulted longtime producer Rob Cavallo about what to do next. Cavallo told the members to <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> if the missing tracks represented the group's best work. Armstrong said that the band members [...] "couldn't honestly look at ourselves and say, 'That was the best thing we've ever done.' So we decided to move on and do something completely new." [...] The band members agreed to spend the next three months writing new material.|$|E
500|$|As did the nation, fraternities at Dartmouth {{went through}} {{difficult}} {{times during the}} Great Depression. [...] The decade of the 1930s saw almost no building projects {{at all in the}} fraternity system, and many houses could no longer afford regular maintenance. [...] One of the great tragedies at Dartmouth College occurred on a winter night in 1934, when nine members of Theta Chi died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a metal chimney on a dilapidated coal furnace {{in the basement of the}} chapter house broke in the night. [...] In 1935, Dartmouth historian and professor Leon Burr Richardson asserted in a survey that, in light of the national suffering, the fraternity chapters should <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> if they had [...] "any excuse for existence." [...] Four fraternities dissolved during the Great Depression (Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omega, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Sigma Alpha Mu), and two (Phi Kappa Sigma and Alpha Chi Rho) merged to pool scarce resources in order to survive. [...] All of the surviving fraternities closed for the duration of World War II, as the campus was largely (although not exclusively) used to educate, train, and house Navy sailors and Marines in the V-12 Navy College Training Program.|$|E

500|$|... 1:54 is a {{contemporary}} African art fair held annually in London, beginning in 2013. As of 2015, 1:54 {{is the only}} art fair dedicated to contemporary African art in the primary art market. Its name refers to the 54 countries that compose the African continent, expressed as a ratio ("one continent: 54 countries"). Moroccan curator Touria El Glaoui, daughter of the artist Hassan El Glaoui, organized the fair to improve the representation of contemporary African art in worldwide art exhibitions. Representation of non-Western countries in the contemporary art world has lagged behind that of other countries. Representation of African countries, in particular, improved alongside the continent's economic growth. El Glaoui said that the continent {{did not have a}} single art scene, and that there was great diversity between African nations. Accordingly, as in the fair's title, 1:54 tries to preserve rather than homogenize the differences between each country's histories and cultures. In starting the fair, its founder was supported and advised by the British Council, the Francophonie, and partners ArtReview, Beaux Art magazine, and Art.sy. For each edition, the 1:54 organizers <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> [...] "what is necessary, what can be achieved, how [...] do something different". The fair's organizers choose exhibitors based on proposal submissions and the firms' reputation and plans. Travel visa issues have also affected whether invitees ultimately attend.|$|E
500|$|A {{section of}} critics {{wrote on the}} {{relevance}} of the movie to the current times. In an interview, Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times, adding that the times have not changed much, and that while the political extermination has gone, the psychological and political views of Romani have not. He criticised the French law that allows wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours. He was also critical of the plight of Romani in Hungary, Romania and Italy. He went on that the state of the Romani now in many places, [...] "with the rows of homeless people waiting for a bowl of soup with a tin can on their hands", is not very different from that in the concentration camps. Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969, Romani were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village. Bob Hill at Moving Pictures Network remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that [...] "we are once again veering toward a culture in which regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all", and cited present happenings such as the developments in the Middle East, racial wars and inter-country disputes. It added that the movie makes the audience <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> if they live in a society that embraces or condemns diversity.|$|E
500|$|Drawing {{attention}} to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer to <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses. He sometimes uses editing {{as a way to}} represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and crosscutting several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. In 2017, noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and crosscutting, [...] "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques ... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1976 to 1979, {{the group}} lived in campgrounds, {{usually in the}} Rocky Mountains or Texas. Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' {{heretofore}} loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention. They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants. Increasingly, they emphasized {{that they were the}} only source of truth—the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms. Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination. Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as [...] "flexibility": strict obedience to their often shifting requests. The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them. Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission—their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders. Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> what their leaders would do when making a decision. To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial: many of them found him laid back and fatherly. In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the [...] "fine art of religious entertainment", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service. Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as [...] "games". He also watched science-fiction television programs {{with the rest of the}} group. Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice. He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the [...] "illusion of choice".|$|E
