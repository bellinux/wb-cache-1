25|$|Men are {{not always}} {{themselves}} and put on their behaviour with their clothes, but if you live with a man on board ship for years, if you are continually {{with him in his}} cabin, your mind will soon find out how to appreciate him. I could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. I have not shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I <b>am</b> <b>alone,</b> I am quite like a child.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative, however. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Perhaps I <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> in sensing the off-beat love story I found {{to be at the}} heart of 'Alpha'. But it reached out and grabbed me and I found it to be touching, interesting and worthy of analysis." ...|$|E
500|$|Four Jeremy {{letters were}} written at about 1910 to Drew Fayle who thought Jeremy should marry. In one letter, Sir Isaac {{promises}} Master Fayle {{a piece of}} wedding cake should Jeremy marry and, in another letter, Ptolemy writes that Jeremy's parties [...] "would be much more agreeable {{if there were a}} lady to preside at the table." [...] Jeremy writes in the third letter: [...] "When I bought my sprigged waistcoat & my maroon tail-coat I had hopes ... but I <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> ... if there were a 'Mrs. Jeremy Fisher' she might object to snails. It is some satisfaction {{to be able to have}} as much water & mud in the house as a person likes." ...|$|E

60|$|To <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> with one's own soul. Not to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> {{without my}} own soul, mind you. But to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> with one's own soul! This, {{and the joy}} of it, is the real goal of love. My own soul, and myself. Not my ego, my conceit of myself. But my very soul. To be at one in my own self. Not to be questing any more. Not to be yearning, seeking, hoping, desiring, aspiring. But to pause, and <b>be</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R
500|$|Throughout the campaign, Lee was {{influenced}} by the belief that his men were invincible; most of Lee's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this, including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1. Since morale {{plays an important role in}} military victory when other factors are equal, Lee did not want to dampen his army's desire to fight and resisted suggestions, principally by Longstreet, to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army. War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee [...] "acted, probably, under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable. If such was the case, he committed an error, such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into." [...] Lee himself concurred with this judgment, writing to President Davis, [...] "No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me, nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public—I <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> to blame, in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} if writing is a lonely life for her Erdrich replied, [...] "Strangely, I think it is. I am surrounded by an abundance {{of family and friends}} and yet I <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> with the writing. And that is perfect." [...] Erdrich currently lives in Minnesota.|$|E
2500|$|Pärt {{has said}} of [...] "tintinnabulation": [...] "The complex and many-faceted only confuses me, and I must search for unity. What is it, this one thing, {{and how do}} I find my way to it? Traces of this perfect thing appear in many guises – and {{everything}} that is unimportant falls away. Tintinnabulation is like this. Here I <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> with silence. I have discovered that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a silent beat, or a moment of silence, comforts me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean like}} Simeon Stylites. I mean can't one live with one's wife, and be fond of her: and with one's friends, and enjoy their company: {{and with the}} world and everything, pleasantly: and yet KNOW that one <b>is</b> <b>alone?</b> Essentially, at {{the very core of}} me, alone. Eternally alone. And {{choosing}} to <b>be</b> <b>alone.</b> Not sentimental or LONELY. <b>Alone,</b> choosing to <b>be</b> <b>alone,</b> because by one's own nature one <b>is</b> <b>alone.</b> The being with another person is secondary," [...] said Lilly.|$|R

You can <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> just in that minute when you've broken free, and {{you feel}} heart thankful to <b>be</b> <b>alone,</b> because the other thing wasn't to be borne. But you can't keep on being alone. No matter how many tunes you've broken free, and feel, thank God to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> (nothing on earth is so good as to breathe fresh air and <b>be</b> <b>alone),</b> {{no matter how many}} times you've felt this--it wears off every time, and you begin to look again--and you begin to roam round. And even if you won't admit it to {{yourself}}, still you are seeking--seeking. Aren't you? Aren't you yourself seeking?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Mid-1990s emo was {{embodied}} by Mineral, whose The Power of Failing (1997) and EndSerenading (1998) encapsulated emo tropes: somber music, {{accompanied by a}} shy narrator singing seriously about mundane problems. Greenwald calls [...] "If I Could" [...] "the ultimate expression of mid-nineties emo. The song's short synopsis—she is beautiful, I am weak, dumb, and shy; I <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> but am surprisingly poetic when left alone—sums up everything that emo's adherents admired and its detractors detested." [...] Another significant band was Braid, whose 1998 album Frame and Canvas and B-side song [...] "Forever Got Shorter" [...] blurred the line between band and listener; the group mirrored their audience in passion and sentiment, and sang in their fans' voice.|$|E
2500|$|Charles II was coldly {{received}} in Parma, {{a country and}} people {{he did not know}} well. He lacked the character and political acumen to be able to overcome a situation far more complicated than the one he had left behind in the much smaller Duchy of Lucca. Parma was dominated by Austria and he was not free to follow his own political ideas. He wrote to Ward. [...] "It is better to die than to live like this. During the day, and when I <b>am</b> <b>alone</b> and can weep I weep. But that does not help." [...] He lacked the support of his cousins in Madrid and in Paris, even though he went in 1852 to Spain to recognize his cousin Isabella II as the legitimate Queen. In France Charles X had lost his throne in the 1830 revolution. He was a virtually prisoner in the palace and wanted to abdicate.|$|E
2500|$|Eve and Fred {{arrive with}} Mrs. Van Brugh, {{and the young}} couple {{go out to the}} garden together. Mrs. Van Brugh confesses to Smailey that she {{believes}} that a flaw in the will may have left her penniless. Smailey reveals that he knows this and accuses her of being part of wilful bigamy with her [...] "husband", as his first wife died after Mrs. Van Brugh married him. She tearfully confesses that she had never married him, but merely lived with him as his wife. Smailey is shocked at this and leaps to the attack, insisting, despite her pleas for mercy, that he [...] "will spare her nothing" [...] and that she must confess all, even to her own daughter. She pleads with him, offering to sign any deed he asks, to spare her the shame, but he holds a public announcement of her acts over her head if she does not submit to his will. She pleads further, holding up all her good deeds as evidence of her atonement. Smailey retorts that all her good works spring from her desire for forgiveness and taunts her with her previous criticisms of his own hard-heartedness. She cries [...] "enough", and, rallying, takes the shame onto herself in her own terms: [...] "So let it be. You are strong – for you have the world on your side. I am weak – for I <b>am</b> <b>alone.</b> If I am to die this moral death, it shall be by my own hand." [...] She calls everyone to her, asks Eve to kiss her once more before the truth is revealed, then confesses all. Eve faints into Ted's arms. Ruth recoils, and Smailey and Fred watch, emotionless.|$|E
