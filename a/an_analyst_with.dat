500|$|The {{announcement}} of Microsoft Security Essentials affected {{the stocks of}} AV vendors. On 19 November 2008, after Microsoft announced codename Morro, Symantec and McAfee shares fell 9.44 and 6.62 percent respectively. On 10 June 2009, after announcing an upcoming beta version, Microsoft shares rose 2.1 percent. Symantec and McAfee shares, however, fell 0.5 and 1.3 percent respectively. Daniel Ives, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> FBR Capital Markets, said that Microsoft Security Essentials would be a [...] "long-term competitive threat", although near-term impact would be negligible.|$|E
500|$|In Beni Suef, {{south of}} Cairo, 17 protesters {{were killed by}} police as the protesters {{attempted}} to attack two police stations. In Abu Zabaal prison in Cairo, eight people were killed as police clashed with inmates trying to escape. According to a Reuters tally, these unconfirmed deaths brought the death toll to at least 100. Several Islamist terrorists and others escaped. Prison overcrowding and police brutality were voiced {{by many of the}} protesters. Emad Gad, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, said that he had obtained information from a trustworthy source that [...] "there have been orders from the very top to free known felons from the prisons, to arm them and to let them mingle with protesters." [...] Two Egyptian policemen jailed following the death of anti-corruption activist Khaled Said were among the hundreds of prisoners that escaped in Cairo that day.|$|E

500|$|Digital rights advocates, {{including}} the Free Software Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, {{have criticized the}} iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, [...] "With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [...] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you." [...] But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart {{the feeling of a}} safe neighborhood, saying, [...] "Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too." [...] Laura Sydell, the article's author, concludes, [...] "As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community." [...] The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a conference}} on 15 June, Morsi called for foreign {{intervention}} in Syria. According to Yasser El-Shimy, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> the International Crisis Group, this statement crossed [...] "a national security red line." [...] The army rebuked this statement the next day by stating that its only role was to guard Egypt's borders. Although the Egyptian constitution ostensibly declares the president as the supreme commander of the armed forces, the Egyptian military is independent of civilian control.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many years}} {{there was a}} {{consensus}} within the electric utilities in the U.S. that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they {{will never be able}} to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power. Thomas Petersnik, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> the U.S. Energy Information Administration put it this way: [...] "by and large, renewable energy sources are too rare, too distant, too uncertain, and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need".|$|E

2500|$|With the new {{features}} of Vista, criticism has surfaced concerning {{the use of}} battery power in laptops running Vista, which can drain the battery much more rapidly than Windows XP, reducing battery life. With the Windows Aero visual effects turned off, battery life is equal to or better than Windows XP systems. [...] "With {{the release of a}} new operating system and its {{new features}} and higher requirements, higher power consumption is normal", as Richard Shim, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> IDC noted, [...] "when Windows XP came out, that was true, and when Windows 2000 came out, that was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Plumeri {{worked on}} the post-merger {{integration}} of the two companies, and was appointed CEO of Citibank North America by Weill and Reed. He oversaw its network of 450 retail branches. [...] J. Paul Newsome, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> CIBC Oppenheimer, said: [...] "He's not the spit-and-polish executive many people expected. He's rough on the edges. But Citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it can't get away anymore with passive selling—and Plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank." [...] Investment News speculated that a successful tenure at Citibank {{might lead to a}} promotion to head up all of Citicorp. Plumeri boosted the unit's earnings from $108 million to $415 million in one year, an increase of nearly 300%. [...] He unexpectedly retired from Citibank, however, in January 2000.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2014, the {{low-cost}} BlackBerry Z3 {{was introduced}} onto the Indonesian market, where the brand had been particularly popular. The budget handset {{was produced in}} partnership with Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group, which handled the design and distribution of the product. A New York Times analysis stated that the model was an attempt by Chen to generate revenue while he tried [...] "to shift the organization’s focus to services and software." [...] <b>An</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> London's ABI Research said: [...] "John Chen is just sustaining the handset business as he sorts out the way ahead." [...] As part of the localization effort {{for the promotion of}} the Z3, the handset's back panel was engraved with the word [...] "Jakarta", but skepticism still emerged, as the handset was still more than twice as expensive as Android models in Indonesia at the time of release.|$|E

2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> the agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because {{he did not believe}} it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by {{trying to get me to}} stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{exhibits}} of {{food are}} especially remarkable. We cleaned the glass case with our sleeves and {{peered at the}} most appetising revelations. There are dozens of little bottles hermetically sealed, containing such curios as a sample of [...] "Bacon Common (Gammon) Uncooked," [...] and then the same cooked--it looked no nicer cooked--Irish sausage, pork sausage, black pudding, Welsh mutton, {{and all kinds of}} rare and exquisite feeding. There are ever so many cases of this kind of thing. We saw, for instance, further along, several good specimens of the common oyster shell (Ostrea edulis), cockle shells, and whelks, both [...] "almonds" [...] and [...] "whites," [...] and then came breadstuffs. The breadstuffs are particularly impressive, of a grey, scientific aspect, a hard, hoary antiquity. We always knew that stale bread was good for one, but yet the Parkes Museum startled us with the antique pattern it recommended. There was a muffin, too, identified and labelled, but without any Latin name, a captured crumpet, a collection of buns, a dinner-roll, and a something novel to us, called Pumpernickel, that we had rather be without, or rather--for the expression is ambiguous--that we had rather not be without, but altogether remote from. And all these things have been tested by <b>an</b> <b>analyst,</b> <b>with</b> the most painful results. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and the like nasty chemical things seem indeed to have occurred in everything he touched. Those sturdy mendicants who go about complaining that they cannot get food should visit this Parkes Museum and see what food is really like, and learn contentment with their lot.|$|E
