40|$|Hydrogels are {{a unique}} class of {{polymers}} which swell, {{but do not}} dissolve in water. A range of 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate based copolymer hydrogels have been synthesised and are described in this thesis. Initially, hydrogels were synthesised containing <b>acryloylmorpholine,</b> N,N-dimethyl acrylamide and N-vinyl pyrrolidone. Variations in structure and composition have been correlated with the sequence distribution, equilibrium water content (EWC), mechanical and surface properties of the hydrogels. The sequence distribution {{was found to be}} dependant on the structure and reactivity of the monomers. The EWC was found to be dependant on the water structuring groups present in the hydrogel, although the water binding abilities were modified by steric effects. The mechanical properties were also investigated and were found to be dependant on the monomer structure, sequence distribution and the amount and nature of water in the hydrogel. The macroscopic surface properties of the hydrogels were probed using surface energy determinations and were found to be a function of the water content and the hydrogel composition. At a molecular level, surface properties were investigated using an in vitro ocular spoilation model and single protein adhesion studies. The results indicate that the sequence distribution and the polarity of the surface affect the adhesion of biological species. Finally, a range of 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate based copolymer hydrogels containing both charged monomer groups and linear polyethers have been synthesised and described. Although variations in the EWC are observed with the structure of the monomers, it was observed that the EWC increased due to the polar character of the charged monomers and the chain length and hydrophilicity of the polyethers. Investigation of these hydrogel surfaces revealed subtle changes. The molecular surface properties indicate the significance of the effect of charge and molecular mobility of the groups expressed at the hydrogel surface...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} if {{poorly understood}} problem that hydrogels display is {{the tendency of}} these contact lens materials to dehydrate, causing certain complications of the corneal epithelium. However, recent {{studies have indicated that}} the evaporation rate of water from different hydrogel lenses is the same and the severity of conditions such as corneal staining is controlled by the states of water in the material. A study was therefore undertaken which concluded that increased corneal desiccating staining occurred as the proportion of water existing in the bound state decreased. The possibility of using dehydrated hydrogels as packaging materials with desiccating properties has also been investigated. As hydrogels have a high affinity for water they have adequate ability to function as a moisture scavenger in an enclosed atmosphere. It was concluded that this ability is maximised by a high total water content and an increase in the proportion of this water existing in the bound state for the material when it is fully hydrated. N-vinyl pyrrolidone has a low reactivity in vinyl polymerisation reactions which results in polymers with local domains of the same chemical type which can lead to deposition. As contact lenses comprising of this monomer are susceptible to deposition, a monomer with a higher reactivity in vinyl polymerisations is <b>acryloylmorpholine</b> and its incorporation in favour of NVP is encouraged. Unfortunately a large proportion of high EWC hydrogels are mechanically weak and attempts to increase this property by increasing hydrophobicity or cross-linking results in a decrease in EWC. Monomers with the potential to carry a positive charge were incorporated into a high EWC, AMO-HEMA copolymer and the physical properties were investigated. Although EWC increased, mechanical properties decreased only slightly. Therefore simultaneous incorporation of a positively charged monomer and a negatively charged monomer was investigated. The resulting copolymers showed increased water content and increased initial modulus. A technique for measuring the coefficient of friction of contact lenses during lubrication has been developed...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogels may be {{described}} as cross~linked hydrophilic polymers that swell but do not dissolve in water. They have been utilised in many biomedical applications, as there is the potential to manipulate the properties for a given application by changing the chemical structure of the constituent monomers. This project {{is focused on the}} development of novel hydrogels for keratoprosthesis (KPro). The most commonly used KPro model consists of a tansparent central stem witb a porous peripheral skirt. Clear poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) core material used in the Strampelli KPros prosthesis has not been the cause of failure found in other core and skirt prostheses. However, epithelialization of this kind of solid, rigid optic material is clearly impossible. The approach {{to the development of a}} hydrogeJ for potential KPro use adopted in this work is to develop soft core material to mimic the properties of the natural cornea by incorporating some hydrophilic monomers such as N, N-dimethyacrylamide (NNSMA) N~vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) and <b>acryloylmorpholine</b> (AMO) with methyl methactylate (MMA). Most of these materials have been used in other ophthalmic applications, such as contact lens. However, an unavoidable limitation of simple. MMA copolymers as conventional hydrogels is poor mechanical strength. The hydrogel for use in this application must be able to withstand the stresses involved during the surgical procedure involved with KPro surgery and the in situ stresses such as the deforming force of the eyelid during the blink cycle. Thus, semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) based on ester polyurethane, AMO, NVP and NNDMA were examined in this work and were found to have much improved mechanical properties at water contents between 40 % and 70 %. Polyethylene glycol monomethacrylate (PEG MA) was successfully incorporated in order to modulate protein deposition and cell adhesion. Porous peripheral skirts were fabricated using different types of porosigen. The water content mechanical properties, surface properties and cell response of these various materials have been investigated in this thesis. These studies demonstrated that simple hydrogel SIPNs which show isotropic mechanical behaviour, are not ideal KPro materials since they do not mimic the anisotropic behaviour of natural cornea. The final stage of the work has concentrated on the study of hydrogels reinforced with mesh materials. They offer a promising approach to making a hydrogel that is very flexible but strong under tension, thereby having mechanical properties closer to the natural cornea than has been previously possible...|$|E
40|$|Crystallization is a {{commonly}} used purification process in industrial practice. It usually begins with heterogeneous nucleation on a foreign surface. The complicated mechanism of heterogeneous nucleation {{is not well}} understood, but we hypothesize a possible correlation between binding affinity to a surface and nucleation enhancement. Amorphous polymers {{have been used in}} controlling crystallization. However, to our knowledge no attempt has been made to investigate the possibility of using binding affinity to help guide the selection of polymers promoting heterogeneous nucleation. This study investigated the possibility of using binding affinity of one molecule and many molecules to help guide the selection of these polymers. To measure the binding affinity of one molecule, we developed a two-step approach to compute the free energy of binding to a binding site, using a system of ethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and heavy water (D 20). The first step of our approach uses Adsorption Locator to identify probable binding sites and molecular dynamics to screen for the best binding sites. The second step employs the Blue-Moon Ensemble method to compute the free energy of binding. We then applied our procedure to the systems of aspirin binding on the surfaces of four nonporous crosslinked polymers in ethanol-water 38 v%. These polymers are poly(4 - <b>acryloylmorpholine)</b> (PAM), poly(2 -carboxyethyl acrylate) (PCEA), poly(4 -hydroxylbutyl acrylate) (PHBA), and polystyrene (PS), and they all are crosslinked with divinylbenzene (DVB). We developed an approach to construct these crosslinked polymers and built three independent surfaces for each polymer. We found the similarity between the trend of heterogeneous nucleation activity and that of the average free energies of binding to the best site of each polymer surface. To measure the binding affinity of many molecules, preferential interaction coefficient and the number of aspirin molecules associated with the area of the binding site was calculated. We found that there is also a similarity between the trend of heterogeneous nucleation activity and that of number of aspirin molecules associated with the area of the binding site (taken into account the effects of polar/apolar atom interactions between an aspirin and a polymer). These results suggest the possibility of using binding affinity, especially the free energy of binding to the best site and the number of nucleating molecule, to help guide the selection of polymers promoting heterogeneous nucleation. by Surasak Chunsrivirot.
