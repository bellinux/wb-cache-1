40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{solutions}} to the quadratic gradient wind equation are examined using 200 -mb data for two selected cases. Under conditions of anticyclonic flow, both solutions are shown to have relevance. The normal solution is valid for wind speeds less than twice geostrophic, whereas the "anomalous " solution applies for wind speeds greater than twice the geostrophic value. For both cases, wind speeds of {{more than three times}} the geostrophic value were detected synoptically over large areas of the United States. Areas of negative absolute vorticity were generally found within the <b>anomalous</b> <b>flow</b> regions. The absolute value of the absolute vorticity approached zhe local value of the Coriolis parameter. Although cause-effect relationships are difficult to ascertain, the coexistence of negative absolute vorticity and <b>anomalous</b> <b>flow</b> implies stability.

This theory has a foundation in the early estimates of the crystallographic anisotropy of antiphase boundary (APB) energy in these compounds. In spite of this critical aspect of the theory, {{it is only in}} the last five years that electron microscopy has been employed to quantify the APB energies and to determine the detailed nature of dislocation structures at each stage of deformation. The recent studies of several research groups have provided essentially consistent new details about the nature of dislocations in Ni 3 AI and a few other LI 2 compounds which exhibit <b>anomalous</b> <b>flow</b> behavior. These studies have introduced several new concepts for the controlling dislocation mechanisms. Additionally, these studies have shown that in Ni 3 AI, the APB energies have only small variations in magnitude with change of the APB plane (they are nearly isotropic), are relatively insensitive to changes in solute content, and the anisotropy ratio does not correlate with alloy strength.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} {{studies on the}} role of the mean state in modulating climate variability at interannual and decadal time scales. In the atmosphere, the nonlinear superposition of mean flow and <b>anomalous</b> <b>flow</b> has important implications for many phenomena associated with variables that are nonlinear by definition, such as the vertical wind shear and surface wind speed. In the first part of this dissertation, the influence of mean flow and <b>anomalous</b> <b>flow</b> on vertical wind shear variability is studied in observations and numerical model simulations. At interannual timescales, the ENSO-shear relationship is compared between observations and numerical model simulations. It is shown that there is strong influence of mean flow on the ENSO-shear relationship. For same <b>anomalous</b> <b>flow,</b> different mean flows could give rise to a different ENSO-shear relationship. The nonlinear superposition of mean flow and <b>anomalous</b> <b>flow</b> also helps explains the dipole mode of tropical Atlantic vertical wind shear variability seen in observations and models, which implies opposite variation of vertical wind shear over the two sides of the tropical Atlantic. This has important implications for predicting phenomena such as Atlantic hurricanes, whose variations are modulated by vertical shear variability. The dissertation also addresses the role of the mean surface wind in decadal variability and predictability, as manifested through the Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback. The nonlinear superposition of anomalous surface wind on the mean trade wind can give rise to a positive WES feedback, which can amplify tropical climate variability. To study this feedback, we carried out ensembles of decadal climate predictions using the CAM 3 atmospheric model coupled to a slab ocean model (CAM 3 - SOM) with prescribed ocean transport and simple extrapolative prescriptions of future external forcings. Mechansitic sensitivity runs using the CAM 3 -SOM were also carried out, where the WES feedback was switched off by prescribing climatological surface wind. Results suggest that switching off the WES feedback enhances the prediction skill over some regions, especially over the eastern tropical Pacific, by increasing the signal- to-noise ratio. To address the issue of cold bias noted in the decadal prediction experiments, we carried out additional sensitivity experiments where we used an adaptive formulation for the prescribed oceanic heat transport (Q-flux) in the slab ocean. The results from these experiments demonstrate that the mean oceanic heat transport plays a crucial role in influencing decadal predictability, by helping improve predictions of the trend component of decadal variations...|$|E

40|$|The western {{equatorial}} Pacific Ocean El Niño signal leaks {{through the}} gappy western equatorial Pacific Ocean boundary {{to the western}} and southern coasts of Australia. Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX) /Poseidon sea level data and coastal tide gauge measurements show that off the northwest coast the low-frequency signal propagates westward as large-scale Rossby waves. However, along the nearly zonal southern coast, particle displacements are nearly zonal near the coast and experience no planetary vorticity change. As a consequence, the Rossby wave mechanism fails, and theory suggests that the signal should decay from the shelf edge with baroclinic Rossby radius-of-deformation scale. High-resolution along-track TOPEX/Poseidon sea level heights show that the interannual height signal does decay rapidly seaward of the shelf edge with this scale. The sharp fall in sea level and geostrophic balance imply strong (; 10 cm s 21) low-frequency currents seaward of the shelf edge.

In subsonic air flow DC discharge or Dielectric Barrier Discharge are used to produce “ionic wind”. This momentum is used to modify characteristics of the air flow (Moreau et al.).

This energy addition to the flow results in an increase in the local sound speed that leads to expected modifications of the flow (Bletzinger et al.). Nevertheless some experiments have shown some <b>anomalous</b> <b>flows</b> around the body and anomalous shock waves structures in cold plasma.
