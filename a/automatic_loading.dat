25|$|Small {{numbers of}} Lee–Enfield rifles were built as, or {{converted}} to, experimental <b>automatic</b> <b>loading</b> systems, {{such as the}} British Howell and South African Rieder and the best-known {{of which was the}} Charlton Automatic Rifle, designed by a New Zealander, Philip Charlton in 1941 to act as a substitute for the Bren and Lewis gun light machine guns which were in chronically short supply at the time. During the Second World War, the majority of New Zealand's land forces were deployed in North Africa. When Japan entered the war in 1941, New Zealand found itself lacking the light machine guns that would be required for local defence should Japan choose to invade, and so the New Zealand Government funded the development of self-loading conversions for the Lee–Enfield rifle. The end result was the Charlton Automatic Rifle (based on the obsolete MLE), which was issued to Home Guard units in NZ from 1942. Over 1,500 conversions were made, including a handful by Electrolux using Lithgow SMLE Mk III* rifles.|$|E

The new vehicle {{was based on the}} new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were {{similar to that of the}} German Panther tank, which had been used by the French Army in the immediate post-war. The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier Tiger I; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach [...] engine, based on an earlier model, and the torsion bar sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an oscillating turret, mounted on trunnions, which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the <b>automatic</b> <b>loading</b> system. Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX's first prototype was armed with a [...] cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger [...] gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the Western European Union, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a heavy tank project with an even larger [...] tank gun; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical formulation for frictional contact {{problems associated with}} pile penetration. The frictional contact at the soil–pile interface is formulated using the theory of hardening/softening plasticity, so that advanced models for the interface can be dealt with. A smooth discretisation of the pile surface is proposed using BéZIER polynomials. An <b>automatic</b> <b>load</b> stepping scheme is proposed,which features an error control algorithm and automatic subincrementation of the load increments. The numerical algorithms are then used to analyse the installation process of pushed-in axial piles. It is shown that the smooth discretisation of the pile surface is effective in reducing the oscillation in the predicted pile resistances and the <b>automatic</b> <b>load</b> stepping scheme outperforms the classical Newton–Raphson scheme {{for this type of}} problem...|$|R

Interfaces for strategy objects allow easy implementation of novel load balancing strategies that could use application characteristics on the entire machine, or only a local neighborhood.

40|$|The {{operation}} of a helicopter with an externally slung load is highly demanding for the flight crew. Without having a direct view on the load, the pilot needs assistance by a crew member for load handling, e. g. load positioning. During Helicopter Hoist Operations (HHO), the hoist operator gives instructions to the pilot and stabilizes the <b>load</b> motion. An <b>automatic</b> <b>load</b> positioning system for HHO is designed with the aim to reduce the workload of the flight crew and to improve the load handling performance. The control system consists of a multi-loop architecture that is designed using multi-objective optimization. The system was designed to achieve best performance in load positioning for the entire cable length range of the rescue hoist. Load positioning performance {{is a function of}} the cable length; faster <b>automatic</b> <b>load</b> positioning can be achieved with shorter cable lengths.
