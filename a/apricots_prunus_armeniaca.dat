There is no information on the correct harvest maturity stage that should be chosen to ensure a long post-harvest life and high sensory quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of maturity stage at harvest on the sensory quality of ‘Palsteyn’ apricots after 14, 28, or 42 d in cold storage. Sourness, flavour, and acceptability showed major changes during cold storage. Ripe fruit (orange-yellow skin colour) showed the highest acceptability, as assessed by a “mini-consumer test” (i. e., an untrained panel; n = 36). Fruit harvested at an intermediate stage of maturity (light yellow skin colour) reached an average acceptability, while unripe fruit (greenish skin colour) were not acceptable. After 28 d of cold storage, fruits were still acceptable; but, after 42 d, fruits reached the “dislike” zone. On a principal component analysis, acceptability was shown to be positively associated with sweetness, flavour, juiciness, and aroma, and negatively associated with sourness. After 28 d and 42 d of cold storage, unripe fruit appeared to have low acceptability and quality attributes. ‘Palsteyn’ apricot harvested with an orangeyellow skin colour, as the least ripe fruits, showed that they could reach high sensory quality standards and were able to withstand long periods of cold storage...|$|E

Maturity at harvest significantly affected flesh firmness and other quality factors. Mealiness and gel formation only developed in fruit that had been stored at low (0 é temperatures. Mealiness did not develop until firmness dropped below approximately 20 N, whereas gel formation began to develop when firmness was as high as 35 N. Development of mealiness and loss of juiciness were correlated; however, slight mealiness was perceived when fruit were still considered juicy. Specific cultivar-related differences were evident in the changes in firmness and development of gel formation during and after cold storage. Fruit were less liked by the sensory panel when firmness dropped below 20 N, as juiciness decreased and mealiness and gel formation increased. Cell wall studies showed changes in yields of water-soluble and CDTA (trans- 1, 2 -cyclohexanediamine tetraacetic acid) -soluble pectin. In fruit ripened after cold storage, mealiness and gel formation was accompanied {{by an increase in}} water-soluble pectin and an increase in CDTA-soluble pectin, whereas in apricots ripened straight after harvest, water-soluble pectin increased but CDTA-soluble pectin slightly decreased. All fruit, regardless of maturity or having chilling disorders or not, fitted the same correlation between firmness and uronic acid content of water-soluble pectin, but no pattern was evident for CDTA-soluble pectin. We concluded that the increasing solubilisation of pectin was a major feature of fruit softening in apricot, whereas the differences in CDTA-soluble pectin may reflect differences in strength of cell adhesion.
