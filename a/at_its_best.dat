An ongoing {{initiative}} is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E

25|$|Nussbaum's work on {{capabilities}} {{has often}} {{focused on the}} unequal freedoms and opportunities of women, and she has developed a distinctive type of feminism, drawing inspiration from the liberal tradition, but emphasizing that liberalism, <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best,</b> entails radical rethinking of gender relations and relations within the family.|$|E

25|$|Claude Piron {{writes that}} machine translation, <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best,</b> automates the easier {{part of a}} translator's job; the harder and more {{time-consuming}} part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text, which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved. Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing {{necessary in order to}} provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be meaningless.|$|E
25|$|The nightlife in Madrid {{is one of}} the city's main attractions. Tapas bars, {{cocktail}} bars, clubs, jazz lounges, {{live music}} venues, flamenco theatres, and establishments of all kinds cater to all.

25|$|Another {{competing}} view is {{that the}} saw functions <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best</b> when the angle of the blade teeth arc relative to the top surface of the workpiece is as extreme as possible. This facilitates chip ejection, shortens the overall distance through which the teeth act on the part, reduces power consumption and heat generation, substantially reduces the peak pushing force required, thus improving control, and causes the blade's force on the wood to act mostly downward rather than largely horizontally.|$|E

It does not mark the start of philanthropy as a solution to public insolvency. This is a unique, clear-eyed move to push forward positive negotiations, with our philanthropic dollars being exclusively pegged for two roles: safeguarding the DIA and protecting pensions.|$|E

25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works. While it has been criticized as the least {{substantial}} of the composer's three ballets, {{it should be remembered}} that Tchaikovsky was restricted by a rigorous scenario supplied by Marius Petipa. This scenario provided no opportunity for the expression of human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best,</b> the melodies are charming and pretty, and by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E
25|$|Niclot was {{the only}} pilot capable of flying this machine <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best</b> (and only in the racer version which was much lighter), while the average pilot was not capable of using it effectively. Despite its {{impressive}} world records and aggressive, slim shape, the Ba.88 was a failure and unable to undertake combat missions. Its structure was too heavy, wing loading too high, and the engines were quite unreliable with insufficient power. The Piaggio P.XI was quite powerful, but never reliable, leading also to the overall failure of the Reggiane Re.2000. (Hungary substituted the engines with similar ones for the first license-produced examples).|$|E
25|$|The {{lines of}} foliage treatment, so {{common in the}} bands of the 15th-century roodscreens and the panel work {{especially}} of Germany, serve to illustrate the widely different motives of the craftsmen of these two great epochs. Again, while the Renaissance designer as a rule made {{the two sides of}} the panel alike, the Gothic carver seldom repeated a single detail. While his main lines and grouping corresponded, his detail differed. Of numberless examples a 15th-century chest (Plate III. fig. 6) in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin may be referred to. The arrangements of foliage, etc., on top, back and front, are typical of Gothic <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, Thom Jurek notes that [...] "this hour-long work is <b>at</b> <b>its</b> {{absolute}} <b>best</b> when {{taken as a}} whole.

5000|$|Shockabilly—March 1985: Dr. Eugene Chadbourne, future Shimmy Disc {{impresario}} Kramer {{and drummer}} Licht. Scott gets {{a lesson in}} playing the electric garden rake.

25|$|During complex situations, {{communication}} between health professionals must be <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best.</b> There are several techniques, tools, and strategies {{used to improve}} communication. Any team should have a clear purpose and each member {{should be aware of}} their role and be involved accordingly. To increase the quality of {{communication between}} people involved, regular feedback should be provided. Strategies such as briefings allow the team to be set on their purpose and ensure that members not only share the goal but also the process they will follow to achieve it. Briefings reduce interruptions, prevent delays and build stronger relationships, resulting in a strong patient safety environment.|$|E
25|$|Burnett {{continued}} {{in his role}} as Inspector-General of the RAF until 1940 when he was appointed Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Australian Air Force. Burnett's appointment to the senior post in the RAAF was not without controversy. Apart from the fact that by 1940 Burnett was due for retirement and his health was not <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>best,</b> the choice of a British officer over an Australian one caused open resentment in many quarters of the RAAF. The Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, had decided that a British officer should head the RAAF, believing that Australian officers lacked the necessary experience. After discussions between the British and Australian governments, Burnett was selected and given an acting promotion to air chief marshal, a rank he subsequently retained.|$|E

5000|$|The Summa Philosophiæ Aristotelico-Thomisticæ (The Sum of Aritotelico-Thomistic Philosophy) - Pirotta {{planned to}} publish six volumes to {{complete}} this work. Unfortunately, he only succeeded in publishing just the first two. The other four volumes remained manuscripts in different phases of preparation. Undoubtedly, the works of this large-scale project represent Pirotta’s philosophical prowess <b>at</b> <b>its</b> very <b>best.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jordan used {{an updated}} EJ15B chassis {{for the final}} five races of the year. Monteiro gave the B spec chassis its debut in Italy whilst Karthikeyan still had the {{previous}} model.
