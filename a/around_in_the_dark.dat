40|$|This {{collection}} of poems, The Missing Lamp, might better be called nothing, or No Nothing, as this poet often {{vowed not to}} write about anything he knew, yet just as often he found himself walking down Westwood Blvd. under the artificial day of the LA streetlights and taking note of surreal coincidences––the friends that slipped into his poems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of shadows, the uncanny resemblance between his laugh and the mechanical cackle of Alfred Jarry’s baboon.

They led him to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a fictional ‘pataphysical poet named Julien Torma, to meditate on madness and homelessness, to consider the pointlessness of boring day jobs and the creation of the world, to hypothesize that Paradise is nothing more than an Alpine resort where you’re snowed in and alone...

40|$|The {{unicellular}} Cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, grown under alternating 12 -h light/ 12 -h dark conditions, temporally separated N 2 fixation from photosynthesis. The {{regulation of}} photosynthesis was studied using fluorescence spectra and kinetics to determine changes in state transitions and photosystem organization. The redox poise of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool {{appeared to be}} central to this regulation. Respiration supported N 2 fixation by oxidizing carbohydrate granules, but reduced the PQ pool. This induced state 2 photosystem II monomers and lowered the capacity for O 2 evolution. State 2 favored photosystem I trimers and cyclic electron transport, which could stimulate N 2 fixation; the stimulation suggested an ATP limitation to N 2 and CO 2 fixation. The exhaustion of carbohydrate granules at <b>around</b> 6 h <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> resulted <b>in</b> reduced respiratory electron flow, {{which led to a}} more oxidized PQ pool and produced a sharp transition from state 2 to state 1. This transient state 1 returned to state 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining hours of darkness. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> light phase, photosystem II dimerization correlated with increased phycobilisome coupling to photosystem II (state 1) and increased rates of O 2 evolution.

40|$|Rats {{can readily}} {{be trained to}} jump a gap of <b>around</b> 16 cm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> and a {{considerably}} larger gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light for a food reward. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> light, they use vision to estimate the distance to be jumped. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> they use their vibrissae at the farthest distances. Bilateral whisker shaving or barrel field lesions reduce <b>the</b> gap crossed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> by about 2 cm. Information from the barrel fields reaches motor areas via cortico-cortical, basal ganglia, or cerebellar pathways. The cells of origin of the ponto-cerebellar pathway are segregated in layer Vb of the barrel field. Efferent axons of Vb cells occupy a central position within the basis pedunculi and terminate on cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pontine nuclei. Pontine cells, in turn, project to the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers. We trained normal rats to cross a gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light and <b>in</b> a dark alley that was illuminated with an infra-red source. When the performance was stable, we made unilateral lesions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central region of the basis pedunculi, which interrupted connections from the barrel field to the pons while leaving cortico-cortical and basal ganglia pathways intact. Whisking was not affected on either side by the lesion, and the rats with unilateral peduncle lesions crossed gaps of the same distance as they did pre-operatively. Shaving the whiskers {{on the side of}} the face that retains its input to the pontine nuclei reduced the maximal gap jumped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> by <b>the</b> same amount as bilateral whisker shaving. Performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light was not affected.

40|$|Pheromonal {{communication}} {{is the most}} convenient way to transfer information regarding gender and social status <b>in</b> animals of <b>the</b> same species with the holistic goal of sustaining reproduction. This type of information exchange is based on pheromones, molecules often chemically unrelated, that are contained in body fluids like urine, sweat, specialized exocrine glands, and mucous secretions of genitals. So profound is the relevance of pheromones over the evolutionary process that a specific peripheral organ devoted to their recognition, namely the vomeronasal organ of Jacobson, and a related central pathway arose in most vertebrate species. Although the vomeronasal system is well developed in reptiles and amphibians, most mammals strongly rely on pheromonal communication. Humans use pheromones too; evidence {{on the existence of}} a specialized organ for their detection, however, is very elusive indeed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present review, we will focus our attention on the behavioral, physiological, and molecular aspects of pheromone detection in mammals. We will discuss the responses to pheromonal stimulation in different animal species, emphasizing the complicacy of this type of communication. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> light of the most recent results, we will also discuss the complex organization of the transduction molecules that underlie pheromone detection and signal transmission from vomeronasal neurons to the higher centers of the brain. Communication is a primary feature of living organisms, allowing the coordination of different behavioral paradigms among individuals. Communication has evolved through a variety of different strategies, and each species refined its own preferred communication medium. From a phylogenetic point of view, the most widespread and ancient way of {{communication is}} through chemical signals named pheromones: it occurs in all taxa, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The release of specific pheromones into the environment is a sensitive and definite way to send messages to other members of the same species. Therefore, the action of an organism can alter the behavior of another organism, thereby increasing the fitness of either or both. Albeit slow in transmission and not easily modulated, pheromones can travel <b>around</b> objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> and over long distances. In addition, they are emitted when necessary and their biosynthesis is usually economic. In essence, they represent the most efficient tool to refine the pattern of social behaviors and reproductive strategies...|$|R
