50|$|Butterfly clutch - One of {{the most}} popular modern methods of <b>attaching</b> <b>pins</b> is the {{butterfly}} clutch, sometimes called a military clutch. The back of the pin has a small prong attached and when the butterfly clutch is squeezed and pulled up from the prong the pin is released from the clutch. Butterfly clutches may be made out of metal, plastic, or rubber.|$|R

40|$|Prelaunch oscillatory bending {{deflections}} of the Atlas/Centaur {{launch vehicle}} are restrained by a damper mechanism {{mounted on the}} end of a horizontal boom supported from the umbilical tower. A single vertical pin on the vehicle engages the mechanism, and the damper is connected to the vehicle until liftoff. As the <b>attach</b> <b>pin</b> rises with the vehicle, a retractable arm mechanism provides initial clearance. An explosive release mechanism allows the boom to swing clear of the vehicle like a pendulum, while a snubber mechanism decelerates the free swinging boom and damper mechanism to a safe stop...|$|R
50|$|The flat cap, Irish walking hat, deerstalker and trilby hat {{are some}} {{traditional}} forms of headwear used in the country. But some people will sometimes choose a non-traditional style of hat, depending on weather conditions, social circumstances and the activity. The flat cap is often made of tweed or cotton, whilst a trilby hat is traditionally made from felt material. For a trilby hat, a feather <b>attached</b> <b>pin</b> on the side is a traditional accessory {{for both men and}} women which can also optionally be attached a jacket lapel.|$|R

5000|$|All berets in the Israel Defense Forces, {{other than}} general corps berets (when worn by recruits), have <b>pins</b> <b>attached</b> to their front, which {{represent}} {{the symbol of}} the corps. While soldiers may wear the beret of another corps due to serving at that corps' base, they will always wear the pin of their native corps. Each pin consists of the corps symbol as well as a certain ornament which also contains the name of the corps. Soldiers serving a term in military prison must wear a blank beret with no <b>pins</b> <b>attached.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Risdon Manufacturing Company, {{established}} in Naugatuck around 1910, began by producing safety pins. Local housewives {{and children were}} often hired to <b>attach</b> the <b>pins</b> to cardboard for easy sale. Risdon became the manufacturer of total packaging for cosmetics, personal, household and other consumer products and home sewing notions such as common pins, needles, snaps and other accessories.

50|$|The Christmas {{tree was}} adopted in upper-class homes in 18th-century Germany, {{where it was}} {{occasionally}} decorated with candles, {{which at the time}} was a comparatively expensive light source. Candles for the tree were glued with melted wax to a tree branch or <b>attached</b> by <b>pins.</b> Around 1890, candleholders were first used for Christmas candles. Between 1902 and 1914, small lanterns and glass balls to hold the candles started to be used. Early electric Christmas lights were introduced with electrification, beginning in the 1880s.|$|R

50|$|A hole in an arm {{attached}} to the bottom bracket shell snaps onto a <b>pin</b> <b>attached</b> to the drive side of the lower seat tube (part of the main frame), locking the rear end in place. A <b>pin</b> <b>attached</b> {{to the side of}} the seatmast snaps into a hole in a piece {{attached to}} the non-drive side of the mainframe, locking it in place. Finally, a cap on the end of a screw {{attached to the}} stem slides into a slot on the drive side of the mainframe, securing it. This allows the bike to be picked up as one piece without unfolding and also allows the bike to wheel around by the front wheel, unlike the other Bike Fridays.|$|R
50|$|A typical TAE {{installation}} is a multi-socket {{junction box}} {{with at least}} one N connector and one F connector socket in the box, but having usually two N and one F connector. Up to three N connectors are possible. Network service enters the box and connects to pins 1 and 2 on the right-most N connector. Service is daisy-chained from pins 5 and 6 on the N connector to pins 1 and 2 on the next N connector to the left. The F connector is <b>attached</b> to <b>pins</b> 5 and 6 on the last N connector {{at the end of the}} chain.|$|R
40|$|The {{shoulder}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex systems in the human body. To know how its work is essential to understand the biomechanics of the body. The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of Local Coordinate Systems in the kinematic analysis of GlenoHumeral joint. The motion tracking was performed using passive sensors <b>attached</b> to <b>pins.</b> Trabecular pins were placed on the shoulder and scapula. The data processing was performed using the free open software pyFormex. The joint displacements were determined by two different variants of Coordinate Systems, being detected a difference from 2 to 12 degrees...|$|R

50|$|In {{fixing the}} day of {{matchmaking}} everybody tries to choose the successful day, which should be a day when all dreams come true. According to an ancient belief, evil spirits bordered the matchmakers’ path {{on the way to}} the bride’s house, attempted to restrict the commitment, and wanted the matchmaker to receive a refusal and have to return without consent. To counteract this, people <b>attached</b> a <b>pin</b> to doors and walls of the house, which they approach. Evil spirits, frightened from the pin made of iron, did not have enough courage to leave the home and accompany the matchmaker going to the bride’s house.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} types of wig in Roman times: the full wig, called the capillamentum, and the half wig, called the galerus. The galerus {{could be in the}} form of a fillet of woolen hair used as padding to build an {{elaborate}} style, or as a toupee on the back or front of the head. Toupees were <b>attached</b> by <b>pins,</b> or by sewing the it onto a piece of leather and attaching it as a wig. Further, glue could be used to affix it to the scalp or alternatively, as a bust from the British Museum illustrates, the toupee could be braided into the existing hair.|$|R
50|$|Circuitry <b>attached</b> {{to signal}} <b>pins</b> in a hot-swap {{component}} should include some protection against electrostatic discharge (ESD). This usually {{takes the form}} of clamp diodes to ground and to the DC power supply voltage. ESD effects can be reduced by careful design of the mechanical package around the hot-swap component, perhaps by coating it with a thin film of conductive material.|$|R

50|$|The {{badge of}} a royal family order {{consists}} of {{a portrait of the}} sovereign set in diamonds, which is suspended from a ribbon.

50|$|The double shaft {{mechanism}} has two shafts rotating at constant speeds: one turns once a year, and {{the other}} twice a year.

50|$|HD Audio {{can sense}} the {{presence}} of an audio dongle. A 10 kΩ pull-up resistor is <b>attached</b> to <b>pin</b> 4 (PRESENCE#). When the HDA dongle is plugged in, it pulls pin 4 to ground with a 1 kΩ resistor. The motherboard can determine if the dongle is plugged in by examining the logic level on pin 4. If the motherboard does not detect {{the presence of}} an HDA dongle, then it should ignore SENSE1_RETURN (pin 6) and SENSE2_RETURN (pin 10) signals. In AC'97, pins 2 and 4 are audio ground, but pin 4 is often disconnected. Consequently, an HDA motherboard would not detect {{the presence of an}} AC'97 dongle with a disconnected pin 4.|$|R
