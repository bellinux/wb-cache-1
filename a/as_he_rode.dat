5|$|Private Rafel Toro, from Humacao, Puerto Rico, {{was part}} of the U.S. Marine Corps {{occupation}} force in Nicaragua, serving with the Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua. On July 25, 1927, Private Toro was assigned to advance guard duty in Nueva Segovia. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> into town, he was attacked; returning fire, he was able to hold back the enemy until reinforcements arrived. He was mortally wounded in this action for which he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} reorganization {{during the}} winter of 1863–1864, Walker and the Army of the Potomac fought in the Overland Campaign through May and June 1864. The Battle of Cold Harbor in early June took a substantial toll on the ranks of the II Corps and Walker injured his knee during the battle. In the ensuing Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, Walker was appointed a brevet colonel. However, on August 25, 1864, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> to find Maj. Gen. John Gibbon at the front during the Second Battle of Ream's Station, Walker was surrounded and captured by the 11th Georgia Infantry. On August 27, Walker was able to escape from a marching prisoner column with another prisoner but was recaptured by the 51st North Carolina Infantry after trying to swim across the Appomattox River and nearly drowning. After being held as a prisoner in Petersburg, he was transferred to the infamous Libby Prison in Richmond, where his older brother was also held. In October 1864, Walker was released with thirty other prisoners as a part of an exchange.|$|E

He {{recalled}} Percival Parry Jones, a history master from his days at Sherborne School who, upon seeing the young Messiter daydreaming in a class, instructed him to repeat everything he had said in the previous minute without hesitation or repetition. To this, Messiter added a rule disallowing players from deviating from the subject, as well as a scoring system based on panellists' challenges.|$|E
25|$|In Book I Thomas {{addresses}} Froude's {{claims in}} the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping generalizations {{about the condition of}} blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he was writing about. Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.|$|E
25|$|The other {{settlers}} {{rushed into}} the cabin as the raiding warriors surrounded the house. They {{shut the door and}} aimed their weapons through cracks in the walls. Two of the men stood near the doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon came into contact with Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E

25|$|King Charles entered Worcester on 8 September, but {{he found}} that {{he could no longer}} expect {{recruits}} from South Wales. Worse was to come. A few hours later, on the night of 9/10 September, Fairfax's army stormed Bristol. Rupert had long realised the hopelessness of further fighting; the very summons to surrender sent in by Fairfax placed the fate of Bristol on the political issue, and the lines of defence around the place were too extensive for his small force. On 10 September he surrendered Bristol on terms. He was escorted to Oxford with his men, conversing <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> with the officers of the escort about peace and the future of his adopted country.|$|E
25|$|On 23 May 1926, {{while riding}} the {{boundary}} of Nulla Nulla station, Fred Hay attacked an Aboriginal {{man by the name}} of Lumbia. Hay flogged Lumbia 20-30 times with his stockwhip and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> off was stabbed in the back with a spear and killed by Lumbia. The reasons for the assaults remain unclear. Several native accounts exist as reported by interpreters. All the various accounts given before Lumbia's trial share a common thread, the rape of one or both of Lumbia's child wives. On hearing of Hay's death Rev Gribble rushed to Wyndham where he swore in Richard Jolly and Bernard O'Leary as special constables under the supervision of Constable Denis Regan and tasked them with finding Hay's killer.|$|E
25|$|Lyde {{travelled}} to Palestine in 1856, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> on {{his horse}} into Nablus he shot and killed a beggar {{who was trying to}} steal his coat. It was either an accidental discharge of the gun or Lyde had lost his nerve and fired. An anti-Christian riot ensued during which Christian houses were burned and several Greeks and Prussians were killed. Lyde took refuge in the town governor's house but was eventually put on trial for murder. The only witnesses were three women who accused him of attacking and deliberately killing the beggar. However, the testimony of women was inadmissible in Ottoman courts and he was acquitted of murder, although he was ordered to pay compensation to the man's family. The violent rioting continued for several months and even spread to Gaza.|$|E

25|$|The Outlaws, {{who have}} around 150 British members across 14 {{chapters}} mainly {{based in the}} West Midlands, have since become the Hells Angels' main rivals in the UK since opening chapters {{in the country in}} 2000. Hells Angels member Gerry Tobin was shot dead <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> his motorcycle home to London, where he worked as a Harley-Davidson service manager, from the Bulldog Bash in Warwickshire on August 12, 2007. Two bullets were fired from a Rover car which drove up alongside him as he sped down the M40 motorway, one hitting him in the head. Seven members of the Outlaws, the entire South Warwickshire chapter, were convicted over his murder and sentenced to a total of 191 years in prison. It is believed that Tobin was killed {{due to the fact that}} the Hells Angels-run Bulldog Bash is held in Outlaws territory, and that the killing may have been sanctioned by Outlaws leadership in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Schaefer served four {{terms as}} mayor, being re-elected in 1975, 1979 and 1983, each time {{receiving}} 85% {{or more of}} the vote. He was known for his attention to detail, taking notes of strewn garbage and other violations <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> around, and ordering them fixed immediately. A famous photograph shows him dressed in an old-fashioned 19th century blue striped bathing suit, with a straw boat hat, carrying a rubber duck into the outside seal pool at the then-new National Aquarium in Baltimore at the Inner Harbor, attracting wide national media attention, to settle a wager {{that it would not be}} opened in time in August 1981. In 1984, in a move to give the majority African-American population more power in the city of Baltimore, Schaefer named Bishop L. Robinson as the Baltimore City Police Department's first African-American police commissioner, a position previously dominated by Irish American and Italian American members of the city police department.|$|E
500|$|Bates {{was born}} at Lapworth in Warwickshire, and became a {{retainer}} to Robert Catesby, who from 1604 planned to kill King James I by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder, and inciting a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne. [...] Bates was {{invited to join the}} conspiracy after he accidentally became aware of it. [...] <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> with Catesby to prepare for the group's planned uprising on 5 November 1605, Guy Fawkes was found guarding the gunpowder stored under the House of Lords and arrested. [...] Bates subsequently accompanied Catesby and his small group of fugitives to Holbeche House in Staffordshire, but left shortly before his master was killed there by government forces on 8 November. [...] He was subsequently captured and taken to London.|$|E

500|$|Breckinridge's men {{initially}} {{broke the}} Union line and forced {{them across the}} river. Artillery {{on the opposite side}} of the river then opened fire on Breckinridge's men, and reinforcements for the fleeing Union troops arrived. In just over an hour, [...] nearly one-third of Breckinridge's troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One anecdote holds that, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, [...] "My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans," [...] bringing recognition to the Orphan Brigade. Bragg's official report criticized the conduct of Breckinridge's division and assigned to Breckinridge most of the blame for the Confederate defeat. Breckinridge asserted to his superiors that Bragg's report [...] "fails... to do justice to the behavior of my Division"; he requested a court of inquiry, but the request was denied. Several Kentuckians under Breckinridge's command, who already blamed Bragg for the failed invasion of their native state, encouraged him to resign his commission and challenge Bragg to a duel.|$|E
500|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} {{the battle of}} Balaclava, {{the remnants of the}} Light Brigade were posted inland, to high ground overseeing the British lines surrounding Inkerman. Cardigan, who had spent most nights of the campaign aboard his luxury yacht Dryad in Balaclava harbour, found this move a great inconvenience and his leadership of the brigade suffered as a result. He missed the Battle of Inkerman (4 and 5 November 1854), casually asking journalist William Russell (who was returning from the conflict) [...] "What are they doing, what was the firing for...?" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> up from the harbour at noon on the first day. The decisive stages of the battle were on the second day and again Cardigan was absent, although he managed to arrive at a more creditable 10.15am. The part played by the brigade was not great and, to avoid embarrassing the earl, it was not mentioned in the official account of the battle forwarded to London.|$|E
500|$|News of Philip's death roused {{many states}} into revolt, {{including}} Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes {{to the north}} of Macedon. When news of the revolts in Greece reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though his advisors advised him to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered the Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 men and rode south towards Thessaly, Macedon's neighbor to the south. When he found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, he had the men ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear, and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>rode</b> down towards the Peloponnesus. Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized {{as the leader of the}} Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. [...] Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and pardoned anyone involved with the uprising. [...] At Corinth, he was given the title Hegemon, and like Philip, appointed commander of the forthcoming war against Persia.|$|E
