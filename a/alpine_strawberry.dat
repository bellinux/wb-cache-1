60|$|The {{path was}} narrow and {{difficult}} in the wood, and especially along {{the bed of the}} stream, where grew ugly trees of larch, eighty feet high, and abundance of a new species of <b>alpine</b> <b>strawberry</b> with oblong fruit. At 11,560 feet elevation, I arrived at an immense rock of gneiss, buried in the forest. Here currant-bushes were plentiful, generally growing on the pine-trunks, in strange association with a small species of Begonia, a hothouse tribe of plants in England. Emerging from the forest, vast old moraines are crossed, in a shallow mountain valley, several miles long and broad, 12,000 feet above the sea, choked with rhododendron shrubs, and nearly encircled by snowy mountains. Magnificent gentians grew here, also Senecio, Corydalis, and the Aconitum luridum (n. sp.), whose root is said to be as virulent as A. ferox and A. Napellus.* [The result of Dr. Thomson's and my examination of the Himplayan aconites (of which there are seven species) is that the one generally known as A. ferox, and which supplies {{a great deal of the}} celebrated poison, is the common A. Napellus of Europe.] The plants were all fully a month behind those of the Lachen valley at the same elevation. Heavy rain fell in the afternoon, and we halted under some rocks: as I had brought no tent, my bed was placed beneath the shelter of one, near which the rest of the party burrowed. I supped off half a yak's kidney, an enormous organ in this animal.|$|E

Rapid and widespread red core infection was observed, which provided good evidence that oospores had survived in soil for this extended period. Site elevation and the distribution of red core infected plants showed a strong correlation, with a higher frequency of infected and dead plants in the lowest areas of the field. The race designation of 18 recovered isolates were determined and AFLP fingerprint patterns of some of these and their single-spore derivatives were analysed. The isolates differed little in race type, and the majority were genetically identical at 433 AFLP loci. Races used to inoculate the site in the 1970 s were recovered. The fingerprints of the single variant isolate matched that of an isolation made by Hickman in the 1950 s, originally used to inoculate the site. Clearly Pff is a very stable and long-lived pathogen able to retain its genetic integrity and lie dormant in soil for many years, ensuring its survival between epidemiologically favourable conditions which occur erratically...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Strawberry plants {{infected}} with June yellows and witches'-broom disease were grown in a mist chamber and treated with varying concentrations of oxytetracycline. Treatment with 50 ppm oxytetracycline produced phytotoxicity effects in strawberries {{infected with}} June yellows. However, treatment with 10 ppm oxytetracycline {{resulted in a}} significant (one percent level) increase in greenness of treated plants as compared to control plants. For strawberries infected with witches'-broom, leaf area measurements for plants treated with 50 ppm oxytetracycline were significantly (one percent level) greater than for controls, when measured seven weeks after treatment. Plants treated with 5 ppm oxytetracycline also had significantly larger (one percent level) leaf area measurements than control plants, when measured 14 weeks after treatment. Whenever measurements were made 16 to 22 weeks after treatment, no significant difference was observed between leaf areas of treated and control plants. Healthy <b>Alpine</b> <b>strawberry</b> plants showed significantly larger leaf area measurements for control plants, when compared to plants treated with 50 ppm and 10 ppm oxytetracycline. This was attributed to phytotoxicity effects of oxytetracycline on the strawberry plants.

6000|$|This {{fruit is}} {{remarkable}} {{on account of}} the number of species which have been cultivated, and from their rapid improvement within the last fifty or sixty years. Let any one compare the fruit of one of the largest varieties exhibited at our Shows with that of the wild wood strawberry, or, which will be a fairer comparison, with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild American Virginian Strawberry, and he will see what prodigies horticulture has effected. (10/100. Most of the largest cultivated strawberries are the descendants of F. grandiflora or chiloensis, and I have seen no account of these forms in their wild state. Methuen's Scarlet (Downing 'Fruits' page 527) has [...] "immense fruit of the largest size," [...] and belongs to the section descended from F. virginiana; and the fruit of this species, as I hear from Prof. A. Gray, is only a little larger than that of F. vesca, or our common wood-strawberry.) The number of varieties has likewise increased in a surprisingly rapid manner. Only three kinds were known in France, in 1746, where this fruit was early cultivated. In 1766 five species had been introduced, the same which are now cultivated, but only five varieties of Fragaria vesca, with some sub-varieties, had been produced. At the present day the varieties of the several species are almost innumerable. The species consist of, firstly, the wood or <b>Alpine</b> cultivated <b>strawberries,</b> descended from F. vesca, a native of Europe and of North America. There are eight wild European varieties, as ranked by Duchesne, of F. vesca, but several of these are considered species by some botanists. Secondly, the green strawberries, descended from the European F. collina, and little cultivated in England. Thirdly, the Hautbois, from the European F. elatior. Fourthly, the Scarlets, descended from F. virginiana, a native of the whole breadth of North America. Fifthly, the Chili, descended from F. chiloensis, an inhabitant of the west coast of the temperate parts both of North and South America. Lastly, the pines or Carolinas (including the old Blacks), which have been ranked by most authors under the name of F. grandiflora as a distinct species, said to inhabit Surinam; but this is a manifest error. This form is considered by the highest authority, M. Gay, to be merely a strongly marked race of F. chiloensis. (10/101. 'Le Fraisier' par le Comte L. de Lambertye 1864 page 50.) These five or six forms have been ranked by most botanists as specifically distinct; but this may be doubted, for Andrew Knight (10/102. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 1820 page 207.) who raised no less than 400 crossed strawberries, asserts that the F. virginiana, chiloensis and grandiflora [...] "may be made to breed together indiscriminately," [...] and he found, in accordance with the principle of analogous variation, [...] "that similar varieties could be obtained from the seeds of any one of them." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of map-based investigations into plant genome architecture has featured {{the use of}} Ouantitative Trait loci (OTl) analysis to investigate gene function, the genetics of species divergence and for breeding purposes. To date, however, there has been comparatively little progress on the genetics underlying adaptive intra-specific variation. The present study investigates the genetic basis of phenotypic divergence between plants of wild populations of the <b>alpine</b> <b>strawberry,</b> Fragaria vesca, growing in geographically dispersed parts of the United Kingdom. A series of populations centred around Rogart, the Northern Highlands, Scotland occupy habitats seasonally dominated by bracken (Pteridium aquiiinum) and are characterised by a compact, dwarf habit. Another set of five populations in the extreme south-west of England (Padstow, Cornwall) were found in oak- beech woodland margins and are typified by a more bushy, erect habit. Morphometric analysis in a common garden experiment and genetic distance analysis established that this phenotypic variation has an underlying genetic basis. This was then tnvestlqated further using a map-based approach. An F 2 progeny was created between phenotypically and genetically divergent paranetal clones from Cornwall (male parent) and the Northern Highlands (female parent). The F 1 offspring were selfed to generate a mapping F 2 population. Male and female linkage maps were created from this population using both AFlP and SSR markers. Both maps span seven linkage groups, corresponding to the base chromosome number of the genus Fragaria. The maps cover a genetic distance of 294. 1 cM and 351 cM respectively. O'Tl, analysis was performed {{and a total of}} ten OTls were identified for six morphological traits. All traits for which a OTl was detected are leaf traits. A cluster of OTls was detected on linkage group VI of the female map, indicating that either single genes found in that genomic region have pleiotropic effects or that several linked genes contribute to each trait. The identification of a putative Scottish ecotype of Fragaria vesca has therefore established that OTl analysis is a valid tool for the study of adaptive changes at the intra-specific level.

The fruits obtained in spring, in comparison with the autumn ones, showed higher values of dry and optical residues, reducing sugars (glucose and fructose) and sucrose, acids (citric, malic, succinic and ascorbic), calcium, potassium, iron and chloride; in autumn, instead, magnesium, copper, nitrates, phosphates and sulphates were more concentrated in the edible organs. The higher crop layer caused a greater accumulation of all the analysed substances, except for the nitrates which did not vary. 	With regard to the nutritive solution EC, the 2. 2 mS•cm- 1 treatment resulted in the highest levels of all the organic constituents; within the mineral compounds, only Fe, Cu, Zn and Cl showed a different trend, as the maximum concentrations corresponded to 1. 9 mS•cm- 1 EC. The control fruits attained, in autumn, the lowest values for most of the organic components and of the mineral anions, in comparison with those in hydroponics; only the inorganic cations were generally more concentrated with the traditional technique. In spring, the organic constituents and the mineral anions were again found in higher quantities in the fruits obtained by saline solutions, but only with regard to the higher crop level; by contrast, an intermediate accumulation of the latter substances was recorded in the control, referring to the four EC treatments within the lower layer which also often showed lower values of the inorganic cations...|$|E
