5|$|Bees may be solitary or {{may live}} in {{various types of}} communities. Sociality, of several {{different}} types, appears to have evolved independently many times within the bees. The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.|$|E
5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E

5|$|Since the 20thcentury it {{has been}} {{traditional}} for the newly crowned monarch {{and other members of}} the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear on the balcony, from where in 1953 they watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one, the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks display is held nearby, usually in Hyde Park. In 1902, EdwardVII's illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in the ballroom there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} factors are that the recipient not have produced isohemagglutinins, {{and that they have}} low levels of Tcell-independent antigens.

Studies have shown that the period under which a recipient may undergo ABOi transplantation may be prolonged by exposure to nonself A and B antigens. Furthermore, should the recipient (for example, type B-positive with a type AB-positive graft) require eventual retransplantation, the recipient may receive a new organ of either blood type.|$|E

The girls think Shana was 'A', and with her gone, they no longer worry about 'A'. However, 'A' returns, blowing up the Cavanaugh house and leaving the liars more afraid than ever. With Alison back, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer notice how their friendship has changed since Ali's disappearance. The other residents in Rosewood also deal with Alison coming home, and it leads to Mona making an army against her, consisting of residents whom Ali bullied back in the day.

25|$|Arginine is a conditionally {{essential}} amino acid in humans and rodents, {{as it may be}} required depending on the health status or life cycle of the individual. For example, while healthy adults can supply their own requirement for arginine, immature and rapidly growing individuals require arginine in their diet, and it is also essential under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury and sepsis, or when the small intestine and kidneys, which are the major sites of arginine biosynthesis have been damaged. It is, however, an {{essential amino acid}} for birds, as {{they do not have a}} urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which needs to be processed through the urea cycle, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not enough arginine present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing {{think of it as a}} 0), <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit then do not write this carry-digit as a superscript, but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E

Gibson's social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell.|$|E

500|$|Horses {{can become}} anxious or {{stressed}} {{if there are}} {{long periods of time}} between meals. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine. [...] When horses are in a herd, their behavior is hierarchical; the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first. [...] Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all. [...] Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately, or spread [...] feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat. [...] In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly. [...] Horses may also eat in undesirable ways, such as bolting their feed, or eating too fast. [...] This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances.|$|E
