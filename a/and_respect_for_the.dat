5|$|The Bonville-Courtenay feud {{is often}} given {{as an example}} of the degree to which law and order <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often {{considered}} it a cause of the later Wars of the Roses; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at Clyst (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near Exeter, which resulted in loss of life.|$|E
5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E

25|$|This {{thread of}} local feeling <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> laws {{runs through the}} early {{operations}} of both sides, almost irrespective of the main principles at stake. Many promising schemes failed because of the reluctance of militiamen to serve outside their own county. As the offensive lay with the King, his cause naturally suffered from this far more than that of Parliament.|$|E

25|$|Paganism's public rituals are {{generally}} calendrical, although the pre-Christian festivals that Pagans {{use as a}} basis varied across Europe. Nevertheless, common to almost all Pagan religions is an emphasis on an agricultural cycle <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dead. Common Pagan festivals include those marking the summer solstice and winter solstice {{as well as the}} start of spring and the harvest. In Wicca, a Wheel of the Year has been developed which typically involves eight seasonal festivals.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, right-wing {{populism}} {{often takes}} the form of distrust of the European Union and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values. In the United States, the Tea Party movement states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the Constitution, small federal government <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending and balancing the budget.|$|E
25|$|After the {{disastrous}} 1936 coal mine tragedy at Moose River, the provincial premier requested Edwards' assistance in coordinating the rescue mission. Edwards transmitted messages and coordinated No. 5 Squadron aircraft to fly rescue equipment and personnel to the mine and {{to transport the}} injured to hospitals in Halifax; enabling them to receive treatment several days earlier than if transported by land. Millions in North America and Europe heard the rescue described on the radio. It was during these broadcasts that Edwards became known as he explained the RCAF's role in the rescue; his leadership engendered interest in air power <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RCAF.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Farr {{learned that}} Ramanathan had {{established}} his Uduvil Ramanathan Girls College, {{and at the}} age of fifty-two, she sold all her possessions and moved to Ceylon, returning to her first vocation, that of a teacher. Farr was appointed Lady Principal by Ramanathan and the administration of the school was turned over to her. Certainly the organizational skills she learned as the Praemonstratrix of the Golden Dawn served Farr in her new position, and due to her tolerance <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tamil traditions, the school thrived under her administration. Farr also kept up her correspondences with Yeats, and sent him her translations of Tamil poetry.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, six core states {{founded the}} EU's predecessor, the European Economic Community (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany). The {{remaining}} states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. On 1 July 2013, Croatia became the newest member {{state of the}} EU. In order to accede, a state must fulfill {{the economic and political}} requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic, free market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire.|$|E

Accordingly, the Core emphasizes the development of whole human persons who are educated in the humanizing arts and sciences; skilled in expression and in scholarly investigation; and aware of the interrelationship of all knowledge and the interdependence of all peoples. Moreover, it promotes the integration of faith and reason by imparting a deeper knowledge of <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> students' own cultural and religious traditions {{as well as those}} of others. Finally, it highlights the development of intellect, character, and leadership, and the responsible social actions which flow from them.|$|E

500|$|In a 1964 interview, Lee {{remarked that}} her {{aspiration}} was [...] "to be... the Jane Austen of South Alabama." [...] Both Austen and Lee challenged the social {{status quo and}} valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, {{and later in the}} book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, [...] "in Austenian fashion", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: [...] "affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> individual without regard for status".|$|E

By {{the time of his}} death, Francisco de Lima, a senator in his own right, had long since lost his former influence and had not held any office of importance for years. Nevertheless, Caxias and Francisco de Lima maintained a loving and respectful relationship to the very end, as may be seen in the few surviving letters between them. His relationship with other family members, however, was marred by resentment, as he told his wife years later: [...] "We are placed in the foreground of our society, causing even envy to your relatives and to mine as well." ...|$|E
