5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, {{it was meant to}} be realistic and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder <b>and</b> <b>familiarity</b> for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, as opposed to the single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E

40|$|A new {{direction}} in social perception research is developed. The present research explored {{the impact of}} <b>familiarity</b> <b>and</b> time on social perception processes based on cognitive neuroscience models, social categorization models, and memory consolidation constructs. Familiarity was manipulated within an exposure task and time was manipulated by testing participants both 2 - 6 hr and 48 hr after the exposure task. Experiment 1 investigated the influence of <b>familiarity</b> <b>and</b> time on the argument of the automaticity of social categorization and associated stereotypes by testing the argument with two separate tasks. Experiment 1 a tested the influence of <b>familiarity</b> <b>and</b> time on associated stereotypes and found that, with <b>familiarity</b> <b>and</b> time, participants responded to individualizing information faster than to stereotypic information. Experiment 1 b tested the influence of <b>familiarity</b> <b>and</b> time on social categorization and found further support for the automaticity of social categorization. Experiment 2 further investigated the influence of <b>familiarity</b> <b>and</b> time on social perception by embedding cognitive loads within a categorization task. Experiment 2 found little support for the influence of <b>familiarity</b> <b>and</b> time on social categorization and cognitive loads. The current research is discussed for its relevance to models of social perception. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the value of}} both task- and team-focused processes in dealing with temporal diversity in teams. Particularly, we focus on team diversity in pacing styles (i. e., team members’ differences in how to distribute efforts over the available time in working toward deadlines). In a cross-sectional survey study of 38 consultancy teams, we examined the joint moderating effects of action planning <b>and</b> temporal <b>familiarity</b> {{on the relationship between}} pacing style diversity and team collaboration. Pacing style diversity tended to be negatively associated with team collaboration under most levels of action planning <b>and</b> temporal <b>familiarity.</b> Pacing style diversity and team collaboration related positively only when both action planning <b>and</b> temporal <b>familiarity</b> were high. This moderating effect was mediated by temporal consensus (i. e., team members’ shared understanding of the temporal aspects of executing collective tasks). Thus, the co-occurrence of action planning <b>and</b> temporal <b>familiarity</b> is particularly important for temporally heterogeneous teams to collaborate effectively by facilitating a shared perspective on the team’s temporal approach to the task...|$|R

25|$|The {{dimension}} of physical quantities {{of interest in}} mechanics can be {{expressed in terms of}} base dimensions M, L, and T – these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is the one most commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (as some have done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a change of basis. The choice of the base set of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility <b>and</b> <b>familiarity.</b> The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must span the space, and be linearly independent.|$|E

25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} the Gacaca activities and the gradual support for Gacaca by the authorities was clearly motivated {{by the fact that}} the ordinary justice system was virtually non-existent after the genocide. The Gacaca had to do what it did before—relieve the pressure on the ordinary courts. These were now not working slowly, as they did before, but not working at all. Once they started to work, they were quickly overloaded with the cases of genocide suspects who were filling the prisons. This new form of justice was bold, but not unprecedented: This becomes evident when one considers the emerging numbers of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRC) as, for example, that in South Africa. The slogan of the South African TRC “Revealing is Healing” and its argument that truth-telling serves as a “therapeutic function” underline this assumption. The TRC format was suggested to the Rwandan government, but ultimately they chose to pursue mass justice through Gacaca; a system where their country had roots <b>and</b> <b>familiarity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because Music has {{the ability}} to access {{multiple}} parts of the brain, music therapy is highly effective in providing therapeutic support for individuals with all types of dementia. Research indicates that the sections of the brain weakened by dementia can be supported and in some cases strengthened by other areas of the brain through musical activities. Musical ability and awareness {{is also one of the}} last functions to be compromised in an individual with dementia, which makes it an especially effective intervention, even in people with very late stage forms of the disease. Music therapy is more than simply listening to or playing music. Through the use of evidence based interventions and clinical assessments, a music therapist works to improve the lives and abilities of individuals. These interventions can decrease anxiety, improve speech and self- expression, and a decrease in negative behaviors and isolation which are commonly found in individuals with dementia. Common negative behaviors that correspond with dementia are depression and agitation. According to Mary S. Mittelman, the director of psychosocial research at Langone Medical Center, music therapy helped to decrease both of these negative substantially. The reason for this is because in the brain, the parts corresponding to music are preserved even through the effects of dementia. Due to these being preserved, residents who live their lives in a blur find some clarity <b>and</b> <b>familiarity</b> through music, creating lower levels of stress and agitation.|$|E
