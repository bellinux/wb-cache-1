At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team {{defeated}} Edge and Orton's {{team in a}} clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match. In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|On the planet, Gralik {{explains}} that Degra {{told him that}} the kemocite was for research, and explains how the Avian race were assumed to be made extinct in the Xindi Civil War. A Reptilian shuttle arrives early, carrying Degra, to collect the final shipment of kemocite. Gralik takes the away team to a cave that will protect them from scans, but they are soon attacked by robotic drones sent by the Reptilians. When Gralik returns home, he is confronted by Degra, who reveals the true purpose of the kemocite, to build <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> destroy a ruthless alien species. T'Pol in the meantime has modified the canister of kemocite so that the ship can track it. Archer manages to sneak it aboard the shuttle and after the Reptilians leave, Archer thanks Gralik for his trust and help.|$|E

Instead {{of a traditional}} health system, the game features a system similar to the Halo series of video games. The player character has both a regenerating shield and health, the latter {{of which can be}} replenished by a health pack. The weapon selection in Fall of Cybertron is expanded, with new weapons that can take on very significant upgrades, including one that allows <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> fire up to 75% faster. These are purchased through Teletran 1 kiosks found throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|The Overmind is {{the center}} of the Zerg Swarm's hive mind society, created by the Xel'Naga as a single {{consciousness}} for their experiments on the Zerg. It is the antagonist of StarCraft, where it is voiced by Jack Ritschel; Paul Eiding voices the character in Wings of Liberty. At some point during its creation, it was secretly enslaved by the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, who implanted it with a directive to destroy the Protoss and bound the Zerg to a hive mind. The Overmind becomes aware of Xel'Naga, attacking and assimilating its masters. Through this, the Overmind learns of the existence of the Protoss and is determined to assimilate the fellow Xel'Naga-empowered species, believing this will result in perfection. To provide the necessary force to overcome the Protoss, the Overmind targets the psionic potential of the Terrans for assimilation. He also assimilated Sarah Kerrigan so as to create <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> free the Zerg from the control of his Dark Master. The Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds, eventually leading to Zeratul assassinating the cerebrate Zasz. Zasz's death momentarily links the minds of the Overmind and Zeratul, allowing Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet's surface. Following a lengthy and costly campaign on Aiur, Tassadar harnesses the energies of the dark templar to strike at the Overmind directly, disintegrating it.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who {{was standing in the}} doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second door slam the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E

25|$|During the war, Britain {{had been}} a major sponsor of Arab {{nationalist}} thought and ideology, primarily as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> use against {{the power of the}} Ottoman Empire. Although the Arab forces were promised a state that included much of the Arabian Peninsula and the Fertile Crescent the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between Britain and France provided for the territorial division of much of that region between the two imperial powers. During the inter-war years and the British Mandate period, when Arab lands were under French and British control, Arab nationalism became an important anti-imperial opposition movement against European rule.|$|E

25|$|Another {{benefit of}} boosting, in {{addition}} to making weapons smaller, lighter, and with less fissile material for a given yield, is that it renders weapons immune to radiation interference (RI). It was discovered in the mid-1950s that plutonium pits would be particularly susceptible to partial predetonation if exposed to the intense radiation of a nearby nuclear explosion (electronics might also be damaged, {{but this was a}} separate problem). RI was a particular problem before effective early warning radar systems because a first strike attack might make retaliatory weapons useless. Boosting reduces the amount of plutonium needed in <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> below the quantity which would be vulnerable to this effect.|$|E
