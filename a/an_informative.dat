He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The Intertidal Zone, <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> comic book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (19931996) after his success with short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), which he made while studying animation.|$|E

25|$|The novelist Dinah Craik visited Tintagel in 1883 and {{published}} <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> {{account of her}} journey through Cornwall the following year. William Howitt's visit was quite different: his account is called 'A day-dream at Tintagel' (in 'Visits to Remarkable Places'). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include Anthony Trollope's short story Malachi's Cove and the Williamsons' epistolary novel Set in Silver, 1909 (by Charles and Alice Williamson). Ernest George Henham was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym, John Trevena, for many of his books. It is probable that the surname he chose {{was derived from the}} original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{organization}} Aides Haute-Garonne organized La nuit de la Sainte-Capote (the {{night of the}} Holy Condom), <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> evening about the prevention of the human immunodeficiency virus. To announce the event, {{the organization}} handed out a prospectus. The prospectus contained a head-and-shoulders image of a woman wearing a nun's bonnet. Near that image was the image of two pink condoms. The prospectus's text asked {{for the protection of}} Sainte Capote. A Catholic organization initiated proceedings on the ground that the prospectus insulted a group because of its religion. The court of first instance convicted Aides Haute-Garonne. The first court of appeal, the Court of Toulouse, upheld the conviction. In February 2006, the Supreme Court of Appeal annulled the conviction.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{initially}} formed, Unomásunos reporters were not experienced in investigative journalism as other newspapers in Mexico City. However, as its reporters began {{to specialize in}} certain investigative topics, Unomásuno brought forward elements of readership diversity and professionalism that were not present in the Mexican press of the time. Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, Unomásuno built a reputation among Mexican readers for having <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> and fact-based character. Opinion-based sections, like editorial pages, were reduced while private advertisements grew. Unomásuno was categorized for having a center-left or left-wing orientation. Unomásuno {{was one of the}} leading independent leftist newspapers in Mexico. The newspaper tended to give a closer view of Mexico's daily life. It discussed the issues in rural sector and in unions, topics that were discussed with less frequency in other media outlets. Unomásuno also published articles about feminism, machismo, LBGT movements, and the rights of domestic workers. It did not shy away from using profanity and denouncing the government.|$|E

25|$|In August 1899 when {{it became}} clear that the Labour Party could be manoeuvred into {{bringing}} down the Reid Government, Barton resigned as leader of the opposition, as he was unacceptable to Labour, and William Lyne took his place. He refused an offer to become Attorney-General again. He resigned from Parliament in February 1900 so that he could travel to London with Alfred Deakin and Charles Kingston to explain the federation bill to the British Government. Around the same time on 15 January 1900 Barton published a 28-page United Australia magazine to disseminate <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> narrative for the propositions of a future Federal Government that he hoped to lead. The British Government was adamant in its opposition to the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council as incorporated in the draft constitution; eventually, Barton agreed that constitutional (inter se) matters would be finalised in the High Court, but other matters could be appealed to the Privy Council.|$|E
25|$|At the {{invitation}} of the Council and {{the management of the}} railway a supporters association, 'The Volk's Electric Railway Association' was formed in 1995. Members of the Association provide practical and promotional help to the railway, including operation and maintenance tasks. The Association also attends various exhibitions with a large operating model of the railway {{as it was in the}} 1950s. Membership is open to all with an interest in the railway. Members receive <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> quarterly magazine, reduced rate travel on the railway and free admission to a series of interesting winter meetings held in Brighton. The Association also acts as a collector for Volk's memorabilia and ephemera, some of which can be seen at the South Downs Heritage Centre in Hassocks. The largest object now in the care of the Association is the ex Southend Car which between 1950 and 2000 carried the Volk's fleet number 9. Car 3 will become a two-year joint restoration project if the temporary restoration shed gains consent during spring 2014.|$|E
25|$|In 1266 the Mamluk Sultan Baybars {{converted}} the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron into an exclusive Islamic sanctuary and banned Christians and Jews from entering, which previously {{would be able}} to enter it for a fee. The ban remained in place until Israel took control of the building in 1967. In 1286, leader of German Jewry Meir of Rothenburg, was imprisoned by Rudolf I for attempting to lead a large group of Jews hoping to settle in Palestine. Exiled from France in 1306, Ishtori Haparchi (d. 1355) arrived in Palestine and settled Bet She'an in 1313. Over the next seven years he compiled <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> geographical account of the land in which he attempts to identify biblical and talmudic era locations. Two other noted Spanish kabbalists, Hananel ibn Askara and Shem Tov ibn Gaon, emigrated to Safed around this time. During the tolerant reign of Nassir Mahomet (1299–1341) Jewish pilgrims from Egypt and Syria were able to spend the festivals in Jerusalem, which had a large Jewish community. Many of the Jerusalem Jews occupied themselves with study of the codes and the kabbalah. Others were artisans, merchants, calligraphers or physicians. The vibrant community of Hebron engaged in weaving, dyeing and glassware manufacturing; others where shepherds.|$|E

[...] She not only considers the book a [...] "how-to" [...] in how to create and produce a children's television show, but also an important exposure to the public the hard work and dedication it required {{to put it on the}} air. [...] For Tierney, the most interesting part of the story Lesser tells in the book is how people with strong and different opinions and temperaments learned to work together and to give television [...] "a little bit of class". [...] She applauds Lesser for including the CTW's detractors, but believes that he unnecessarily included the more ridiculous criticisms in order to give Sesame Street and the Workshop more credibility. [...] Rose K. Goldsen of Cornell University criticizes Lesser for legitimizing [...] "the strange folk belief that depositing lore in a child's head is the same as educating a child". [...] She criticizes the research Lesser describes in the book, and insists that it should be considered as product-testing rather than educational research. [...] She also criticizes Lesser for legitimizing consumerism.|$|E

500|$|Vancouver {{made the}} trade {{not with the}} {{intention}} of keeping Vanbiesbrouck, but rather in an attempt to keep other players on their roster from being drafted. Rules of the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft allowed teams to protect one goaltender, nine forwards and five defensemen. Additional rules stated that teams could only lose one goaltender in the draft and prevented teams from losing both a defenseman and a goaltender. Prior to the draft Florida Panthers general manager Bobby Clarke won a coin-toss giving them the first pick in the draft. Thus with their first selection, the Panthers picked Vanbiesbrouck to be the number one goalie for their team. Upon his arrival in Florida, Vanbiesbrouck went on a [...] "mall tour" [...] to help elevate the visibility of the franchise and made <b>an</b> <b>informative</b> video explaining ice hockey terms for Blockbuster, then owners of the franchise. In January 1994 he made his return to Madison Square Garden. In his first game back to his former home venue, Vanbiesbrouck made 51 saves ultimately losing the game 3–2 to his former team. During the season, he was also named to the All-Star game as the Panthers' sole representative. In the game Vanbiesbrouck played the third period, made six saves and was credited with the win. At the completion of his first season in Florida, he played in 57 games posting a 21–25–11 record, registering a 2.53 GAA, and his career best save percentage of [...]924 ranked him second in the league. Vanbiesbrouck was named a Second Team NHL All-Star and was shortlisted for the Hart and Vezina Trophies. His 21 wins tied the Minnesota North Stars' Cesare Maniago's record for the most by an expansion goaltender. The record was later passed by Ron Tugnutt during the Columbus Blue Jackets inaugural season. The Panthers finished the season with 83 points, one point behind the New York Islanders, for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The following season was shortened due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout. As a result, Vanbiesbrouck played in just 37 games registering a 14–15–4 record. He lowered his GAA from the previous year to 2.47 and increased his shutout total from one to four. However his save percentage dropped to [...]914. The Panthers again fell a point short of making the playoffs.|$|E

By choosing the prior from the gamma family with at least 1 degree of freedom, we ensure that the prior density is zero at the boundary and thus the marginal posterior mode of the group-level variance will be positive.
