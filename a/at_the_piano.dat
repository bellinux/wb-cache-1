5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 2017 Yoshiki's {{management}} {{announced that}} the drummer would undergo urgent surgery on May 16, where an artificial disc would be inserted between his vertebrae. Due to his health conditions, {{it was reported that}} concerts would need to be either rescheduled or cancelled. On June 9, X Japan announced at a press conference that the concerts would not be postponed but instead performed in an acoustic set, with Yoshiki <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> as it is uncertain whether {{he would be able to}} play the drums in the future.|$|E
5|$|The Molly Brant One Woman Opera, {{composed}} by Augusta Cecconi-Bates, was first performed at St. George's Cathedral in Kingston on April 25, 2003, {{under the aegis}} of the Cataraqui Archaeological Research Foundation. The 2003 production was sung by Kingston soprano Rhona Gale, with Carrie Wyatt, flute, and the composer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> The opera has since been developed into a full four acts.|$|E

5|$|The various musical themes {{associated}} with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire Ring cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies and phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments {{to the source of}} the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> on the night before he died in Venice, in 1883.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{performing}} {{new works}} dedicated to him, Szigeti also championed {{the music of}} other contemporary composers, notably Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. He {{was among the first}} violinists to make Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto a standard part of his repertoire, and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky (including the Duo Concertante, recorded with the composer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> in 1945.) The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice, under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos. Most famously, Szigeti recorded the Bloch concerto, a premier recording made in 1939 with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Charles Munch (originally released on Columbia LP and reissued on Membran CD).|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

5|$|Stravinsky {{composed}} Threni {{between the}} summer of 1957 and the spring of 1958, beginning it on 29 August 1957 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> of the nightclub in the hotel where he was staying in Venice, and completing it before 27 March of the next year. It was first performed on 23 September 1958 {{in the hall of}} the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, Venice. The composer conducted soloists Ursula Zollenkopf, Jeanne Deroubaix, Hugues Cuénod, Richard Robinson, Charles Scharbach and Robert Oliver, the NDR Chor and the NDR Sinfonieorchester. Stravinsky dedicated the performance to Alessandro Piovesan, director of the Venice Biennale, who had recently died.|$|E
5|$|From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French Army in {{the last}} months of the First World War and the {{immediate}} post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the Franco-German front, after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a typist at the Ministry of Aviation. His duties allowed him time for composition; the Trois mouvements perpétuels for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> of the local elementary school at Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pré, and he completed his first song cycle, Le bestiaire, setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did not create a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer's name known in France, and the Trois mouvements perpétuels rapidly became an international success. The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing for whatever instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.|$|E
5|$|The Delius {{household}} was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, {{and played}} for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz {{was drawn to the}} music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to London for Delius to attend concerts and opera.|$|E
