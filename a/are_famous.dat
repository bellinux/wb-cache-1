5|$|Northern mockingbirds <b>are</b> <b>famous</b> {{for their}} song repertoires. Studies {{have shown that}} males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females.

The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range.
