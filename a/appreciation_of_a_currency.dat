40|$|The {{evolution}} of the euro since its inception has appeared inexplicable. This paper develops a monetary model of the euro/US dollar exchange rate to track {{the progress of the}} currency, both before and after Stage 3 EMU. The relationship between the exchange rate, money stocks, GDP, interest and inflation rates, and prices is identified. The observed patterns of behaviour during the 1990 s are used to predict the euro’s value up to mid- 2000; a consistent finding is that the euro is over-predicted by 23 – 30 %. This finding is robust to the use of alternative sample periods and alternative estimation methodologies, as long as each of the variables is treated as endogenous. This monetary model does not give much weight to factors such as productivity. However, the past {{evolution of}} European exchange rates suggests that productivity trends are indeed important. Some estimates suggest that an annual one percentage point in the intercountry differential in tradablenontradable productivity causes a 0. 85 – 1. 7 % real <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>currency.</b> *This article is based upon revised results from ‘The Empirical Determinants of the Euro’, a paper presented at the Deutsche Bundesbank conference Equilibrium Exchange Rates of the euro (27 – 8 March 2000), organized by Bernd Schnatz.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to utilize the Gravity Model of Trade {{in order to get}} an {{understanding}} of the reasons behind Russian export flows. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out if the most common gravity variables have a similar effect on Russian exports as they do for most of the advanced economies. As Russian exports consist mainly of raw materials, one could assume that they behave differently from the exports of western countries. During the past two decades the Russian economy has gone through huge changes. The collapse of Soviet Union forced the country from a planned economy to a more western market economy in which the government still plays a major role. As a result of this, the trade flows from Russia have multiplied as the country has integrated to the Global markets. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The data includes Russia's exports to its 31 most important trading partners from 1996 to 2010. The gravity variables such as country's GDP and population were retrieved from OECD statistics database, national databases and Central Bank of Russia database. Distances between trading countries were self-calculated. The study was performed using the panel data method and by running separate regressions for Russian total exports, Russian oil and gas exports and Russian non-oil and gas exports. RESULTS: While Russian population has on average been declining during the period studied, the exports have grown substantially, which causes the coefficient for population to be negative. At the same time the ruble has on average been appreciating and therefore the real exchange rate variable has a positive coefficient. This result differs from the majority of western countries, where real <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> usually leads to declining exports. Distance between Russia and importing country has a negative coefficient as expected, but it's not statistically significant...|$|E

Motivated by theoretical and empirical results in the literature, the paper proposes new econometric models that can characterize nonlinear and asymmetric dynamics between import prices and exchange rate changes in a parsimonious fashion. Findings show the presence of complete and incomplete pass-through regimes depending upon the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>appreciations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> and inflation rates both in the short-run and in the long-run. Results also reveal threshold effects and asymmetry in the pass-through relationship over appreciations/depreciations as well as inflationary and disinflationary periods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-country model with coexisting exporters and multinational firms that engage in Cournot competition.

This impact depends on the following trade-off: On the one hand, <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>currency</b> raises the value of local affiliate sales there (a revenue effect). On the other hand, it reduces costs of foreign market penetration through exports, thereby fosters competition and renders ultinational activities in this country less attractive (a competition effect).

40|$|In this paper, we {{will analyze}} {{the effect of}} the reform of {{exchange}} rate institution on the real estate market based on <b>a</b> case study <b>of</b> Taiwan and Japan', and the result suggests that the <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country's <b>currency</b> leads to the rise of real estate price, or even worse, the economic bubble. Quantified analysis of the international capital flows and the real estate price volatility in China real estate market shows that the expectation <b>of</b> the <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> RMB is one of the elements that inspire foreign investment speculating in China real estate market. So we suggest that the government should use various methods of macroeconomic control, based on which to make out the <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> RMB step by step, {{to crack down on the}} speculations and to make the yield to the normal level, in order that the international speculative capital cannot gain speculative profits and stop their speculation. Since 2006, the yuan to the US dollar exchange rate has launched fierce "seesaw battle " in 8 : 1 crossings. On June 30, the central parity of the RMB against the US dollar is 7. 9956.

30|$|For oil-exporting countries, the oil-specific demand shocks have a {{negative}} and statistically significant impact on exchange rates in Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom at the 0.01 quantile, and in Mexico at the 0.1 quantile. This is consistent with prior expectations and empirical evidence that rising oil prices cause <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oil-exporting country’s <b>currency</b> (US dollar depreciation). For oil-importing countries, oil-specific demand shocks have negative and significant impact on exchange rate returns in Australia and the EU while they have a positive and significant impact in Japan. Depending on the share of commodity imports in a country’s total imports, central banks have incentives to actively ensure the external sustainability of oil-importing countries by reducing foreign exchange reserves. This effect may mitigate the systematic effect of exchange rates in oil-importing countries in response to oil-specific demand shocks.|$|R

Our model finds (1) when speculators face no liquidity shocks, the central bank tends to appreciate the currency quickly to discourage speculative capital; (2) when speculators face liquidity shocks, the central bank optimally pre-commits to a slower appreciation path, and the appreciation takes the longest time when the probability of liquidity shocks takes intermediate values; (3) the central bank tends to appreciate the currency more quickly when it conducts discretionary policy. ...|$|R
40|$|China’s {{currency}} {{policy has}} been one of the most hotly debated subjects in the United States (U. S.) over the past decade. U. S. citizens commonly believe that the peg of the renminbi (RMB) to the U. S. dollar (USD) causes Chinese employment and exports to boom at the expense of the U. S. export industry and its workers.

A central bank decides the optimal appreciation path based on three factors: (i) Misalignment costs associated with the gap between the actual exchange rate and the fundamental exchange rate, (ii) short-term adjustment costs due to fast appreciation, and (iii) capital losses due to speculative capital inflows. We examine two cases in which speculators do and do not face liquidity shocks. We show that, in the case without liquidity shocks, the central bank should appreciate quickly to discourage speculative capital, and should appreciate more quickly in initial periods than in later periods. In the case with liquidity shocks, the central bank should pre-commit to a slow appreciation path to discourage speculative capital. The central bank should appreciate slowest when the probability of liquidity shocks takes middle values. If the central bank cannot commit and can only take a discretionary policy, appreciation should be faster. exchange rate, appreciation, capital flows...|$|R
40|$|Economic and {{monetary}} union has a particularly far-reaching impact on farmers and agricultural policy in general. The farming sector has traditionally played a {{lead role in}} integration. Nevertheless, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) soon reached its limits in the current European monetary system. Common farm prices, subsidies, etc. are almost impossible to implement without <b>a</b> common <b>currency.</b> The CAP has been regularly upset by currency turmoil and rocked by frequent crisis situations. The agricultural monetary regime developed as a make-shift solution is flawed and unable to forestall disadvantages for farmers in hard-currency countries. In the present system, the <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national <b>currency</b> translates into price and income pressures for farmers and (at least temporary) competitive disadvantages for their commercial standing. Benefits and disadvantages of EMU The single currency will provide the CAP with the stable foundation that it {{has so far been}} lacking. It eliminates the current practice of translating farm prices, subsidies, etc. from their fixed ECU rates to national currencies, which in turn means that the agricultural monetary regime will become superfluous. Exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate-caused distortions will no longer occur, so that EMU will, {{for the first time since}} the CAP was introduced, secure a common agricultural market that offers fair competitive terms to all participants. This is a crucial advantage and probably the greatest gain for farmers in the hard-currency countries such as Austria. The change to the euro nevertheless will entail both problems and costs for farmers. Position of Austrian farmers For Austrian farmers, the benefits of the single currency will prevail: their currently disadvantaged position in a hard-currency country will disappear and they will be able to compete at fair terms. The Austrian agricultural sector would prefer the first wave of EMU members to be large, to ensure that its benefits will be maximized. The participation of Italy in the single currency is especially important, as it is Austria's second largest market for farm products. A "small EMU" would not be desirable for the farming and food industry. The schilling-euro conversion rate will play a key role in the transition to EMU for the agricultural sector, as it affects the purchasing power of farm prices and producer subsidies fixed in euro, which in turn bears upon agricultural incomes. Should the schilling be appreciated vis-à-vis the currently valid "green rates", this would have a negative impact on farmers' incomes.
