40|$|In {{a series}} of indoor {{experiments}} spray drift potential was assessed when spraying over a spray drift testbench with two different driving speeds, 2 m/s and 4 m/s, two different spray boom heights, 30 cm and 50 cm, and two different nozzle spacing, 25 cm and 50 cm, for six different nozzle types. The nozzles types used were the standard flat fan XR as a reference nozzle and the DG, XLTD, IDN, AIXR and <b>AIRmix</b> as drift reducing nozzles types. A Patternator was used to check the cross distribution for the different nozzle types and settings. Spraying tests were carried out by adding the fluorescent dye Brilliant Sulfo Flavine to the spray agent. Potential spray drift deposition was measured placing collectors along the testbench quantifying the deposition of the spray plume behind the moving spray boom in windstill conditions. Results obtained from two laboratories set ups differ because of the variability of relative humidity in one laboratory. Spray drift reducing capability can be different at different settings depending on the nozzle type...|$|E

The unavoidable overspray, caused by poor transfer efficiency, has to be removed quickly from the paint booth, {{in order to preserve}} the painting quality on the subject surface. The therefore needed conditioned air stream results in intensive energy requirement for the disposal of the overspray. Against the background of increasing demands on energy-efficient painting processes, a research project has been launched focusing on increasing the efficiency of atomizers in painting processes. This paper summarizes some results of {{the current state of the}} research. The air supported high pressure atomizer, also known as AirCoat or <b>AirMix,</b> is basically an airless atomizer with additional air flow for improved atomization and homogenization of the spray cone. Compared to the well-known air spray painting, the spray transfer efficiency of airless and air-assisted atomizers is relatively high, corresponding to a lower overspray. Therefore, air-assist atomizing is used in the present experimental and numerical investigations. Fraunhofer diffraction and Laser-Doppler Anemometry were used to measure droplet size distributions and the integral droplet velocity in spray cone. Furthermore, the film thickness distribution on a flat plat was also measured. A commercial CFD code (ANSYS-FLUENT) was used in the numerical studies. lnfluences of the additional air flow in air-assist gun on the atomization process, the film thickness distribution and the transfer efficiency were studied. The experimental and simulation results delivered the necessary information for understanding the painting process using air-assisted guns and for improving the performance of the atomizer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs one of {{the most}} {{effective}} structures of flame stabilizer, cavity owns an important position in scramjet combustor research, especially the tandem dual-cavity, which has a remarkable advantage in promoting fuel <b>airmixing</b> and flame stability. In this paper,flow field characters of dual-cavity scramjet combustor were analyzed in details without and with combustion. The results show that, under the interaction of cavity flow and fuel injection, two sizes of vortexes were formed in the upstream cavity after combustion. The bigger vortex provides a stable flame and the smaller one protects the upstream cavity back wall from heat in a certain extent. Additionally, the unburned fuel was blew away to the downstream cavity for a further combustion as soon as it meets high-speed main stream, which is helpful to improve combustion efficiency and to make the scramjet combustor shorter. And the mass of kerosene drifted into cavities was determined by fuel-jet velocity, whichwould have an indirect effect on the combustion efficiency...|$|R
