25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E
2500|$|The first Stevens 520 {{appeared}} in Stevens' 1909 Catalog #52 {{and was also}} offered {{for sale in the}} Fall 1909 Sears & Roebuck catalog. It is easily recognizable by its [...] "Humpback" [...] double hump receiver. [...] It had a round slide release knob {{on the left side of}} the receiver, a visible breech locking bolt on the top of the receiver, and base models had a rounded pistol grip on the butt stock. The fore grip was ringed and uniform in size. The trigger housing was retained with three screws and the safety was a lever located inside the trigger guard in front of the trigger. The cartridge stop was a rocker design with <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> on front right side of the receiver. There were other models including a Model 522 trap gun and the 525, 530, and 535 with increasing levels of engraving and stock quality (some straight grip) and fore grips. Internally there was an inertial slide release block that was affixed to the inside of the receiver. [...] This inertial release used the recoil of a discharged round to unlock the breech. [...] The action was designed to only unlock after firing or with use of the slide release and not by dry firing like many modern shotguns. [...] All model 520s were only offered in 12 gauge until 1928.|$|E

40|$|To {{eliminate}} {{the requirement for}} skilled workers in Video cassette recorder (VCR) cylinder assembly lines, an automatic adjustment system for VCR magnetic heads on a rotating cylinder unit has been newly developed. The reconstructed image quality is strongly affected by magnetic head setting errors, such as; (I) Setting angle error for two symmetrically positioned head. (2) Rotational angle error for every individual head, in regard to <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> <b>screw</b> axis. (3) Error in the distances head tips protrude from a cylinder edge. The pertinent technical features for the system are high speed and highly accurate image processing algorithms, to deter-mine head positions using interferometric head images and very precise mechanisms and algorithms to adjust head positions, even when head slipping and elastic deformations occur. Adjustment speed for the system is 30 seclunit. One machine corresponds to three skilled operators in total productivity. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{circulation}} {{within the}} flow chamber was generated by an externally attached electric motor, which rotates up to 500 {{rounds per minute}} (rpm).

For the attachment of the custom-made biocompatible glass panel (diameter[*]=[*] 60  mm, thickness[*]=[*] 2  mm; 4 -mm central circular opening), the gear shafts’ lower end was disc shaped (diameter[*]=[*] 10  mm). The glass panel was fixed by an adjusting ring with <b>an</b> additional <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> from above.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used {{to secure}} an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|E
