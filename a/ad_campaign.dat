Other early issues included complaints by American players that experienced Japanese players had already completed all the quests. Square Enix responded by adding new servers in order to have game worlds with fewer expert players.|$|E
5|$|The Disney tag {{also was}} seen to have turned off people who assumed that the film was for children.
