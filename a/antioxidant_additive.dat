Our choice was made particularly on the olive oil as raw material because of its oleic acid content which is more to 75 %. The processes involved were epoxidation of oleic acid of the olive oil, opening of the oxirane ring, and esterification. The structures of the products were confirmed by FTIR. To test the effectiveness of our biobased <b>antioxidant</b> <b>additive,</b> we carried out Accelerated Oxidation Test – AOT on diesel without additive (blank) and diesel with additive with various concentrations: 2000, 4000 and 6000 ppm.

40|$|Here {{we report}} {{a new way}} to {{characterize}} the performance of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>additives</b> for dry charged negative plate of the lead acid battery by measuring the anodic excursion peaks (AEPs). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) combined with potential step method have been conducted to investigate the effects of polyhydric compounds (sorbitol) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) on AEPs and corrosion resistance. The results show that sorbitol increases AEPs but prevents the formation of PbO 2, and on the contrary CTAB promotes the formation of PbO 2 but eliminates AEPs. These phenomena reveal that the increase of AEPs and the increase of corrosion resistance of lead electrode are synchronous, which indicate that the additives that can enhance AEPs could be used as <b>antioxidant</b> <b>additives.</b> The effectiveness of the new AEPs test on searching <b>antioxidant</b> <b>additives</b> for protection of lead electrode has been compared with the general potentiodynamic polarization (Tafel) method, and the results of the two tests are consistent.

Materials and Methods: Semen collection using artificial vagina, twice weekly for 5 weeks from three pedigreed health breeding bulls of Mehsani breed, aged between 6 and 8 years. Immediately after initial evaluation all 30 qualifying ejaculates (10 /bull) were split into three aliquots and diluted at 34 °C keeping the concentration of 100 million spermatozoa/ml with standard TFYG extender as control and TFYG having two <b>antioxidant</b> <b>additives</b> - Cysteine HCl at 1 mg/ml and ascorbic acid at 0. 2 mg/ml to study their comparative performance. Semen filled in French Mini straws using IS- 4 system and gradually cooled to 4 °C and equilibrated for 4 h in cold handing cabinet.

40|$|Abstract: Effects of {{variation}} in biodiesel fuel properties on engine performance are not completely understood {{and there is a}} need for further research. A review of literature studies on biodiesel engine performance is presented here, summarising known effects and highlighting aspects in need of further study. In particular, it is evident few studies have reported on the effects of biodiesel oxidation, and <b>antioxidant</b> <b>additives.</b> It is well known that physical properties of biodiesel such as the bulk modulus and viscosity alter the injected fuel-spray characteristics. Biodiesel's greater density and oxygenated structure results in proportionally lower energy content. Unsaturation level affects Cetane number and combustion characteristics. Maximum engine power usually decreases according to the lower volumetric energy content of biodiesel, and fuel consumption is expected to increase around 14 %. Impacts on emissions are difficult to conclude generally due to contrasting reports. However, dominant emissions trends are usually an increase in oxides of nitrogen, and decreases in carbon monoxide, particulate matter, un-burned hydrocarbons and aromatics. Changes in emissions of carbonyl compounds are less certain. The effect of alcohol type used in biodiesel production is not clear, neither is the effect of biodiesel oxidation and <b>antioxidant</b> <b>additives...</b>|$|R
