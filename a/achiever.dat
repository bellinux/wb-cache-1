Although not a high <b>achiever</b> academically, he excelled at athletics {{and held the}} title of Victor Ludorum ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927. He also edited a school magazine, The Wyvern. His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether {{different groups of}} test-takers vary in their reported test-taking behaviour in a high-stakes test situation. A between-group design (N =  1129) {{was used to examine}} whether high and low <b>achievers,</b> as well as females and males, differ in their use of test-taking strategies, and in level of reported test anxiety and motivation. The results showed differences between high and low <b>achievers</b> on a number of test-taking strategies, where high <b>achievers</b> reported using successful strategies to a higher extent. There were also gender differences: females, for example, reported using random guessing to a higher extent than males. Further, low <b>achievers,</b> especially females, reported significantly higher levels of test anxiety than high <b>achievers,</b> and high <b>achievers</b> reported slightly higher levels of motivation when compared to low <b>achievers.</b> To conclude, test-taking behaviour might bring additional variance to test scores, {{whether or not this is}} irrelevant variance is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Academic content {{common to}} health science {{programs}} is often taught to a mixed group of students; however, content assessment may be consistent for each discipline. This study used a retrospective cluster analysis {{on such a}} group, first to identify high and low achieving students, and second, to determine the distribution of students within clusters based on their chosen program of study. Using a two-step cluster analysis based on five summative assessment scores for 773 undergraduate students, three distinct groups of students were identified: these are described as High <b>Achievers,</b> Standard <b>Achievers,</b> and Low <b>Achievers.</b> High <b>Achievers</b> scored higher in all five assessments compared with Standard <b>Achievers</b> and Low <b>Achievers</b> (all P < 0. 01). Also, Standard <b>Achievers</b> scored higher than Low <b>Achievers</b> in all assessments. Membership of the High <b>Achievers</b> cluster comprised 15 % Midwives, 20 % Nurses, 10 % Occupational Therapists, 11 % Paramedics, 24 % Physiotherapists, and 21 % Standard Pathway students. This novel approach {{provides an opportunity for}} quantitative reflection on assessment in a large group of students with diverse career aspirations.

40|$|AbstractAssessment is an {{important}} aspect of learning and teaching which enables students to progress to either higher grades of studies or seek for employment, it also helps the teachers to assess the effectiveness of their teaching methodology. Several academicians have emphasized that assessment has strong impact on all aspects of learning. According to Buck, Backwash is influence of examination on learning. We explored presence of backwash effect by questionnaire, rated on 6 point Likert scale with 10 items, in first year medical students and compared with their academic performances. The first year medical students were surveyed by newly developed and validated backwash questionnaire (BAQ) in this study. The questionnaire was based on qualitative studies on backwash effect. All students were categorised into three groups based on their previous exam scores. High <b>achievers</b> were defined as having cGPA of > 3. 5, medium <b>achievers</b> with cGPA ranges between 3. 5 to 3. 0 and low low <b>achievers</b> of cGPA < 3. 0. All three groups were evaluated for the presence of backwash. The first year MBBS students (n= 81) from a designated private medical university in Malaysia participated in this study. The male: female ratio was 1 : 1. High <b>achievers</b> were 39. 5 % (32 / 81), medium <b>achievers</b> 48. 1 % (39 / 81) and low <b>achievers</b> were 12. 3 % (10 / 81). Backwash was present in 46 % (38 / 81), highest in medium <b>achievers</b> 50 % (19 / 38), followed by high <b>achievers</b> 39 % (15 / 38), low <b>achievers</b> 10. 5 % (4 / 38). These results suggest that medium <b>achievers</b> are more prone to adopt learning strategies with the aim to pass assessments only. However, it is also interesting observation that high <b>achievers</b> also tend to have backwash. As far as low <b>achievers</b> are concerned, they have less backwash effect as observed in this study. The presence of negative effect of Backwash in high & medium <b>achievers,</b> suggests that assessment exert great impact on learning of medical students. To take the maximum benefits out of assessment, there is need to improve learning by adopting new strategies and improvements in teaching learning activities...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} I examine the question, {{what is the}} nature of prior {{mathematical}} knowledge that facilitates the construction of useful problem representations in the domain of geometry? The quality of prior knowledge is analysed in terms ofschemas that provide a measure of the degree of organisation of prior knowledge.

As expected, the high <b>achievers</b> produced more correct answers than the low <b>achievers.</b> More significantly, schema comparison indicated that the high <b>achievers</b> accessed more problem-relevant schemas than the low <b>achievers.</b> In a related task which focused on the problem diagram, both groups accessed almost equal numbers of geometry schemas. The results are interpreted as suggesting that high <b>achievers</b> build schemas that are qualitatively more sophisticated than low <b>achievers</b> which in turn helps them construct representations that are conducive to understanding the structure of geometry problems...|$|R
