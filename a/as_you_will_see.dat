At least I am sure that I had the twelve or more first lines from himself above three years after that period, and it was long before he finished it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Shelley {{from the}} Daily Mirror praised Jordan's writing and Brown's acting, saying [...] "tonight's episode of EastEnders is as {{powerful}} and poignant {{a piece of}} drama <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> on TV all year". Shelley opined that [...] "June [...] proves what the soaps can achieve when they use actors of genuine class and let them show what they are capable of" [...] and stated [...] "The fact that co-star John Bardon [...] is recovering from a stroke in real life adds an extra terrible pathos to the episode." [...] Cole Moreton of The Independent wrote [...] "The preview disc had revealed {{it to be a}} mesmerising piece of television, a kind of cor blimey Samuel Beckett, in which Brown conveyed her character's conflicting emotions beautifully." [...] Mark Wright of The Stage [...] praised Brown's acting as [...] "amazing", observing that she made the episode look [...] "effortless" [...] and commenting: [...] "I don't think there's another soap actress out there who could carry this." [...] Virgin Media selected the episode as showcasing one of the best ever soap opera performances, deeming Brown's portrayal [...] "comic and endearing" [...] and the episode [...] "never less than riveting." ...|$|E

But this book, whose title (Fleurs du mal) says everything, is clad, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even {{the knowledge of the}} French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron." ...|$|E

60|$|Those words touched Penrose in {{the right}} place. Now, as I {{understand}} his scruples, {{he felt that he}} might honorably speak out. His zeal more than balanced his weakness, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> presently <b>see.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad, sir, if {{there could be}} some reward given to Kreta and his men; <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have <b>seen</b> from my story, any credit that there is in the matter is {{certainly}} their due." ...|$|R

60|$|Second question: Considering that he {{is still}} a {{stranger}} to you, is there any harm in your asking me what sort of man my father is? No harm, my sweet one; but, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> presently <b>see,</b> I am afraid you have addressed yourself to the wrong person.|$|R
60|$|Every {{evening after}} Corny {{had put up}} his team and dined at a lunch-counter that made immediateness a specialty, he would clothe himself in evening raiment as correct <b>as</b> any <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in the palm rooms.

"No {{better than}} it should be, perhaps," [...] responded his {{dragoman}} facetiously; [...] "but {{no one can tell}} that from their words and manner, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> presently <b>see.</b> These are special ones," [...] he added, [...] "and pay income tax, so that their judgment in matters of morality is of considerable value." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{are seven}} parts of speech, and {{they agree with}} the five grand and {{universal}} divisions into which all things finite, by which I mean to exclude the idea of God, will be found to fall; that is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> often <b>see</b> it stated in my writings, especially in the Aids to Reflection[1]:-- ...|$|R

5000|$|Messemer is {{probably}} {{best known for his}} role as Oberst von Luger, the Kommandant in The Great Escape (1963).
