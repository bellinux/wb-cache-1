40|$|The {{luminescent}} protein aequorin {{from the}} jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> emits light by an intramolecular {{reaction in the}} presence of a trace amount of Ca 2 +. In order to understand the mechanism of the reaction, a study of structure-function relationships was undertaken with respect to modifying certain of its amino acid residues. This was done by carrying out oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis of apoaequorin cDNA and expressing the mutagenized cDNA in Escherichia coli. Amino acid substitutions were made at the three Ca 2 +-binding sites, the three cysteines, and a histidine in one of the hydrophobic regions. Subsequent assay of the modified aequorin showed that the Ca 2 +-binding sites, the cysteines, and probably the histidine all play a role in the bioluminescence reaction of aequorin...|$|E
40|$|Three {{environmental}} Mycobacterium strains (LB 501 T, LB 307 T and VM 552) able {{to degrade}} anthracene, phenanthrene or pyrene, respectively, were successfully electroporated with pAL 5000 -based plasmids containing the {{green fluorescent protein}} (gfp) gene of <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> {{under the control of}} the hsp 60 promoter of Mycobacterium bovis following a slightly modified standard procedure. Transformants showed irregular gfp expression profiles. Four plasmid derivatives were constructed that contained gene promoters isolated from, and adapted to, gene expression in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) -degrading mycobacteria. One derivative directed strong and homogeneous expression of GFP, allowing dual analysis of both GFP- and PAH-derived fluorescence as assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results reported here demonstrate the suitability of the pAL 5000 replicon for the development of recombinant DNA-based studies in PAH-degrading Mycobacterium spp...|$|E
40|$|The G-protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) superfamily {{represents one}} of the largest classes of molecules involved in signal transduction across the plasma membrane. Fluorescence-based approaches have provided valuable insights into GPCR functions such as receptor–receptor and receptor–ligand inter-actions, real-time assessment of signal transduction, receptor dynamics on the plasma membrane, and intracellular trafficking of receptors. This has largely been possible with the use of fluorescent probes such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> and its variants. We discuss the potential of fluorescence-based approaches in providing novel information on the membrane organization and dynamics of the G-protein-coupled serotonin 1 A receptor tagged to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). KEY WORDS: G-protein-coupled receptor; serotonin 1 A receptors; green fluorescent protein; enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; membrane domains; cell surface dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) {{from the}} jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> {{has been shown to}} dimerize at high concentrations, which could lead to artefacts in imaging experiments. To ensure a truly monomeric state, an A 206 K mutation has been introduced into most of its widely used variants, with minimal effect on the spectroscopic properties. Here, the first structure of one of these variants, the cyan fluorescent protein mTurquoise, is presented and compared with that of its dimeric version mTurquoise-K 206 A. No significant structural change is detected in the chromophore cavity, reinforcing the notion that this mutation is spectroscopically silent and validating that the structural analysis performed on dimeric mutants also applies to monomeric versions. Finally, it is explained why cyan versions of GFP containing the Y 66 W and N 146 I mutations do not require the A 206 K mutation to prevent dimerization at high concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The gene {{encoding}} the inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) of the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila is induced during intracellular infection, but is constitutively {{expressed in}} Eschericia coli. The causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, contains a well conserved copy of PPase. We {{sought to determine}} if expression of the M. tuberculosis PPase is regulated by the intracellular environment. Results A strain of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was constructed in which the <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> green fluorescent protein (GFP) {{is controlled by the}} promoter of the M. tuberculosis ppa gene. After prolonged exposure of the recombinant BCG strain within murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages, there was no observed increased activity of the ppa promoter. Furthermore, there was no change in promoter activity after exposure to various stress stimuli such as reduced pH, osmotic shock, nutrient limitation or oxidative stress. Conclusions These results suggest that macrophage induction of ppa is not a general phenomenon among intracellular pathogens. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a secreted form of <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> green fluorescent protein (secGFP) in a non-invasive live cell assay of membrane traffic in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that in comparison to GFP-HDEL, which accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secGFP generates a weak fluorescence signal when transported to the apoplast. The fluorescence of secGFP in the apoplast can be increased by growth of seedlings on culture medium buffered at pH 8. 1, suggesting that apoplastic pH is responsible, at least in part, for the low fluorescence intensity of seedlings expressing secGFP. Inhibition of secGFP transport between the ER and plasma membrane (PM), either by Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment or by genetic intervention results in increased intracellular secGFP accumulation accompanied by an increase in the secGFP fluorescence intensity. secGFP thus provides a valuable tool for forward and reverse genetic analysis of membrane traffic and endomembrane organisation in Arabidopsis. Using this assay for quantitative sublethal perturbation of secGFP transport, we identify a role for root hair defective 3 (RHD 3) in transport of secreted and Golgi markers between the ER and the Golgi apparatus...|$|E
40|$|Infection of the {{endometrium}} by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is {{a pivotal}} {{stage in the}} development of pelvic inflammatory disease in women. An ex vivo model of cultures of primary human endometrial cells was developed to study gonococcal-host cell interactions. To facilitate these studies, gonococci were transformed with a hybrid shuttle vector containing the gfp gene from <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria,</b> encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP), to produce intrinsically fluorescent bacteria. The model demonstrated that both pili and Opa proteins were important for both mediating gonococcal interactions with endometrial cells and inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Pil+ gonococci showed high levels of adherence and invasion, regardless of Opa expression, which was associated with increased secretion of IL- 8 chemokine and reduced secretion of IL- 6 cytokine. Gonococcal challenge also caused increased secretion of TNF-alpha cytokine, but this did not correlate with expression of pili or Opa, suggesting that release of components from non-adherent bacteria may be involved in TNF-alpha induction. Thus, the use of cultured primary endometrial cells, together with gonococci expressing green fluorescent protein, has the potential to extend significantly our knowledge, at the molecular level, of the role of this important human pathogen in the immunobiology of pelvic inflammatory disease...|$|E
40|$|The natural {{fluorescence}} of the <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> {{green fluorescent protein}} was exploited {{to isolate}} strong expression signals of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Gue! rin harbouring M. tuberculosis fragments driving high levels of gfp expression were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). DNA sequencing and subsequent comparison with the M. tuberculosis genome sequence revealed that a total of nine postulated promoters had been identified. The majority of the promoters displayed activity that was {{greater than or equal}} to the Mycobacterium fortuitum b-lactamase promoter, one of the strongest mycobacterial promoters characterized to date. Two of the promoters corresponded to proteins predicted to be involved in calcium and magnesium utilization, the importance of such functions for cell physiology suggesting why these two genes are controlled by strong transcription signals. The seven other promoters corresponded to genes encoding proteins of unknown function. Promoter activity was maintained after prolonged incubation within macrophages, implying that these promoters could be used to drive sustained foreign gene expression in vivo. The strength of these expression signals identified could be employed for the overexpression of foreign genes in mycobacteria to aid protein purification and vaccine vector development. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that FACS provides a sensitive and efficient technique to measure and select strong mycobacterial expression signals...|$|E
40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} bioluminescence immunoassay for digoxin {{was developed}} using photoprotein, native aequorin as a label and the site-directed immobilization technique based on avidin/biotin interaction. Aequorin is a bioluminescence protein, originally {{isolated from the}} jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>Victoria</b> and an attractive label in analytical applications because of sensitive detection due to virtually no background bioluminescent signal. Digoxin is a cardioactive drug, and its therapeutic level in serum is at low concentration with very narrow therapeutic index. The aequorin-digoxigenin conjugates were synthesized by the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester method and characterized in terms of bioluminescent residual activity. The resulting dose-response curve shows that the detection limit is 1. 0 × 10 − 10 M and a dynamic range is three orders of magnitude, which was obtained by 1. 0 × 10 − 10 M conjugate and 0. 9 µg/mL anti-digoxin antibody. Three structurally similar molecules to digoxin were examined for their cross-reactivity. None of these three compounds showed any cross-reactivity with digoxin antibody employed in this study. Standard amounts of digoxin corresponding to the therapeutic range were spiked into the each serum solution. Study of the serum matrix effect indicated that correlation coefficient shows good agreement between luminescence light intensity between in buffer and in serum...|$|E
40|$|The {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) are safe microorganisms which are mainly used for the preparation of fermented foods and for probiotic applications. The potential of LAB as live vehicles for the production and delivery of therapeutic molecules such as antigens is also being actively investigated today. However, very {{little is known about}} the fate of live LAB when administered in vivo and about the interaction of these microorganisms with the nasal or gastrointestinal ecosystem. For future applications, it is essential to be able to discriminate the biotherapeutic strain from the endogenous microflora and to unravel the mechanisms underlying the postulated health-beneficial effect. We therefore started to investigate both aspects in a mouse model with two LAB species presently under development as live vaccine vectors, i. e., Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. We have constructed different expression vectors carrying the gfp (green fluorescent protein [GFP]) gene from the jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria,</b> and we found that this visible marker was best expressed when placed under the control of the inducible strong nisA promoter from L. lactis. Notably, a threshold amount of GFP was necessary to obtain a bright fluorescent phenotype. We further demonstrated that fluorescent L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 can be enumerated and sorted by flow cytometry. Moreover, tagging of this strain with GFP allowed us to visualize its phagocytosis by macrophages in vitro and ex vivo and to trace it in the gastrointestinal tract of mice upon oral administration...|$|E
40|$|Ion {{transport}} processes at {{the plasma}} membrane of plant cells are frequently studied by applying membrane-patch voltage-clamp (patch-clamp) electrophysiological techniques to isolated protoplasts. As plants {{are composed of}} many tissues and cell types, and each tissue and cell type may be specialized to a particular function and possess a unique complement of transport proteins, {{it is important to}} certify the anatomical origin of the protoplasts used for patch-clamp studies. This paper describes a general molecular genetic approach to marking specific cell types for subsequent patch-clamp studies and presents a specific example: a comparison of the Kf currents in protoplasts from cortical and stelar cells of Arabidopsis roots. Transgenic Arabidopsis were generated in which the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> was driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter (line mGFP 3). In roots of the transgenic mGFP 3 line, visible fluorescence was restricted to the stele. Protoplasts were generated from roots of the mGFP 3 line and Kf currents in non-fluorescent (cortical/epidermal) and fluorescent (stelar) protoplasts were assayed using patch-clamp techniques. It was found that both the frequency of observing inward rectifying Kf channel (IRC) activity and the relative occurrence of IRC compared to outward rectifying K+ channels were significantly lower in protoplasts from cortical/epidermal cells compared to cells of the stele. The presence of GFP did not affect the occurrence or biophysical properties of KS channels. It is concluded that the generation of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing GFP in a cell-specific fashion is a convenient and reliable way to mark protoplasts derived from contrasting cell types for subsequent patch-clamp studies...|$|E
40|$|Insulin stimulates glucose {{transport}} in adipose {{and muscle}} tissue by stimulating the movement ('translocation') of an intracellular pool of glucose transporters (the Glut 4 isoform) to the plasma membrane. We have engineered {{a series of}} chimaeras between Glut 4 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) from <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> and expressed these proteins in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes by microinjection of plasmid cDNA. In the absence of insulin, GFP-Glut 4 is localized intracellularly within a perinuclear compartment and multiple intracellular punctate structures. In response to insulin, chimaeric GFP-Glut 4 species exhibit a profound redistribution to the cell surface with kinetics comparable with the endogenous protein. The intracellular localization of GFP-Glut 4 overlaps partially with compartments labelled with Texas Red transferrin, but is largely distinct from intracellular structures identified using Lysotracker-Red(R). K(+) -depletion resulted in the accumulation of GFP-Glut 4 at the cell surface, but to an lesser extent than that observed in response to insulin. In contrast with native Glut 4, removal of the insulin stimulus or treatment of insulin-stimulated cells with phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase inhibitors {{did not result in}} re-internalization of the chimaeric GFP-Glut 4 from the plasma membrane, suggesting that the recycling properties of this species differ from the native Glut 4 molecule. We suggest that the recycling pathway utilized by GFP-Glut 4 in the absence of insulin is distinct from that used to internalize GFP-Glut 4 from the plasma membrane after withdrawal of the insulin stimulus, which may reflect distinct pathways for internalization of endogenous Glut 4 in {{the presence or absence of}} insulin...|$|E
40|$|Presently {{there is}} no method {{available}} that allows noninvasive and real-time monitoring of fungal susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> was tested as a potential reporter molecule for this purpose. Aureobasidium pullulans was transformed to express cytosolic GFP using the vector pTEFEGFP (A. J. Vanden Wymelenberg, D. Cullen, R. N. Spear, B. Schoenike, and J. H. Andrews, BioTechniques 23 : 686 – 690, 1997). The transformed strain Ap 1 gfp showed bright fluorescence that was amenable to quantification using fluorescence spectrophotometry. Fluorescence levels in Ap 1 gfp blastospore suspensions were directly proportional {{to the number of}} viable cells determined by CFU plate counts (r 2 > 0. 99). The relationship between cell viability and GFP fluorescence was investigated by adding a range of concentrations of each of the biocides sodium hypochlorite and 2 -n-octylisothiozolin- 3 -one (OIT) to suspensions of Ap 1 gfp blastospores (pH 5 buffer). These biocides each caused a rapid ( 0. 92). Losses of GFP fluorescence and cell viability were highly dependent on external pH; maximum losses of fluorescence and viability occurred at pH 4, while reduction of GFP fluorescence was absent at pH 8. 0 and was associated with a lower reduction in viability. When A. pullulans was attached to the surface of plasticized poly(vinylchloride) containing 500 ppm of OIT, fluorescence decreased more slowly than in cell suspensions, with > 95 % loss of fluorescence after 27 h. This technique should have broad applications in testing the susceptibility of A. pullulans and other fungal species to antimicrobial compounds...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Current filter validation methods require 48 hours culture for results to become available, which creates time delays within the manufacturing process and quality control back-logs The thesis compares alternative methods {{for the production of}} filter challenge test data Within 24 hours to the desired test sensitivity, using bioluminescent and fluorescent genetically engineered strains of the test organism Brevundzmonas dzmznuta The recombinant strains were produced using a Tn 5 transposon system, using a filter mating method. The genes cloned into the bacterial chromosome were the biolummescence lux_ genes, taken from the marme bacteria, Photorhabdus lummescens or Vzbno harveyz, and the gene encoding green fluorescent protein taken from the marine jelly fish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> The cloned strains were found to show no difference to the w 1 ld type strain With respect to their surface hydrophobicity, according to a bacterial adherence to hydrocarbons assay, and surface charge, according to an electro-static interaction chromatography method. Furthermore, the cell size according to Transmission Electron Microscopy was not significantly different to the wild type strain, which had cell dimensions of 1 05 x 0 52 Jlm The retention of cells by 0 45 mtcron rated filters, was shown to be not significantly different to the wild type All strains were retained by 0 2 Jlm filters These data confirmed that the cloned strains were suitable for challenge testing Four methods were used to detect microcolonies of the recombinant strains on filters. The advantage of the microcolony detection system was that it showed that the cells detected downstream of the filter were viable and culturable. The best detection method was with an epifluorescent microscope and the fluorescent strain after 24 hours, for which the sensitivity was 98. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Non-invasive autofluorescent {{reporters have}} {{revolutionized}} lineage labeling in {{an array of}} different organisms. In recent years green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the bioluminescent jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>Victoria</b> has gained popularity in mouse transgenic and gene targeting regimes 1. It offers several advantages over conventional gene-based reporters, such as lacZ and alkaline phosphatase, in that its visualization does not require a chromogenic substrate and can be realized in vivo. We have previously demonstrated the utility and developmental neutrality of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in embryonic stem (ES) cells and mice 2. Results In this study we have used embryonic stem (ES) cell-mediated transgenesis to test the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), two mutant and spectrally distinct color variants of wild type (wt) GFP. We have also tested DsRed 1, the novel red fluorescent protein reporter recently cloned from the Discostoma coral by virtue of its homology to GFP. To this end, we have established lines of ES cells together with viable and fertile mice having widespread expression of either the ECFP or EYFP GFP-variant reporters. However, we were unable to generate equivalent DsRed 1 lines, suggesting that DsRed 1 is not developmentally neutral or that transgene expression cannot be sustained constitutively. Balanced (diploid diploid) and polarized (tetraploid diploid) chimeras comprising combinations of the ECFP and EYFP ES cells and/or embryos, demonstrate that populations of cells expressing each individual reporter can be distinguished within a single animal. Conclusions GFP variant reporters are unique in allowing non-invasive multi-spectral visualization in live samples. The ECFP and EYFP-expressing transgenic ES cells and mice that we have generated provide sources of cells and tissues for combinatorial, double-tagged recombination experiments, chimeras or transplantations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Author for {{correspondence}} The cloning of {{the green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> and its expression in heterologous systems was a significant advance for optical microscopy of living cells (Chalfie et al., 1994). Mutagenesis of jellyfish GFP has yielded proteins that fluoresce from blue to yellowish green, and genetic manipulations have generated GFP variants that are better suited for fluorescence microscopy than wild-type GFP and have optimized codon usage (Tsien, R. Y., 1998). For example, a green color variant of Aequoria GFP (EGFP) has been extensively used as an in vivo reporter because of its high quantum yield and resistance to photobleaching. However, the useful cyan fluorescent variant (ECFP) has low absorption and low quantum yield, whereas the yellowish-green fluorescent protein (EYFP) has the highest absorption and quantum yield but is more susceptible to photobleaching than are most other mutants. The recent cloning of a gene that encodes a red fluorescent protein (dsRed) from the Indo-Pacific sea anemone Discosoma striata has provided yet another fluorescent protein that is further red-shifted (Matz, M. V. et al. 1999). The dsRed shares only ~ 25 % sequence identity with Aequoria GFP; other usable GFPs are therefore likely to be discovered in the future. Several limitations {{to the use of}} dsRed have been identified, including slow protein maturation and a strong tendency to form tetramers (Baird, G. S., et al. 2000). The poster shows excitation and emission spectra determined for each fluorescent protein (excitation spectra are shown in lighter shades). Methods for purification and characterization of fluorescent proteins are described in detail elsewhere (Piston et al. 1999). Briefly, the cDNA of each GFP was subcloned to produce an N-terminal His 6 fusion protein. His 6 -tagged GFPs were expressed in E. coli grown at 37 °C, an...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} cloning and subsequent engineering {{of the green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish <b>Aequoria</b> <b>victoria</b> allowed a novel approach to the investigation of cell signalling. GFP and its mutants can now not only be used to target specific organelles in living cells but also function {{as a basis for}} a variety of sensors for biologically important ions and molecular interactions. GFP-based Ca 2 +- sensors have been successfully used for studies in mammalian and plant cells. In filamentous fungi, however, they have not yet been reported to work. Since only little is known about calcium signalling in filamentous fungi, this project aimed to improve existing GFP-based Ca 2 +- sensors by exchanging the original fluorophores for improved versions and expressing those in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. During this project, the donor and acceptor fluorophores of 3 existing Ca 2 +-FRETprobes based on cameleons and troponin C-sensors, have been changed, 2 novel positive FRET controls have been designed and these, as well as donor and acceptor fluorophores alone, have been expressed in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. The probes were assessed using different imaging techniques, such as conventional confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and spectral imaging using a Leica TSC SP 5 confocal and IRIS, a novel spectral imaging device designed at Heriot Watt University. Problems were encountered that prevented FRET analysis using CLSM and IRIS. These were due mainly to the difference in expression level of the constructs and the distribution of the emission bandpasses of the IRIS system. Analysis of the spectral data obtained on the Leica confocal system and analysis of the FLIM results, however, revealed significant differences between the donor only and the positive FRET controls. Spectra of the positive FRET controls and the Ca 2 +-sensitive probes showed emission peaks of both the donor and the acceptor fluorophores upon excitation of the donor fluorophore alone while analysis of the FLIM results revealed an additional decay component in the positive FRET controls. Both results are very strong indicators that we can detect FRET in living hyphae of Aspergillus niger transformed with the probes designed during this project.
