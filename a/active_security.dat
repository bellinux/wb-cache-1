This software was developed by Kaspersky Lab. Active Virus Shield software was free and did not require an AOL account, only an internet email address. The ISP side of AOL UK was bought by The Carphone Warehouse in October 2006 to take advantage of their 100,000 LLU customers, making The Carphone Warehouse the biggest LLU provider in the UK.|$|E

The bypass switch or bypass tap removes this point of failure by automatically 'switching traffic via bypass mode' to keep the critical network link up.|$|E

It {{is known as the}} 'premier secure job board focused exclusively on candidates with active or current U.S. government security clearances.' ClearanceJobs is owned by DHI Group, Inc. (formerly known as Dice Holdings, Inc.) (NYSE: DHX). The website ClearanceJobs.com typically has more than 10,500 security clearance job listings, but companies frequently use the site to search for candidates, rather than posting jobs. In 2004 ClearanceJobs had 13,984 registered job seekers; in 2007, 95,000 job seekers with <b>active</b> federal <b>security</b> clearances. By April, 2011 the site had more than 375,000 registered cleared job seekers. Today, the website claims to have more than 678,000 registered security-cleared professionals. All registered users must have an <b>active</b> federal <b>security</b> clearance. Careers listed on the site range from custodial worker to counterintelligence analyst and cyber counterterrorism targeting analyst. The site has been used by hundreds of private companies as well as federal government agencies including defense companies, the CIA, FBI, Federal Reserve and Department of Homeland Security.|$|R

50|$|The {{approach}} {{that so far}} {{seems to be the}} most fruitful in obtaining <b>active</b> <b>security</b> comes from a combination of the garbling technique and the “cut-and-choose” paradigm. This combination seems to render more efficient constructions. To avoid the aforementioned problems with respect to dishonest behaviour, many garblings of the same circuit are sent from the constructor to the evaluator. Then around half of them (depending on the specific protocol) are opened to check consistency, and if so a vast majority of the unopened ones are correct with high probability. The output is the majority vote of all the evaluations. Note that here the majority output is needed. If there is disagreement on the outputs the receiver knows the sender is cheating, but he cannot complain as otherwise this would leak information on his input.|$|E
50|$|Since {{security}} against active adversaries {{is often}} only possible {{at the cost}} of reducing efficiency one is led to consider a relaxed form of <b>active</b> <b>security</b> called covert security, proposed by Aumann and Lindell. Covert security captures more realistic situations, where active adversaries are willing to cheat but only if they are not caught. For example, their reputation could be damaged, preventing future collaboration with other honest parties. Thus, protocols that are covertly secure provide mechanisms to ensure that, if some of the parties do not follow the instructions, then it will be noticed with high probability, say 75% or 90%. In a way, covert adversaries are active ones forced to act passively due to external non-cryptographic (e.g. business) concerns. This sets a bridge between the two models in the hope of finding protocols, which are efficient yet secure enough for practice.|$|E

30|$|To {{confront the}} {{aforementioned}} challenges, this paper proposes Security-first Architecture, a concept which enforces systematic and active defenses using <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> Processors. In systems built {{based on this}} concept, traditional processors (i.e., Computation Processors) are monitored and protected by <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> Processors. The two types of processors execute on their own physically-isolated resources, including memory, disks, network and I/O devices.

This allows the <b>Active</b> <b>Security</b> Processors to actively detect and tackle malicious activities in the Computation Processors with minimum performance degradation while protecting themselves from the attacks launched from the Computation Processors thanks to the resource isolation.|$|E
