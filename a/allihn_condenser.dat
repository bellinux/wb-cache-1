2500|$|The <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser</b> or [...] "bulb condenser" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "reflux condenser" [...] {{is named after}} Felix Richard Allihn (1854–1915). The <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser</b> {{consists}} of a long glass tube with a water jacket. [...] A series of bulbs on the tube increases the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense. Ideally suited for laboratory-scale refluxing.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, a {{condenser}} is the apparatus which cools hot vapors, {{causing them to}} condense into a liquid. See [...] "Condenser (laboratory)" [...] for laboratory-scale condensers, as opposed to industrial-scale condensers. Examples include the Liebig condenser, Graham condenser, and <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser.</b> This {{is not to be}} confused with a condensation reaction which links two fragments into a single molecule by an addition reaction and an elimination reaction.|$|E
50|$|In {{laboratory}} distillation, {{several types}} of condensers are commonly found. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a water jacket, and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser</b> has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense.|$|E
50|$|In {{laboratory}} distillation, reflux, and rotary evaporators, {{several types}} of condensers are commonly used. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a cooling water jacket, and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser</b> has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense. Being more complex shapes to manufacture, these latter types are also more expensive to purchase. These three types of condensers are laboratory glassware items since they are typically made of glass. Commercially available condensers usually are fitted with ground glass joints and come in standard lengths of 100, 200, and 400 mm. Air-cooled condensers are unjacketed, while water-cooled condensers contain a jacket for the water.|$|E
30|$|To {{prepare the}} water extract of the biomass, 5  g of dry biomass was {{transferred}} to a pre-weighed, tarred and dry cellulose thimble which {{was placed in a}} Soxhlet extractor connected to a collection flask containing 200  ml distilled water. An <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser</b> was fitted on the boiling flask and cool water was run through the condenser. Upon completion in 10  h, the water from the extractor body was collected in a flask (Sluiter et al. 2008). The water extract was weighed and stored in the freezer until use in the antibacterial analysis and inhibition zone analysis.|$|E
30|$|Optimization of {{sediment}} digestion to achieve quantitative dissolution of TN and a colorless sediment {{was carried out}} by the method of alkaline persulfate digestion (Worsfold et al. 2005) using Cd reduction. The mass of K 2 S 2 O 8 used for digesting a constant mass of the same homogenized sediment was increased from 0.3 to 2.1  g in 0.3 -g increments. For the first experiment, 0.5  g {{of sediment}} was weighed into a 100 -mL digestion flask, and subsequently, 2  mL of 0.3  M NaOH solution and 0.3  g of K 2 S 2 O 8 were added to it. An <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser</b> was fixed to the digestion flask, and {{the upper end of the}} condenser was corked and the coolant water flowing through the condenser was at approximately 2 – 3  °C and pumped by a water-circulation pump (Zhengzhou Greatwall, SHB-III, China). The digestion was carried out on a preheated magnetic stirrer (Jincheng Guosheng, 78 – 1, China) at 110  °C for 2  h. Each successive experiment had 0.3  g more K 2 S 2 O 8. After digestion, 1 drop of phenolphthalein indicator was added and the solution was carefully neutralized to a faint pink with 1.5  M NaOH. It was diluted to 100  mL in a volumetric flask and filtered with Whatman no. 540 filter paper. The TN absorbance of each solution was measured.|$|E
30|$|All the {{chemicals}} {{were obtained from}} LachNer Ltd., Neratovice, Penta Ltd., Chrudim, (Czech Republic) and SigmaAldrich Co., Steinheim (Germany). South Moravian lignite (kindly provided by Lignit Hodonín Ltd., Mikulčice, Czech Republic) was regenerated with two oxidizing agents – nitric acid (abbreviated as N) and hydrogen peroxide (abbreviated as P) in concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 65  vol% and 5, 10, 20, 30  vol%, respectively. The lignite:oxidizing agent ratio was 1 : 10 w/w (50  g of parental lignite in 500  mL of regeneration agent). Lignite was treated for 30  minutes at a temperature around 30 °C in a glass beaker. For the 50 and 65  vol% nitric acid treatment a round bottom flask with a reflux <b>Allihn</b> <b>condenser</b> and a cooling bath were used, since the regeneration reactions were strongly exothermic. The mixture was filtered and the filtration cake of treated lignite was used for extraction of regenerated humate. A quantity of 40  g of lignite was subjected to extraction via a slightly modified process published by Swift (1996). It involved an alkaline extraction {{with a mixture of}} 0.5  mol L– 1 sodium hydroxide and 0.1  mol L– 1 sodium pyrophosphate. The lignite:agent ratio was 1 : 10 w/w. Separation was achieved by centrifugation for 15  min at 15 °C and 4000  rpm with Rotina 46 R centrifuge (Andreas Hettich Ltd., Tuttingen, Germany), and precipitation by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Further purification included removal of silicate residues with 5  vol% hydrofluoric acid and dialysis against deionized water through a SpectraPor 1000  Da cutoff dialysis membrane made of regenerated cellulose (Spectrum Labs Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, U.S.A.).|$|E
