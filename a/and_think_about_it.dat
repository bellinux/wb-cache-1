500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you stop <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E

50|$|Thus a jurist, {{someone who}} studies, {{analyses}} and comments on law, stands {{in contrast with}} a lawyer, someone who applies law on behalf of clients <b>and</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in practical terms.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's sport {{enough for}} us," [...] {{returned}} Jack. [...] "I don't {{know what the}} rabbits <b>and</b> squirrels <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> though," [...] he added dryly.|$|R

6000|$|... "But the Duke wouldn't {{really let}} it, you know. I'll lay {{awake at night}} <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And now tell me about Adelaide Palliser. Is she to be married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't see that. I must {{talk about}} it, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> too. If I {{can put up}} with Mr Brehgert I don't see why you and mamma should complain.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If you are {{thinking}} about the property, aunt, wipe {{it out of your}} mind. Let him do what he pleases <b>and</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> No one should trouble their minds <b>about</b> such things. <b>It</b> is his, to do what he pleases with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, no, Miss Monnerie," [...] I {{hastened to}} explain, [...] "not me. It isn't my story, though I was in it--and to blame. But please, {{if you would}} be so kind, don't mention it again to Mrs Monnerie, <b>and</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|The bright {{sunshine}} dazzled his eyes, {{the passing}} vehicles and foot-passengers startled and bewildered him. He shrank into a by-street, {{and put his}} hand over his eyes.

60|$|In {{the first}} place he must get away <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all, think himself clear of all these--these immediacies, these {{associations}} and relations and holds and habits.

60|$|But {{the most}} right sort of thought, after all, is {{thought about what}} lies nearest us; not always, but surely once in a way, that we may {{understand}} something of everyday objects.

5000|$|There is a {{significant}} difference between asking a Tahitian interviewee something like [...] "Please describe for me exactly how and why supercision (a penis-mutilating rite of passage) is done by Tahitians," [...] and asking him [...] "Can you tell me <b>about</b> your supercision?"..."Did <b>it</b> change your life in any way?"

500|$|As for Feldman's road to {{the major}} leagues, [...] "The dream started off like any other kid", Feldman said.

5000|$|In Reviews in American History, Henry F.

[...] He also however criticizes Bloom for being [...] "unabashedly subjective and sometimes wrong-headed" [...] and using [...] "sweeping generalizations".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must have}} my fling, Richard," [...] he answered, laughing; [...] "I {{shall not be}} a gentleman long. I must {{know how it feels}} to take your ease, and stroke your velvet, and order lackeys about. And when my money is gone I shall be content to go to sea again, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> o' stormy nights." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Mr. Pickwick, as Sam and his {{companion}} drew nigh, 'you will see how your health becomes, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> meanwhile.

You are tired, and {{not strong enough to}} be out long.' ...|$|E
60|$|He rambled {{through the}} scenes of his old pursuits--through many where Florence lost him as she listened--sometimes for hours. He would repeat that childish question, 'What is money?' and ponder on it, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and reason with himself, more or less connectedly, for a good answer; {{as if it had}} never been {{proposed}} to him until that moment. He would go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm twenty thousand times, and at every one of them, would turn his head upon his pillow. He would count his children--one--two--stop, and go back, and begin again in the same way.|$|E
50|$|AugustWntr's {{personality}} often {{reflects his}} name changes and musical sound. He is sporadic, odd, and genuine. He says {{what he means}} <b>and</b> doesn't <b>think</b> twice <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's a chance," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "that seldom {{comes to}} a man; an {{opportunity}} to tell a man exactly what his friends <b>and</b> neighbors <b>think</b> <b>about</b> him. <b>It's</b> a rare experience, and I like it. I'll do it." ...|$|R
30|$|But if {{you stop}} <b>and</b> really <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Microsoft the company is {{probably}} more of a marvel of human creativity and ingenuity than any of its products. Before Gates and Allen started Microsoft, pure software companies didn’t exist. Gates identified a business opportunity in what most computer companies saw as a necessary but nettlesome accoutrement to the hardware that pulled in the big bucks. In the end he created a masterpiece (Stewart et al. 1999).|$|R
60|$|Except when a {{constrained}} and singular reserve crept over her; {{and then}} she seemed (but Florence hardly understood this, though she could not choose but notice it, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it)</b> {{as if she were}} humbled before Florence, and ill at ease. When she had said that she was not her Mama yet, and when Florence had called her the mistress of everything there, this change in her was quick and startling; and now, while the eyes of Florence rested on her face, she sat as though she would have shrunk and hidden from her, rather than as one about to love and cherish her, in right of such a near connexion.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't, Master. I {{might think}} it of some men, but never of you. I don't for a minute think that you would do her or any woman any wilful wrong. But you may do her great harm for all that. I want you to stop <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I guess you haven't thought. Kilmeny can't know {{anything}} about the world or about men, and she may get to thinking too much of you. That might break her heart, because you couldn't ever marry a dumb girl like her. So I don't think you ought to be meeting her so often in this fashion. It isn't right, Master. Don't go to the orchard again." ...|$|E
6000|$|While Kennicott labored over {{ordering}} it was annoying {{to see him}} {{permit the}} waiter to be impertinent, but as the cocktail elevated her to a bridge among colored stars, as the oysters came in--not canned oysters in the Gopher Prairie fashion, but on the half-shell--she cried, [...] "If you only knew how wonderful {{it is not to}} have had to plan this dinner, and order it at the butcher's and fuss <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and then watch Bea cook it! I feel so free. And to have new kinds of food, and different patterns of dishes and linen, and not worry about whether the pudding is being spoiled! Oh, this is a great moment for me!" ...|$|E
60|$|Emily and Lilias kindly avoided {{looking at}} Jane, who, after fidgeting on {{her chair and}} turning very red, succeeded in regaining outward composure. She {{resolved}} to let the matter die away, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> no more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a terrible}} moment," [...] Mr. Hudson said. [...] "But I agree, with Frances, {{that it is better}} for you to try <b>and</b> <b>think</b> nothing more <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> until you have {{perfectly}} recovered your health and spirits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Clara, you {{surprise}} me. But women {{never understand}} delicacy {{in regard to}} money. They have so {{little to do with}} <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> so little <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> that they have no occasion for such delicacy." ...|$|R
60|$|These {{performances}} {{took place}} {{on the site of the}} future town of Napoleon, Arkansas, and there the first confiscation-cross was raised on the banks of the great river. Marquette's and Joliet's voyage of discovery ended at the same spot--the site of the future town of Napoleon. When De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river, away back in the dim early days, he took it from that same spot--the site of the future town of Napoleon, Arkansas. Therefore, three out of the four memorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the mighty river, occurred, by accident, in one and the same place. It is a most curious distinction, when one comes to look at it <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> France stole that vast country on that spot, the future Napoleon; and by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back again!--make restitution, not to the owners, but to their white American heirs.|$|E
60|$|It {{follows from}} this very {{directly}} {{that only one}} thing can end war on the earth {{and that is a}} subtle mental development, an idea, the development of the idea of the world commonweal in the collective mind. The only real method of abolishing war is to perceive it, to realize it, to express it, to think it out <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> to make all the world understand its significance, and to clear and preserve its significant functions. In human affairs to understand an evil is to abolish it; {{it is the only way}} to abolish any evil that arises out of the untutored nature of man. Which brings me back here again to my already repeated persuasion, that in expressing things, rendering things to each other, discussing our differences, clearing up the metaphysical conceptions upon which differences are discussed, and in a phrase evolving the collective mind, lies not only the cures of war and poverty but the general form of all a man's duty and the essential work of mankind.|$|E
60|$|The {{twilight}} {{had come}} on, {{and it was}} quickly growing dusk, but the path was so familiar to her from frequent traversing that she hardly thought of this, and certainly felt no uneasiness at being left alone. Moreover, there was the bracelet to admire; and when she had given it a good rub, {{and held it out}} at arm's length, it sparkled and glittered so beautifully on her wrist, that to look at it in every point of view and with every possible turn of the arm, was quite an absorbing business. There was the letter too, and it looked so mysterious and knowing, when she took it out of her pocket, and it held, as she knew, so much inside, that to turn it over and over, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and wonder how it began, and how it ended, and what it said all through, was another matter of constant occupation. Between the bracelet and the letter, there was quite enough to do without thinking of anything else; and admiring each by turns, Dolly went on gaily.|$|E
5000|$|The song's title {{comes from}} the heartfelt passage, Core, core 'ngrato, te haie pigliato 'a vita mia! Tutt' è passato, e nun nce pienze cchiù!, which approximates in English to [...] "Ungrateful heart, you have stolen my life! It's all over <b>and</b> I don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> anymore!".|$|R
500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at the time. When she told Lennon he said, [...] "There's only one thing for it Cyn, we'll have to get married".|$|R
