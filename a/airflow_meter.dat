40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new strategy}} using {{a limited number of}} sensors for demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) of multi-zone office buildings. The conventional CO 2 -based demand-controlled ventilation strategy for multi-zone offices requires CO 2 sensors and supply <b>airflow</b> <b>meters</b> being installed in all zones. However, in many practical cases, CO 2 sensors might not be available or not necessary. To control the outdoor airflow based on actual occupancy variations in such cases, a DCV strategy with two implementing schemes is developed for different sensor availabilities. The first scheme is used for the situation when CO 2 sensors in individual zones are not available but the <b>airflow</b> <b>meters</b> for individual zones are installed. The second scheme is used for the conditions when CO 2 sensors and <b>airflow</b> <b>meters</b> in individual zones are not available. These two schemes use two different approaches to estimate the outdoor airflow fraction of the critical zone approximately. Both schemes only require the CO 2 sensor in the main return air to dynamically detect the total occupancy number. The developed strategy is implemented and validated in a high-rise office building in Hong Kong. The site test results show that the strategy can achieve significant energy saving while maintaining acceptable IAQ in the situations where only limited sensors are available.

This study: (i) developed a new methodology for simulating filter loading in-situ; (ii) observed the impact of filter loading on AC performance in-situ; and (iii) provided a greater understanding of when a filter is “dirty” and should be replaced. Six central AC systems in the Atlanta metro-region were evaluated. Filter loading was simulated by installing the TrueFlow® <b>airflow</b> <b>metering</b> device and partially taping off the face at 3 different increments. This resulted in measurements at 5 discrete static pressures (no filter, TrueFlow, TrueFlow Taped one, TrueFlow Taped two, and TrueFlow Taped three). The pilot study found that as filter pressure drop increased, airflow rates generally decreased, resulting in higher differences in temperature across the evaporator coil (∆T). There was no observed correlation between absolute humidity across the evaporator coil and either filter pressure drop or system airflow. Overall, as airflow decreased so did sensible, latent, and total capacity. This research can inform decisions about filter replacement and be used to evaluate computer simulation models of HVAC performance. M. S...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{research}} {{presented in}} this article evaluated a technique using manure additives (Sporzyme and activated sludge) coupled with aeration treatment in reducing nutrients from liquid swine manure. Plastic columns, 91. 6 cm in height and 15. 3 cm in internal diameter, were each filled with 15 L liquid swine manure. Aeration was provided to each column by an air pump at an airflow rate of 2. 0 L/min, controlled by individual <b>airflow</b> <b>meters</b> mounted on the columns. The experiment included five treatments: (1) control (no aeration and no additives), (2) aeration alone, (3) aeration with a microbial additive (Sporzyme), (4) aeration with activated sludge inoculum without anaerobic incubation prior to aeration, and (5) aeration with activated sludge inoculum with three days of anaerobic incubation prior to aeration. The results indicated that total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia-N, and total soluble phosphorus were reduced by about 42 %, 56 %, and 72 %, respectively, by all the treatments except the control. The reduction of TKN was found to be mainly attributed to the reduction of ammonia because its share of TKN was remarkably reduced {{at the end of the}} test. Although Sporzyme significantly increases the aerobic count in the manure, data from this study have showed no advantage of its use (or the activated sludge as seeding) solely for enhancing nutrient reduction in swine manure under aeration treatment since there was little difference found in terms of either nitrogen or phosphorus reduction between treatments with and without additives...|$|R

The management of modern datacenters is rapidly exceeding human ability, making autonomic approaches essential. In this article, methods for acquiring thermal awareness using real-time measurements and heat and air circulation models as well as solutions for proactive autonomic datacenter management that exploit this awareness are discussed. Novel communication and coordination schemes that enable self-organization of a network of external heterogeneous sensors (e. g., thermal cameras, scalar temperature and humidity sensors, <b>airflow</b> <b>meters)</b> into a multitier sensing infrastructure capable of real-time datacenter monitoring are also presented. D atacenters are a growing component of society’s information technology (IT) infrastructure, enabling services related to health, banking, commerce, defense, education, and entertainment. Due to the rise in demand for computing and storage, energy consumption, heat generation, and cooling requirements of datacenters have become critical concerns in terms of both the growing operating costs as well as their environmental and societal impacts. It is predicted that datacenter energy consumption in the United States will reach 100 billion kWh/year by the end of 2011 with a corresponding energy bill of approximately $ 7. 4 billion [1]. Impact on the environment and society may include increase in CO 2 emissions, overload of the electricity supply grid, and rising water usage for cooling leading to water scarcity.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [98]- 99) High <b>airflow</b> <b>meters</b> in {{the range}} of 0. 0 SLM (Standard Liters Per Minute) to 200. 0 SLM and using a built-in microbridge sensor in flow housing, induce a significant amount of turbulence noise on the output signal. This imposes severe constraints on the flowmeter performance. Therefore, investigative work was carried out {{to determine the extent of}} the problem. The resultant tests show that turbulent noise is highest (± 800 mv with no flow screens) when airflow is from 0. 0 SLM to 100. 0 SLM. The lowest signal noise ratio is 5. 45 db. The objective of this paper is to analyze the sensor output signal and introduce an analog/digital filter design to reduce the random noise and to realize the industrial standard voltage output range of 1. 00 VDC to 5. 00 VDC. The unique and variable characteristics of the flow noise are presented in very detail. Tests were performed with the A/D data acquisition system for flow data analysis and the flow data file was used for off-line time and frequency domain analysis and digital filter design simulation. Frequency and time domain measurements were obtained in real-time from a series of flow tests with this heat transfer type flowmeter. Magnitude of the signal were measured. The mean and the autocorrelation were calculated and measured as the important information of noise induced on the output signal. Analog Butterworth filter was implemented on this high flow meter for real time signal processing, signal noise ratio is improved; overshoot is 1 0 %; and the response time is 350 ms. Simulations were done on traditional Butterworth digital filter design and Adaptive Noise Cancellation and Forward Linear Predictor strategy. The Forward Linear Prediction application was implemented with the TMS 320 C 25 digital signal processor (DSP), signal noise ratio is higher than signal noise ratio of analog filter; overshoot is zero; and response time is 195 ms. The effectiveness of these filter designs are presented for a wide range of airflows.

50|$|There {{is still}} some open debate on this issue, but some believe that a problem with short ram air intakes is that the air {{entering}} the intake is at a higher temperature due to {{the proximity of the}} engine, which may reduce some power. This may be partially offset by an increase in the volume of air entering the engine. To counter intake heat problems, many short ram intakes include some form of heat shield. Moving the intake inlet port further away from the engine block will also help to alleviate the problem and some users use a cold air intake where the inlet air is at or close to ambient temperature. However, others claim that Short Ram Intakes (SRIs) or similar Warm Air Intakes (WAIs) offer benefits over Cold Air Intakes (CAIs) which include better MPG due to a more complete burning of fuel. Users with forced induction engines often opt for short ram intakes because compressors adjacent to the engine, especially turbochargers, heat the incoming air and negate much of the benefits of a cold air intake. Additional problems can result from using a short ram intake in cars utilizing a mass airflow sensor though most of today's sensors automatically adjust without issue. Turbulence in the intake airflow produced by the filter or piping, or a change in intake diameter {{at the point where the}} airflow is measured can produce inaccurate airflow readings. The error in airflow then translates to an error in the amount of added fuel. In the worst case, the air/fuel ratio can run lean, causing detonation and possibly engine failure although the airflow sensor will generally detect and correct the throttle to compensate for the warmer air. This can also be solved by modifying/elongating the intake piping, replacing the <b>airflow</b> <b>meter,</b> or by replacing/remapping the engine control computer to provide the correct amount of fuel for the intake airflow at all engine speeds.|$|E
40|$|Airtightness of the {{building}} envelope is a key factor for good performance of a building. The main part of this thesis deals with the exploration of a transient pressurisation method for air leakage measurements. In the transient method, an enclosure is pressurised to a desired pressure. The air flow into the enclosure is then stopped. The pressure starts to decline due to air leakage through {{the walls of the}} enclosure. The pressure decline is measured. The air leakage rate, {{as a function of the}} excess pressure, is obtained from a formula that involves the time derivative of the pressure. The formula also involves air heat capacity, potential volume change due to excess pressure, and heat exchange between air and enclosure. The main benefit of the method, compared to the static method, is that it eliminates the need of <b>airflow</b> <b>meters.</b> It also gives a continuous relation between pressure and air leakage rate. The method is validated against the common static method, and against empirical values of air leakage through sharp-edged openings. The agreement is very good. The development of the method involves studies and analysis of curve fitting, volume change, heat flux, and oscillations due to inertia of the airflow. The particular complication of an unknown volume change is overcome by performing two measurements, one without and one with an added opening with known leakage. The method is applied to cases of air leakage through a wood frame wall, an attic floor and a knee wall construction. The measurements are performed in a laboratory environment. The results from these measurements show that the method can be used also in cases of large and non-linear volume change of the enclosure. Transient opening and closing of leakage paths may be detected. The testing of {{the building}} components also show that it is quite easy to make these components sufficiently airtight, with moderate efforts only. The method is also applied to air leakage through well-defined leakage paths. Air leakage through these paths is also simulated with a CFD-tool. Simulations and measurements show in most cases very good agreement. In cases involving porous materials, even a small void in the insulation near an inlet or outlet opening may have a large impact on the air leakage rate. A second part of the thesis deals with modelling of air leakage in a single-family house. The modelling shows that the ventilation system has a large impact on the result. The models also show that wind is a mitigating factor, in most cases, regarding transport of indoor air to the attic. In cases of indoor air transport to the attic it is necessary to ventilate the attic. In a climate similar to the one in Gothenburg, ventilation of an attic can, however, cause moisture problems.

After that, a cost-effective virtual supply <b>airflow</b> (SCFM) <b>meter</b> for rooftop air-conditioning units (RTUs) is created by using a first-principle model in combination with accurate measurements of virtual or virtually calibrated temperature sensors (a virtual mixed air temperature sensor and a virtually calibrated supply air temperature sensor) as a supplementary example. Modeling of the virtual meter, uncertainty analysis, and experimental evaluation are performed through a wide range of laboratory testing in the development. The study reveals that the first-principle based virtual SCFM meter could accurately predict SCFM values for RTUs (uncertainty is ± 6. 9 %). This innovative application is promising with a number of merits, such as high cost-effectiveness, ease-of-implementation, long-term availability after one-time development, and generic characteristics for all RTUs with gas heating.

The impact of neuromuscular blockade remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that neuromuscular blockade leads to a decrease in FRC and increase in lung clearance index (LCI) while the application of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cmH(2) O leads to a restoration in both parameters. METHODS: After approval of the local Ethics Committee, we studied 18 preschool children (2 - 6 years) without cardiopulmonary disease, who were scheduled for elective surgery.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. As aero gas turbine designs strive for ever greater {{efficiencies}} {{the trend is}} for engine overall pressure ratios to rise. Although this provides greater thermal efficiency it means that cycle temperatures also increase. Traditionally turbines have {{been the focus of}} cooling schemes to enable them to survive high temperatures. However, it is envisaged that the compressor delivery air will soon reach temperatures which mean they may require similar cooling strategies to the turbine. One such concept is akin to that of a turbine 'rim purge flow which ensures that hot, mainstream flow does not get ingested into rotor cavities. However, the main gas path in compressors is generally more aerodynamically sensitive than in turbines and introduction of a purge flow may be more penalizing. It is important to understand the impact such a flow may have on the primary gas path flow of a compressor and the downstream combustion system aerodynamics. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the effects of a purge flow which enters the main gas path immediately upstream of the high pressure compressor outlet guide vane (OGV) row. Initial, simplified, CFD predictions clearly demonstrated the potential of the purge flow to negatively affect the OGV/pre-diffuser and alter the inlet conditions to the combustion system. Consequently, an experimental assessment was carried out using an existing fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, engine relevant outlet guide vanes, pre-diffuser and downstream combustor geometry. Using CFD to guide the process the test rig was modified to allow a <b>metered</b> <b>airflow</b> to be introduced upstream of the outlet guide vanes. Importantly the flow was directed up the face of the rotor such that it picked up a representative swirl component prior to injection into the main gas path. The experimental data confirmed the CFD results and importantly demonstrated that the degradation in the combustor inlet flow resulted in an increased combustion system loss. At the proposed purge flow rate, equal to ∼ 1 % of the mainstream flow, these effects were small with the system loss increasing by ∼ 4 %. However, at higher purge flow rates (up to 3 %) these effects became notable and the OGV/pre-diffuser flow degraded significantly with a resultant increase in the combustion system loss of ∼ 13 %...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{microscale}} windfields computations over complex topography {{is crucial}} to many particle transport models but remains a challenging task. The objective of this work focuses on the numerical simulations of micro-scale windfields over the steep Gaudergrat ridge, located in the Swiss Alps. These windfields are computed {{with the objective of}} driving a snowdrift model, consequently the work concentrates on meteorological situations close to snow storms. As snow transport occurs in the first meters above the surface, this implies a very fine resolution of order tens of <b>meters.</b> <b>Airflow</b> simulations are performed using the meteorological model ARPS (Advanced Regional Prediction System), which is based on a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) formulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The turbulent airflow features {{play an important role in}} the transport of particles. Therefore ARPS turbulence models, the Smagorinsky-Lilly and the 1. 5 order Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) closures, have been examined in neutral atmosphere conditions over flat terrain. ARPS mechanical turbulence schemes has hence been tested and the parameters of the Subgrid-Scales (SGS) models have been tuned. ARPS has already been proven suitable for reproducing qualitative features of airflow and over complex alpine terrain with a careful choice of the artificial initialisation and periodic boundary conditions. When lateral periodic boundary conditions are applied for airflow computations over real complex topography, instabilities arise quickly. For a quantitative and stable description of airflow presented in this work, the initialisation and boundary conditions have consequently been improved. In this study, the simulations over the Gaudergrat ridge presented are performed a one-way nesting approach. ARPS is first driven by the outputs of the MeteoSwiss model aLMo which produce initial and time dependent lateral boundary conditions. Then the application of the nesting technique permit to bridge spatial resolutions from 7 km (aLMo grid resolution) to 25 m (horizontal resolution in the finer ARPS grid). Such a fine resolution is also required for Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) configuration and it is expected that a large part of the energy is resolved explicitly. The nesting technique has been applied to reproduce two selected days during the Gaudergrat Experiment (Gaudex) with stronger wind, to have conditions as close as possible to winter conditions and when thermal winds are weak. The field measurement campaign, Gaudergrat Experiment (Gaudex), in collaboration with the University of Leeds, was held from June to October 2003 at the Gaudergrat ridge, near Davos, Switzerland. The collected data are used to develop a better understanding of the airflow characteristics and turbulence features as well as to check the model results. The comparison with field data show satisfactory results for the mean flow quantities, whereas the lateral boundary condition forcing suppresses the small scales turbulent motion. A simple method is proposed to spin up turbulent motions in the finer resolution domain. This method is based on the introduction of turbulent perturbations from a precursor simulation onto the mean wind profile at the lateral boundaries. This new configuration facilitate the development of turbulence and resolves explicitly smaller scale motions without altering the mean flow. The spectral analysis of the Gaudex data highlights the fact that the turbulence on the lee side of the Gaudergrat ridge is influenced by local features, whereas at the crest, the effect of the surrounding mountains is recognisable. The statistical analysis of wind speed fluctuations shows that the turbulence in complex terrain is highly intermittent, but can be interpreted as a combination of subsets of isotropic turbulence. In complex terrain, the production of turbulence is not continuous, it is hence difficult to apply the traditional scaling and averaging laws developed for homogeneous horizontal surfaces. The heterogeneous surface conditions are likely to create additional length and time scale to generalise the statistical properties...|$|R

A number of additional dust suppression interventions were identified. These improvements, listed below, will assist in reducing dust concentrations around the drill rigs: • Increase maintenance frequency on the shroud, sealing ring, suction pipes and filters of the drill rigs, • Design and install new overlapping rubber belts on the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an air-blocking shelf on the inside perimeter of the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an <b>airflow</b> <b>meter</b> to ensure that the QC: QB ratio never drops below 3 : 1, • Only allow wet drilling, • Flush the dust collector system more regularly with compressed air to ensure that it does not become blocked, • Introduce stricter supervision to ensure that the suction pipes are always connected to the shroud, • Give drill rig operators more advanced training to ensure more effective drilling in order to reduce dust levels.

Finally, the engine was interfaced with a control system for pilot injection of DME. The engine testing is currently in progress. In addition, a one-pass process to form DME from natural gas was simulated with chemical processing software. Natural gas is reformed to synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), converted into methanol, and finally to DME in three steps. Of additional benefit to the internal combustion engine, the offgas from the pilot process can be mixed with the main natural gas charge {{and is expected to}} improve engine performance. Furthermore, a one-pass pilot facility was constructed to produce 3. 7 liters/hour (0. 98 gallons/hour) DME from methanol in order to characterize the effluent DME solution and determine suitability for engine use. Successful production of DME led to an economic estimate of completing a full natural gas-to-DME pilot process. Additional experimental work in constructing a synthesis gas to methanol reactor is in progress. The overall recommendation from this work is that natural gas to DME is not a suitable pathway to improved natural gas engine performance. The major reasons are difficulties in handling DME for pilot injection and the large capital costs associated with DME production from natural gas...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To i) {{investigate}} the stimulus {{characteristics of the}} Belmonte OPM pneumatic aesthesiometer in vitro and in vivo; ii) explore the relationship between corneal sensitivity threshold (CST), spontaneous eye blink rate (SEBR), ocular surface temperature (OST) and tear film quality, using the non-contact aesthesiometer (NCCA), and iii) {{investigate the}} relationship between heating and cooling of the ocular surface on CST (with the NCCA). Methods: Stimulus flow rate (<b>airflow</b> <b>meter),</b> air stimulus volume (air capture) and force (weight scales) were recorded in vitro. Stimulus temperature was measured in vitro (using thermocouples) and in vivo (via a thermal infrared camera). SEBR, CST, OST, NIBUT and lipid pattern of the tear film were recorded. CST (using NCCA), OST and tear film quality were obtained at baseline, and after increasing and decreasing OST, using heated goggles or cooling gel mask, respectively, until OST baseline level was reached again. OST was recorded during stimulus presentation at CST, immediately after heating and cooling of the ocular surface. Conclusions: Stimulus characteristics measured in vitro showed little variability and may therefore be considered as reliable. Stimulus temperature recorded in vivo showed that a change in stimulus flow rate produced a small, but statistically significant effect on OST. Consequently, this air stimulus may not be exclusively ‘mechanical’, and may provoke an additional response from temperature sensitive C fibres. A moderate correlation between corneal sensitivity and blink frequency was established, and {{a strong correlation between}} tear film quality, SEBR and OST was obtained, emphasising that ocular surface condition represents one important trigger for the initiation of a blink. After both an increase and a decrease of OST, a greater localised OST decrease was required at CST, indicating that heating or cooling of the ocular surface may affect the nervous activity / sensitivity of cold thermoreceptors in the superficial cornea...|$|E
40|$|The {{short-lived}} radon daughters (218 Po, 214 Pb, 214 Bi and 214 Po) {{are natural}} tracers in the troposphere, in particular near the ground surface. They are electrically charged particles and are chemically reactive. As {{soon as they}} are formed they get attached to the aerosol particles of the atmosphere. The behavior of radon daughters {{is similar to that}} of aerosols with respect to their growth, transport and removal processes in the atmosphere. The electrical conductivity of the atmosphere is mainly due to the presence of highly mobile ions. Galactic cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in the planetary boundary layer; however, near the surface of the earth, ions are produced mainly by decays of natural radioactive gases emanating from the soil surface and by radiations emitted directly from the surface. Hence the electrical conductivity of air near the surface of the earth is mainly due to radiations emitted by 222 Rn, 218 Po, 214 Pb, 214 Bi and 214 Po, and depends on aerosol concentrations and meteorological parameters. In the present work the diurnal and seasonal variations of radon and its progeny concentrations are studied using Low Level Radon Detection System and <b>Airflow</b> <b>Meter</b> respectively. Atmospheric electrical conductivity of both positive and negative polarities is measured using a Gerdien Condenser. All the measurements were carried out simultaneously at one location in Mysore city (12 °N, 76 °E), India. The diurnal variation of atmospheric electrical conductivity was found to be similar to that of ion pair production rate estimated from radon and its progeny concentrations with a maximum in the early morning hours and minimum during day time. The annual average concentrations of 222 Rn, 218 Po, 214 Pb, and 214 Po at the study location were found to be 21. 46, 10. 88, 1. 78 and 1. 80 Bq m− 3 respectively. The annual average values of positive and negative atmospheric electrical conductivity were found to be 18. 1 and 16. 6 f S m− 1 respectively. The radon and its progeny concentrations are higher in winter than in summer and rainy season...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} simple, practical, quantitative, and {{reliable}} field test method for measuring air leakage into enclosed cab filtration systems {{with the goal}} of making enclosed cabs a healthy and safe work environment. Background: Enclosed cabs are an engineering control that can provide a safe, comfortable, and healthy work environment for equipment operators. Most modern day enclosed cabs have heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems for maintaining a comfortable temperature and a breathable quantity of air for its occupants. Various levels of filtration can be incorporated into the HVAC system to improve the ventilation quality of the air inside the cab by removing outside airborne pollutants such as dusts, aerosols, and vapors. However, outside air leakage around the intake filter into the HVAC system can notably diminish the effectiveness of the cab's filtration system. A poorly sealed cab HVAC/filtration system can be difficult to recognize because of its concealed system components and the invisible nature of some airborne pollutants that can penetrate the cab. Researchers have previously measured airborne particulates in either ambient air or generated particulates inside a chamber surrounding the vehicle to quantify the particulate penetration into the enclosed cab. Several cab penetration studies have indicated that inconsistent and low particulate concentrations can yield unreliable cab performance results among replicated cab tests. Internal cab particulate generation such as dirty floors, interior surfaces, and abraded blower motor brushes can also interfere with measuring external particle penetration into the cab. Approach: A desirable air leakage test method would use a relatively constant airborne tracer gas level around a vehicle's cab which would pose minimal health and safety risks to the user. Atmospheric gases have these desirable attributes and were considered for the air leakage tracer gas. The technique involves replacing the HVAC intake particulate filter with a tracer gas filter, measuring tracer gas concentrations inside and outside the cab filtration system, and then applying a mathematical formula to calculate leakage. NIOSH partnered with the Clean Air Filter (CAF) Company of Defiance, Iowa under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop this air leakage test method for evaluating the environmental integrity of enclosed cabs. This research focused on developing a timely stationary vehicle cab leak test inside an unoccupied cab. Cab leakage testing research was ultimately conducted using the carbon dioxide (CO 2) in ambient air as the tracer gas given that CO 2 instrumentation and gas-absorbent media were readily available for filtration and methodology development. Figure 1 shows the typical CO 2 filter configurations constructed by CAF for leak testing enclosed cab filtration systems. Initial laboratory testing indicated that the CO 2 absorbent media bed thickness (T) needed to be greater than 2 inches (5. 1 cm) inside the filter for efficient CO 2 removal. Three different types of CO 2 instruments were also examined in the laboratory for their suitability for the proposed leak test. It was apparent that all the instrument types examined can drift and would need daily CO 2 gas calibrations to ensure their accuracy for a multiple-instrument cab test method. Because maintaining instrument accuracy during field testing can be challenging, a single-instrument cab testing methodology was developed to eliminate instrument bias errors and field calibration. This method measures relative CO 2 concentration differences inside and outside the cab filtration system using the same instrument at or near steady-state cab conditions. The equation shown below was developed to quantify air leakage around the CO 2 intake test filter by measuring CO 2 concentrations inside the cab, immediately after the intake filter, and outside the cab by using the same instrument. Air leakage is defined as the percentage of cab intake air that bypasses the filter media and is unfiltered. Laboratory tests were conducted with controlled air leakages of 0 %, 5. 5 %, and 11. 5 % into an unoccupied enclosed cab test stand. The leakage opening was downstream of two stacked block-style intake filters, which were 98 % effective for removing CO 2. A mass <b>airflow</b> <b>meter</b> was used to measure the quantity of air leakage into the filtration system, and a hot wire anemometer was used to measure the intake airflow into the cab. The CO 2 instruments were located outside the unoccupied cab enclosure and sequentially sampled the air inside the cab, immediately after the intake filter, and outside the cab through sampling hoses routed to these locations. A Sable CA- 10 a CO 2 instrument (Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV) used during the laboratory testing was an active sampling instrument with an internal air pump and was suitable for this type of cab sampling procedure. Several Vaisala GM 70 CO 2 instruments (Helsinki, Finland) used during the laboratory testing were passive handheld sampling instruments and had to be air aspirated by separate air sampling pumps to move the air from the various cab locations to the instrument's sensing chamber via calibration hood. The best cab leak test procedure devised in the laboratory was the measurement of the inside cab concentrations for 3 minutes after they stabilize from the filtration system startup. Then, after 2 minutes of stabilization time between the sampling location changes, the CO 2 concentrations were measured for 3 minutes at the other two sampling locations. This sampling procedure was sequentially repeated three times at all the sampling locations for each leakage condition. This procedure was replicated twice on two different days in the laboratory. Finally, this CO 2 leak test method was performed on a John Deere 7820 series tractor cab to demonstrate its application on an end-use vehicle cab. A round-style cartridge filter, as shown in Figure 1, was used for the test. Results: Laboratory test results showed that the CO 2 leak test method similarly quantified the cab leakage as compared to the directly measured airflow leakage into the filtration system. Figure 2 shows the measured CO 2 leakages as compared to the airflow leakage measurements into the cab enclosure. The unity line on the figure illustrates good correlation of the CO 2 leakage test method with the airflow measurements using the Sable and Vaisala instruments. Table 1 shows the data collected on the John Deere tractor cab for both the Sable and the Vaisala 1 instruments. The round-style CO 2 intake test filter provided better than 96 % removal efficiency. This table illustrates the consistent measurement biases between the two instruments at the various sampling locations. However, each instrument measured comparable air leakages because relative CO 2 concentration differences in the cab filtration system were used to calculate leakage. This test method provides cab manufacturers, cab service personnel, and industrial hygienists with a measurement tool to ensure environmental cab integrity and minimize worker exposure to outside airborne substances.
