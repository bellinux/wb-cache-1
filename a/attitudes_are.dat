5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E
25|$|In social psychology, <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} learned, global {{evaluations}} of a person, object, place, or issue that influence thought and action. Put more simply, <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> basic expressions of approval or disapproval, favorability or unfavorability, or as Bem put it, likes and dislikes. Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream, or endorsing {{the values of}} a particular political party.|$|E
25|$|<b>Attitudes</b> <b>are</b> also {{involved}} in several {{other areas of the}} discipline, such as conformity, interpersonal attraction, social perception, and prejudice.|$|E

25|$|This {{process has}} been studied {{extensively}} in social psychology as implicit associations and implicit attitudes, a component of implicit cognition. Implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience. Implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action towards social objects. These thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} the differing views of Catholics and certain Protestants on concupiscence is their {{position}} on sin in general. Certain Protestants (for instance the magisterial reformers) hold that one can be guilty of sin {{even if it is}} not voluntary; The Catholic Church, by contrast, traditionally has held that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The Scholastics and magisterial reformers have different views on the issue of what is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered the emotions of love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of will or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> acts of will, sinful <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. Since human nature (and therefore concupiscence) is not voluntarily chosen, the Catholic Church does not teach that it is sinful; some Protestants believe that, since some sins are involuntary, it can be.|$|E

50|$|Free drift mode {{refers to}} a state of motion engaged by an object in orbit, whereby {{constant}} <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> not maintained. When <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> not maintained, the object is said to be in free drift, thereby relying on its own inertia to avoid attitude drift.|$|R

25|$|Social {{psychologists have}} studied {{attitude}} formation, {{the structure of}} attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, {{and the relationship between}} attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.|$|E
25|$|Each Singaporean's {{behaviours}} and <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> influenced by, {{among other}} things, {{his or her}} home language and his religion. Singaporeans who speak English as their native language tend to lean toward Western culture, while those who speak Chinese as their native language tend to lean toward Chinese culture and Confucianism. Malay-speaking Singaporeans tend to lean toward Malay culture, which itself is closely linked to Islamic culture.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Attitude</b> <b>is</b> one of Jung's 57 {{definitions}} in Chapter XI of Psychological Types.

Within this broad definition Jung defines several attitudes.|$|R
25|$|As the {{influence}} of foreign and domestic cultures (especially from more cosmopolitan areas like Mexico City) grows throughout Mexico, <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> changing. This is most marked in the largest metropolitan areas, such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Tijuana, where education and access to foreigners and foreign news media are greatest. Change is slower in the hinterlands, however, and even in large cities discomfort with change often leads to backlashes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to Wesleyan University professor Abdelmajid Hannoum, {{the view that}} Arab scholars and geographers from this time period held racist <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> the result of mistranslations, stating that such attitudes were not prevalent until the 18th and 19th centuries. He argues that the mistranslations {{are the result of}} French Orientalists projecting racist and colonialist views of the 19th century into their translations of medieval Arabic writings. James E. Lindsay also argues that the concept of an Arab identity itself did not exist until modern times.|$|E
25|$|The book {{argues that}} {{intuitive}} judgment is developed by experience, training, and knowledge. For example, Gladwell claims that prejudice can operate at an intuitive unconscious level, even in individuals whose conscious <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> not prejudiced. An example {{is in the}} halo effect, where a person having a salient positive quality {{is thought to be}} superior in other, unrelated respects. Gladwell uses the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo, where four New York policemen shot an innocent man on his doorstep 41 times, as another example of how rapid, intuitive judgment can have disastrous effects.|$|E
40|$|Abortion <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> studies {{within a}} {{framework}} of feminist object relations theory. 80 subjects from a small coeducational college participated. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>were</b> assessed by a questionnaire containing: background information, Bem sex role inventory, Kalin sex role ideology measure, an abortion attitude inventory, and an adapted form of the Thematic Apperception Tests. There was a link between sex and abortion attitude, traditional ideology, and verbal TAT response.

25|$|On {{this point}} of view, paraphilias {{represent}} such as sexual behaviors due to a high impulsivity-compulsivity drive. It is difficult to distinguish impulsivity from compulsivity: sometimes paraphilic behaviors are prone to achieve pleasure (desire or fantasy), in some other cases these <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> merely expressions of anxiety, and the behavioral perversion {{is an attempt to}} reduce anxiety. In the last case, the pleasure gained is short in time and is followed by a new increase in anxiety levels, such as it can be seen in an obsessive patient after he performs his compulsion.|$|E
25|$|Though gender {{discrimination}} and sexism refer to beliefs and attitudes {{in relation to}} the gender of a person, such beliefs and <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. Sex discrimination, on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of prejudice and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{students}} from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan live separately {{in their own}} dorms, as do foreigners. Mainlanders who are fluent in English or any foreign language may live in the foreigner- Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan dorms, assuming they will be a roommate {{and participate in the}} foreign student activities, in order to help people get accustomed to mainland Chinese life. The quality of these dorms is usually better than that of mainland student dorms, with rooms either shared between only two people or completely private for a single student. Sexual decency <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> laxer than in mainlander dorms, with males and females sharing the same buildings and sometimes hallways (though not rooms). Students are allowed to bring visitors—including mainlanders—of the opposite sex to their rooms. Guests {{may or may not be}} allowed to stay overnight, depending on the rules of the dorm. Electricity is usually available at all hours of the day.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of whether or not [...] "acting white" [...] <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> prevalent has been debated in academic literature. The African-American comedian and media figure, Bill Cosby, used the term in what became a noted May 2004 speech when he challenged the black community against the idea that gaining education was [...] "acting white". Black people accused of [...] "acting white" [...] are sometimes referred to as Black Anglo-Saxons, a term coined by comedian Paul Mooney. The 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States resulted in a public discussion that the acting white attitude may be waning, as he represented a model of African-American achievement.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{reveals that}} the relationship between celebrity attitude and attitude toward brands paired with the celebrity's voice is moderated by identification of the celebrity but only when <b>attitude</b> <b>is</b> measured explicitly. Using explicit measures, celebrity <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> positively (negatively) related to brand attitude change when the evaluator could not (could) identify the celebrity. This finding is attributed to "resetting," a correction of the perceived influence from irrelevant cues. On implicit measures, a positive relationship between celebrity and brand <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> observed regardless of celebrity identification. The disassociation between the explicit and implicit results suggests that resetting requires explicit evaluation. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
