40|$|Objective - The hydatid cyst of the liver; an anthropozoonosis {{due to a}} cestode (Echinococcus granulosus), {{the usual}} host {{of which is the}} dog, is not common in Western Europe, but has been {{diagnosed}} in patients coming from Southern Europe and Northern Africa. This retrospective study describes the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of the hydatid echinococcosis. Material and methods - We examined the evolution of 97 consecutive patients admitted and treated surgically fora hydatid cyst in 1998 in a Central Tunisia university hospital. Results - The patients' mean age was 41 +/- 19. 8 years (range: 4 and 85). The most common cause for consulting a physician was pain (79. 4 %), usually located in the right upper quadrant Sometimes, the disease occurred with the onset of serious complications. In some cases it was also discovered fortuitously. The most sensitive diagnostic method was <b>abdominal</b> <b>echotomography,</b> positive in every case. Serology and TD scan were also performed in some cases. The treatment was surgery with two methods: a radical and a conservative one; 16. 5 % of postoperative complications are reported for both techniques (fistula and surinfection). Conclusion - The hydatid disease of the liver is a histologically benign pathology, but it may become dangerous because of possible serious complications. Although there are efficacious therapeutic weapons, prevention and education of the population living in endemic zones is strongly advised.

40|$|Abdominal {{tuberculosis}} {{is quite}} {{commonly found in}} miliary tuberculosis, especially in countries where TB is endemic, however the abdominal localization of tuberculosis in absence of disseminated disease is a rare condition and {{the involvement of the}} pancreas alone is extremely rare. Epidemiology of TB is changing in the latest years, often this illness is found in non-endemic regions and physicians are asked to interpret what happen when an old disease meets new diagnostic technologies. We describe the case of a young male admitted in our hospital for <b>abdominal</b> pain. <b>Echotomography,</b> CT scan and MRI showed a pancreatic mass suspected to be cancer and susceptible to surgical treatment, Endoscopic Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) showed isolated pancreatic tuberculosis...|$|R
