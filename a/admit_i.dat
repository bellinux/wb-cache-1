500|$|Halperin {{concludes that}} the Scientology {{organization}} is more focused on money than on other issues: [...] "I pretty much found that everything about the church is about making {{as much money as}} possible, which doesn't really make them much different from most other religions. I have to be honest and <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> also met some nice people in the church. It's just that I have a huge problem with their discriminatory attitude toward gays." [...] Halperin disputes Andrew Morton's claim in his book [...] that actor Tom Cruise is second in command of the organization, instead asserting Cruise is actually in the top position of leadership.|$|E
500|$|Reception of Marvel Trading Card Game {{across all}} three {{platforms}} was mixed. [...] The game {{was compared to}} other collectible card games such as Pokémon, Magic, and Munchkin. [...] Reviewers were pleased with the game's representation of the VS System rules, but {{felt that it was}} less accessible to players who weren't familiar with the physical version. [...] Several reviews referred to the gameplay as addictive; IGN's Hilary Goldstein said [...] "I have to <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> am somewhat addicted to the Marvel Trading Card Game. It's not a great game by any measure, but it does an excellent job of tapping into the collector's mentality of comic-book fans." ...|$|E

500|$|Only {{two songs}} [...] "Vacant" [...] and [...] "Potions", {{have ever been}} {{identified}} as Tapeworm songs. Neither have been released, though cover versions by Maynard James Keenan's other projects have surfaced. The first, [...] "Vacant" [...] was initially conceived during the Tapeworm sessions; the track being written by Lohner and re-arranged by Clouser, with lyrics and melody by Keenan and chorus and backing vocals by Reznor. The song was first performed live by A Perfect Circle throughout their 2001 tour. MTV reported that Reznor was apparently not happy that Keenan performed the song: [...] "I have to <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> find it mildly irritating for [...] "Vacant" [...] to debut in this fashion before feeling it has been properly realized," [...] Shortly after {{the dissolution of the}} Tapeworm project, Keenan released a reworked version on A Perfect Circle's 2004 cover album Emotive under the title [...] "Passive".|$|E
500|$|After Sigappu Rojakkal, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of the thriller genre in Tamil cinema, as evidenced by films like Moodu Pani. According to film producer and writer G. Dhananjayan, the film [...] "inspired a generation to take up film-making". M. Suganth of The Times of India stated that Mahendra [...] "changed the landscape of Tamil cinema with his distinctive visuals and eclectic films" [...] such as Moodu Pani. Pothen recalled in January 2015 {{that it was the}} simultaneous release of Moodu Pani and his other film Varumayin Niram Sivappu that made him a star. However, both Varumayin Niram Sivappu, which depicted Pothen as an eccentric director obsessed with an actress, and Moodu Pani led to him being typecast in similar roles. [...] "Both roles caught the public imagination, and I <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> cashed in when I was offered similar stuff. Now, unless I'm offered an unreasonable amount of money, I doubt I'll accept these roles," [...] he said in a 2014 interview.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} divided {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 7.9/10, saying, [...] "Overall, while it's {{far from being}} the funniest episode of the season, there were more than enough laughs and uncomfortable moments to make this episode entertaining." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the episode could have been more though, due to the fact that the show has used many clever gay jokes in the past. Likewise, Alex Rocha of TV Guide commented, [...] "'Family Gay' fell way short of my expectations. Even with its traditional pop culture references and flashbacks, this week's episode could not simply keep me tuned in. I'll <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> did manage to laugh at times, but as in previous times, Family Guy simply fell short again." [...] Steve Heisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "yet another pointless exercise in Family Guy insider smugness", and rating it C-.|$|E
500|$|Patti Smith {{had a great}} {{influence}} on Iyall. [...] " [...] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet," [...] she said. [...] "She combined things I was interested in. Plus, she wasn't a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That appealed to me. It looked like something I could do. You didn't have to look {{like all the other}} singers." [...] Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. [...] "I hate rock and roll right now. It's turned into some new kind of stupid [...] religion... I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. [...] Actually, I'll <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> like The Bangles – they have a great sound. But I'd just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music. I love language – plain speech, used in an enigmatic, subliminal way; I'm not [...] much tied to the literal." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us {{one last look at}} this quirky group of people in their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have to <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E

500|$|Patrick Mulkern, {{writing for}} the Radio Times, echoed Fuller's sentiments in his review, saying [...] "I must <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> yawn at aliens {{disguised}} as humans. We've seen {{it so many times}} now" [...] and noted that Whithouse had used the concept in [...] "School Reunion" [...] and his Torchwood episode [...] "Greeks Bearing Gifts". However, he also thought that [...] "the script delivers lots of heroics and funny moments for the Doctor, Amy and Rory", and he praised the [...] "terrific cast", describing Helen McCrory as [...] "majestic". IGN's Matt Wales rated [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] 7 out of 10, saying that it [...] "had plenty of standout moments, even if it didn't quite manage to come together to form a completely satisfying whole". He praised the comedy between Amy and Rory and McCrory's acting, as well as the location shots and Croatia and thought [...] "the sci-fi retcon of classic vampire phenomenon was particularly clever", believing that the aliens went beyond two-dimensional. However, he agreed with Fuller and Mulkern that [...] "its single biggest problem was one of over-familiarity", with many misplaced alien races having featured before.|$|E

2500|$|At 5 feet, 11inches, and 185 pounds, Doll {{was small}} for a {{professional}} football player. [...] In a 1954 profile on Doll, a reporter noted, [...] "Don, who's built like a bank clerk, piano tuner, soda jerk, errand boy or -- egad -- even a sports writer doesn't look any more like a pro gridder than your cousin Joe." [...] Doll explained how he handled the disparity in size with the players he was required to tackle: [...] "I just throw a shoulder into 'em and hit 'em low. [...] If they are over two tons I aim for their shoelaces. [...] If they're medium sized (around boxcar weight) I hit for the thighs. [...] I'll <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> do not drive 'em back but I stop 'em where they are. ... My size is no detriment in football. [...] I rate as the No. 1 asset the 'desire' to tackle. [...] And I've plenty of that desire." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} adaptations, Flitwick is portrayed by Warwick Davis. Rowling said: [...] "I must <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> {{was taken aback}} when I saw the film Flitwick, who {{looks very much like}} a goblin/elf (I’ve never {{actually}} asked the film-makers precisely what he is), because the Flitwick in my imagination simply looks like a very small old man." [...] However, Rowling mentions on her official website that Flitwick is human, with [...] "a dash of goblin ancestry." [...] His on-screen appearance changes noticeably in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in which he takes on a more human and less elf-like look, with slicked-down dark hair and moustache. According to Davis, the moustachioed character was originally not supposed to be Flitwick; Flitwick was absent from the script for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but [...] "the producer" [...] (presumably David Heyman) added the new character (as the conductor of the school choir and orchestra, credited as [...] "Choir Master") so that Davis could still appear in the film. Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell preferred the new look, [...] "and from that moment, the character became known as 'Flitwick'." ...|$|E
