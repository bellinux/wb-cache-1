25|$|A {{few other}} rare hybrids {{resemble}} A.×ebenoides. A.×hendersonii, once suggested {{to be the}} same species, has longer sori, more obtuse pinnae, and a scaly stipe. The unnamed triploid backcross of A.×ebenoides with A.rhizophyllum was accidentally generated in culture in 1956, and subsequently identified with a fern collected in West Virginia in 1946, previously identified as an aberrant A.×ebenoides. This hybrid is intermediate between its parents, bearing lobes in the basal part of the frond only, and with purple color extending up the rachis but not the stipe. A.×crucibuli, an <b>artificial</b> <b>hybrid</b> between A.platyneuron and the Asian walking fern, A.ruprechtii, has narrower blades, deeply pinnatifid in the middle and becoming pinnate at the base.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, he made {{chromosome}} {{counts of}} A.×trudellii, {{which had been}} classified by some simply as a variety of A.pinnatifidum. As A.pinnatifidum {{proved to be a}} tetraploid while A.montanum was a diploid, a hybrid between them would be a triploid, and Wagner showed that this was in fact the case for A.×trudellii. His further experiments, published the following year, strongly suggested that A.pinnatifidum is an allotetraploid, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and A.rhizophyllum to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility. However, the hypothesized sterile diploid has never been found. Partial pairing of homologous chromosomes in A.×gravesii and A.×trudellii confirmed A.montanum parentage for A.pinnatifidum, while an <b>artificial</b> <b>hybrid</b> between A.pinnatifidum and Tutwiler's spleenwort (A.tutwilerae) helped confirm their shared A.rhizophyllum parentage.|$|E
2500|$|The herpetologist Laurence Monroe Klauber proposed, in a tongue-in-cheek article which blames Dr. Watson {{for getting}} {{the name of the}} snake wrong, a theory that the swamp adder was an <b>artificial</b> <b>hybrid</b> between the Mexican Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Naja naja. His {{speculation}} suggests that Doyle might have hidden a double-meaning in Holmes' words. What Holmes said, reported by Watson, was [...] "It is a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India"; but Klauber suggested what Holmes really said was [...] "It is a samp-aderm, the deadliest skink in India." [...] Samp-aderm can be translated [...] "snake-Gila-monster": Samp is Hindi for snake, and the suffix aderm is derived from heloderm, the common or vernacular name of the Gila monster generally used by European naturalists. Skinks are lizards of the family Scincidae, many of which are snake-like in form. Such a hybrid reptile will have a venom incomparably strengthened by hybridization, assuring the almost instant demise of the victim. And it will also have ears like any lizard, so it could hear the whistle, and legs and claws allowing it to run up and down the bell cord with a swift ease.|$|E

40|$|Habitats {{that differ}} in soil {{resource}} availability {{are expected to}} differ for selection on resource-related plant traits. • Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation in phenotypic selection on leaf ecophysiological traits for 10 Helianthus populations, including two species of hybrid origin, Helianthus anomalus and Helianthus deserticola, and <b>artificial</b> <b>hybrids</b> of their ancestral parents. Leaf traits assessed were leaf size, succulence, nitrogen (N) concentration and water-use efficiency (WUE). • Biomass and leaf traits of <b>artificial</b> <b>hybrids</b> indicate that the actively moving dune habitat of H. anomalus was more growth limiting, with lower N availability but higher relative water availability than the stabilized dune habitat of H. deserticola. Habitats differed for direct selection on leaf N and WUE, but not size or succulence, for the <b>artificial</b> <b>hybrids.</b> However, within the H. anomalus habitat, direct selection on WUE also differed among populations. Across years, direct selection on leaf traits did not differ. • Leaf N was the only trait for which direct selection differed between habitats but not within the H. anomalus habitat, suggesting that nutrient limitation is an important selective force driving adaptation of H. anomalus to the active dune habitat.
