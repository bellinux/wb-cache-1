40|$|Mid-infrared (8 - 13 microns) {{spectra of}} {{radiation}} emitted {{from the surface}} of solar system objects can be interpreted in terms of surface composition. However, the spectral features are weak, and require exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio spectra to detect them. Ground-based observations of spectra in this region are plagued by strong <b>atmospheric</b> <b>absorptions</b> from water and ozone. High-altitude balloon measurements that avoid <b>atmospheric</b> <b>absorptions</b> can be affected by contamination of the optics by dust. We have developed a technique to obtain mid-infrared spectra of Mercury that minimizes these problems. The resulting spectra show evidence of transparency features {{that can be used to}} qualitatively characterize the surface composition.

25|$|The {{microphone}} design {{differs from}} that of a conventional audio system in that the peculiar features of infrasound are taken into account. First, infrasound propagates over vast distances through the Earth's atmosphere as a result of very low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> and of refractive ducting that enables propagation by way of multiple bounces between the Earth's surface and the stratosphere. A second property that has received little attention is the great penetration capability of infrasound through solid matter – a property utilized in the design and fabrication of the system windscreens.|$|E

Historically, photographic plates were widely used to record spectra until electronic detectors were developed, and today optical spectrographs most often employ charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The wavelength scale of a spectrum can be calibrated by observing {{the spectrum of}} emission lines of known wavelength from a gas-discharge lamp. The flux scale of a spectrum can be calibrated {{as a function of}} wavelength by comparison with an observation of a standard star with corrections for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> of light; this is known as spectrophotometry.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{material}} launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which {{raises the possibility that}} high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion. Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at 2.45GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased <b>atmospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse, {{it is not possible to}} make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.|$|E

2500|$|Helioseismology is {{the process}} of {{inferring}} the internal structure and kinematics of the Sun from the propagation of seismic waves, particularly acoustic waves (p waves) and surface gravity waves (f waves). It was developed by analogy to geoseismology (originally called simply seismology), and subsequently there emerged asteroseismology, in which seismic waves are analysed to constrain the internal structures of other stars. Because the Sun is fluid, to a first approximation it cannot support shear waves (s-waves), unlike the seismic waves on Earth. An exception is the magneto-acoustic waves which appear to be important only in the atmosphere. The helioseismic waves are generated by the turbulence in the convection zone immediately beneath the Sun's surface. Certain frequencies are amplified by constructive interference, leading to resonance. In other words, the turbulence [...] "rings" [...] the sun like a bell. The resonant waves are reflected near the photosphere, the visible surface of the sun, where they can be observed. The oscillations are detectable in almost any time series of solar images, but are best observed by measuring the Doppler shift of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> lines. Details of the propagation of the seismic waves through the Sun, inferred from the resonant frequencies, reveal the Sun's inner structure, allowing astrophysicists to develop an extremely detailed representation of the hydrostatic stratification and the internal angular velocity. That has permitted the evaluation of the quadrupole moment, , and higher-order moments [...] of the Sun's external gravitational potential. It is a more accurate and more robust procedure than trying to infer it from the oblateness of the visible disc. Together with measurements of the orbits of Mercury and of spacecraft, the result is consistent with General Relativity.|$|E

The 1986 data was at 3 % spectral resolution with a spatial spot diameter of 2000 km and covered a wavelength region between 2. 5 µm and 4. 2 µm. The 3 µm bound water band was clearly observed and an upper limit of 3 - 5 wt% carbonate was established for the regions measured based on comparisons with laboratory mixtures of carbonates and Mauna Kea palagonite, a Martian soil analog. The 1988 data had 1 / 3 % spectral resolution between 3. 2 µm and 5. 1 µm with a 900 km spatial resolution.
