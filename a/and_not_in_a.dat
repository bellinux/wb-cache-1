5|$|The Cleveland area showered {{support on}} the Browns from the outset. Meanwhile, the Browns {{unexpectedly}} had Cleveland to themselves; the NFL's Cleveland Rams, who had continually lost money despite winning the 1945 NFL championship, moved to Los Angeles after that season. The Browns' on-field feats only amplified their popularity, and the team saw average attendance of 57,000 per game in its first season. The Browns, however, became victims of their own success. Cleveland's dominance exposed a lack of balance among AAFC teams, which the league tried to correct by sending Browns players including quarterback Y. A. Tittle to the Baltimore Colts in 1948. Attendance at Browns games fell in later years as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, while attendance for less successful teams fell even more precipitously. The Browns led all of football during the undefeated season in 1948 with an average crowd of 45,517, but {{that was more than}} 10,000 less than the average per game the previous year. These factors – combined with a war for players between the two leagues that raised salaries and ate into owners' profits – ultimately led to the dissolution of the AAFC and the merger of three of its teams, including the Browns, into the NFL in 1949. The NFL does not acknowledge AAFC statistics and records because these achievements – including the Browns' perfect season – did not take place in the NFL or against NFL teams, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> league fully absorbed by the NFL.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E

25|$|To {{protect itself}} from an {{increasingly}} aggressive Nazi Germany, already {{responsible for the}} annexations of Austria (in the Anschluss of 1938), Czechoslovakia (in 1939) {{and a part of}} Lithuania after the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania, Poland entered into a military alliance with Britain and France (the 1939 Anglo-Polish military alliance and the earlier Franco-Polish military alliance of 1921, as updated in 1939). However, the two Western powers were defense-oriented <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strong position, either geographically or in terms of resources, to assist Poland. Attempts were therefore made by them to induce Soviet-Polish cooperation, which they viewed as the only militarily viable possibility.|$|E
25|$|Membership {{data on a}} {{relatively}} new, worldwide religion are difficult to arrive at.

Populations are not assigned a Bahá'í religious adherence by birth, {{as is the case}} with other major religions such as Islam and Christianity. Few religious surveys include the Bahá'í Faith due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error, and those that have included the Bahá'í Faith are known to underestimate or overinflate many proportionally small groups. Additionally, Bahá'í membership data does not break out active participation from the total number of people who have expressed their belief.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on April 28, Price sent Samuel Maxey's {{division}} of two cavalry brigades back to Oklahoma and Texas {{to attend to}} reported threats to that territory by another federal force. Brigadier-General Fagan, who had commanded the victorious Confederate forces at Marks Mill, took off on independent operations but did not fulfill his orders which permitted this movement along with some stated objectives. He failed in his first objective to destroy the Federal supply depot at Pine Bluff, probably {{because he could not}} cross the swollen Saline River, a tributary of the Ouachita River. Fagan also failed to occupy a position across Steele's supply and communication lines between Camden and Little Rock, as Price had ordered. Fagan probably was looking for food and forage for his own force. Fagan was not in immediate communication with Price <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to know about Steele's recent movements out of Camden, but Price realized on April 29 that Fagan was not blocking the federal retreat.

William's followers expected and received lands and titles in return for their service in the invasion, but William claimed ultimate possession of the land in England over which his armies had given him de facto control, and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit. Henceforth, all land was [...] "held" [...] directly from the king in feudal tenure in return for military service.
