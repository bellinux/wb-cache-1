5|$|The Kingdom of This World {{has a deep}} {{focus on}} the nature of revolution, and the novel itself {{can be viewed as a}} {{reflection}} of Carpentier's ideological perspective towards revolutions. Carpentier tries to establish the idea that a distinction must be made between revolutions <b>and</b> <b>reactions.</b> While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E
5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing <b>and</b> <b>reactions</b> to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E
5|$|Featuring {{a number}} of erudite characters, The Elegance of the Hedgehog is full of allusions to {{literary}} works, music, films, and paintings. It incorporates themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. The events and ideas of the novel are presented through the thoughts <b>and</b> <b>reactions,</b> interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, the narration {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and in the present tense.|$|E

40|$|The {{ignition}} <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> {{mechanisms of}} the thermal explosion {{reaction in the}} Ni-Ti-C system under air and Ar conditions were investigated. The reaction {{for the formation of}} TiC can be initiated at a low temperature under air. The ignition temperature under air is much lower than that under Ar. Under Ar, both the ignition <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> mechanisms consist of dissolution, <b>reaction,</b> <b>and</b> precipitation. Under air, the ignition mechanism is confirmed to be the chemical oven mechanism, <b>and</b> the <b>reaction</b> mechanism is dissolution, <b>reaction,</b> <b>and</b> precipitation. The mechanism of gas transport plays a much more minor role in the ignition <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> processes under air...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{diffusion}} <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> {{rates are}} two general kinetic factors {{involved in the}} formation of materials. They {{play an important role in}} the structure development of materials. In most cases, chemical diffusion <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> are coupled each other, which makes it difficult to differentiate their effects in shaping materials. Here we propose to quantify diffusion <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> by the Damkohler number (Da) and to elucidate their roles in shaping particles. Silver particles are synthesized by electrodeposition approach at different <b>reaction</b> <b>and</b> diffusion conditions. Both diffusion efficiency <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> rate constants are quantified, and the Damkohler number is calculated. If chemical diffusion or reaction is the rate-determining step {{in the formation of}} materials, simple structures, such as polyhedrons and irregular particles, are usually formed. When the interplay of diffusion <b>and</b> <b>reaction</b> dominates the structure development, complex structures, such as dendrites, are generated. The formation of each structure is closely related to Da values. On the basis of this finding, three growth modes of particles are put forward and evaluated by the following studies...|$|R
5|$|Several other {{candidates}} publicly announced {{their intention to}} run for the office. Jože Andrejaš, Jožef Horvat, Matej Sedmak, Marjan Beranič, Marko Kožar and Pavel Premrl failed to gather sufficient public support or later decided to withdraw from the race. Artur Štern, after leading a spoof campaign, announced that he was in fact performing a hidden camera experiment. The footage was used by Franci Kek and Vojko Anzeljc in a film Gola resnica, airing in early 2009 and addressing objectivity of media, problems with election legislation <b>and</b> <b>reactions</b> from Slovenes.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms <b>and</b> <b>reactions</b> across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls <b>and</b> <b>reactions</b> to specific types of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E
