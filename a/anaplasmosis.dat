5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis,</b> Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and <b>anaplasmosis.</b> They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and <b>anaplasmosis.</b> During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine <b>anaplasmosis</b> and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E
25|$|Ticks that {{transmit}} B. burgdorferi {{to humans}} can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as Theileria microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis</b> (HGA), respectively. Among early Lyme disease patients, {{depending on their}} location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–40% will have babesiosis. Ticks in certain regions, including the lands along the eastern Baltic Sea, also transmit tick-borne encephalitis.|$|E
25|$|Bites of tabanid flies are painful. Dense {{populations of}} these flies cause severe biting stress to {{livestock}} and horses leading to reduction of gain in liveweight. These hosts may additionally suffer loss of grazing time by clustering in tight defensive packs, a situation known as fly-syndrome. Many genera of tabanid flies transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma evansi that causes in camels and horses the disease called surra. These flies also transmit the protozoan T.vivax that causes in cattle the disease called nagana. Tabanid flies are also transmitters the bacteria Anaplasma marginale and A.centrale to cattle, sheep and goats, causing <b>anaplasmosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Pound was {{commissioned}} by the Government in 1894 to investigate redwater cattle disease in the Gulf Country of Northern Australia.

50|$|Vaccines against <b>anaplasmosis</b> are available. Carrier animals {{should be}} {{eliminated}} from flocks. Tick control {{may also be}} useful although {{it can be difficult}} to implement.|$|E
50|$|Amblyomma is a genus of hard ticks. Some are disease vectors, {{for example}} for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Brazil or {{ehrlichiosis}} and <b>anaplasmosis</b> in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{there is}} no vaccine against human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis,</b> so {{antibiotics}} are the only form of treatment. [...] The best way to prevent HGA is to prevent getting tick bites.|$|E
50|$|Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a Gram-negative, obligate {{bacterium}} of neutrophils. It causes human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis,</b> {{which is}} a tick-borne rickettsial disease. Because this bacterium invades neutrophils, it has a unique adaptation and pathogenetic mechanism.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, bovine <b>anaplasmosis,</b> {{caused by}} Anaplasma marginale, is only {{found in the}} {{northern}} and eastern parts of Australia where the cattle tick is present. It was probably introduced as early as 1829 by cattle from Indonesia infested with the cattle tick Boophilus microplus.|$|E
50|$|Human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis</b> (HGA) is a tick-borne, {{infectious}} disease caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an obligate intracellular bacterium that is typically transmitted to humans by ticks of the Ixodes ricinus species complex, including Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus in North America. These ticks also transmit Lyme disease and other tick borne diseases.|$|E
5000|$|Ticks (Ixodidae): Babesia canis {{subspecies}} (Babesia canis canis, B. canis vogeli, B. canis rossi, and B. canis gibsoni cause babesiosis. Ehrlichia canis and E. chaffeensis cause monocytic ehrlichiosis. Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis.</b> Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. Rickettsia rickettsii causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsia conorii causes Mediterranean spotted fever.|$|E

Dermacentor ticks inject a neurotoxin that causes tick paralysis.|$|E
50|$|The Queensland Government engaged Dodd in 1907 as Principal Veterinary Surgeon and Bacteriologist, {{following}} a cattle tick conference in May of that year. Instructed by the Queensland Government, Dodd visited North America on-route to Australia to investigate bovine tick fever in the United States and Canada (also known as redwater or Texas fever: see babesiosis, <b>anaplasmosis).</b>|$|E
50|$|Many Rhipicephalus are of economic, medical, and {{veterinary}} importance {{because they}} are vectors of pathogens. They transmit the pathogens that cause the animal and human diseases East Coast fever, <b>anaplasmosis,</b> babesiosis, rickettsiosis, Boutonneuse fever, Lyme disease, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and they inject a neurotoxin in their bite that leads to tick-caused paralysis.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis is {{currently}} through {{the elimination of}} other causes of infectious diseases with related symptoms like ehrlichiosis and <b>anaplasmosis</b> or if the patient fails to respond to treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline. RT-PCR may then be used to detect viral ssRNA in the blood. Antibody titers against the virus may {{also be used to}} indicate infection with the Heartland virus.|$|E

5000|$|Doxycycline is the {{treatment}} of choice. If <b>anaplasmosis</b> is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive laboratory confirmation, as prompt doxycycline therapy {{has been shown to}} improve outcomes. Presentation during early pregnancy can complicate treatment. Doxycycline compromises dental enamel during development. Although rifampin is indicated for post-delivery pediatric and some doxycycline-allergic patients, it is teratogenic. Rifampin is contraindicated during conception and pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Ticks that {{transmit}} B. burgdorferi {{to humans}} can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as Theileria microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis</b> (HGA), respectively.

5000|$|Based on {{the time}} {{interval}} for other tick-borne diseases like Lyme disease and <b>anaplasmosis,</b> the time interval for transmission of POWV {{is expected to be}} less than 12 hours. Once the POWV reaches humans it cannot be transmitted to a feeding tick, therefore humans are considered [...] "dead-end" [...] hosts. , the fastest transmission time of DTV from a Ix. scapularis nymph to a mouse was no more than 15 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Ixodes is a genus of hard-bodied ticks (family Ixodidae). It {{includes}} important disease vectors {{of animals}} and humans (tick-borne disease), and some species (notably Ixodes holocyclus) inject toxins that can cause paralysis. Some ticks in this genus may transmit the pathogenic bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi responsible for causing Lyme disease. Additional organisms that may be transmitted by Ixodes are parasites from the genus Babesia which cause babesiosis, and bacteria from the related genera Anaplasma which cause <b>anaplasmosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Patients {{suffering}} from human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis</b> (HGA) undergo doxycycline therapy, 100 mg twice daily until the patient’s fever subsides {{for at least}} three days. This drug has been the most beneficial to these patients infected with the bacteria. Some other tetracycline drugs are also effective. In general, patients with symptoms of HGA and unexplained fever after a tick exposure should receive empiric doxycycline therapy while their diagnostic tests are pending, especially if they experience leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{outbreak}} of Human Granulocytic <b>Anaplasmosis</b> (HGA) in the United States {{was in a}} patient in early 1990 in Wisconsin. He was kept in the hospital in Minnesota for testing, but died without a diagnosis. [...] Over {{the next couple of}} years, many people within the same area of Wisconsin and Minnesota had come down with the same symptoms. It was discovered in 1994 that it was Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE), later to be known as HGA.|$|E
50|$|I. persulcatus ticks {{transmit}} Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Siberian (TBEV-Sib) and Far Eastern (TBEV-FE) tick-borne encephalitis, {{and probably}} human granulocytic <b>anaplasmosis</b> as well. A {{recent study of}} the northernmost tick-borne encephalitis focus in Simo, Finnish Lapland, found I. persulcatus ticks in scattered foci along the western coast, including the Kokkola archipelago and Närpes municipality, demonstrating a northward movement of foci and an unusual combination of the TBEV-Eur strain and I. persulcatus ticks in an area with no evidence of cocirculation of tick species or TBEV subtypes.|$|E
