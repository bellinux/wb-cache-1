The three biochemical tests most widely used are the <b>activation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the erythrocyte enzyme aspartate aminotransferase, plasma PLP concentrations, and the urinary excretion of vitamin B6 degradation products, specifically urinary PA. Of these, plasma PLP {{is probably the best}} single measure, because it reflects tissue stores. Plasma PLP less than 10 nmol/l is indicative of vitamin B6 deficiency. A PLP concentration greater than 20 nmol/l has been chosen as a level of adequacy for establishing Estimated Average Requirements and Recommended Daily Allowances in the USA. Urinary PA is also an indicator of vitamin B6 deficiency; levels of less than 3.0 mmol/day is suggestive of vitamin B6 deficiency.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the problem}} of convolutive source {{separation}} via multimodal soft Nonnegative Matrix Co-Factorization (NMCF) is addressed. Different aspects of a phenomenon may be recorded by sensors of different types (e. g., audio and video of human speech), and each of these recorded signals is called a modality. Since the underlying phenomenon of the modalities is the same, they have some similarities. Especially, they usually have similar time changes.

Assuming this similarity, it is expected that the <b>activation</b> <b>coefficient</b> matrices of their Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) have a similar form. In this paper, the similarity of the <b>activation</b> <b>coefficient</b> matrices between the modalities is considered for co-factorization.

40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of adult {{disability}} with upper-limb hemiparesis being one of the most frequent consequences. Given that stroke only affects the paretic arm’s control structure (the set of synergies and activation vectors needed to perform a movement), we propose that the control structure of the non-affected arm can serve as a physiological reference to rehabilitate the paretic arm. However, it is unclear how rehabilitation can effectively tune the control structure of a patient. The use of Visual Feedback (VF) is recommended to boost stroke rehabilitation, as it is able to positively modify neural mechanisms and improve motor performance. Thus, in this study we investigate whether VF can effectively modify the control structure of the upper-limb. We asked six neurologically intact subjects to perform a complete upper-limb rehabilitation routine comprised of 12 movements in absence and presence of VF. Our results indicate that VF significantly increases inter-limb similarity both in terms of synergies and <b>activation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> However, the magnitude of improvement depended upon each subject. In general, VF brings the control structure of the nondominant side closer to the control structure of dominant side, suggesting that VF modifies the control structure towards more optimized motor patterns. This is especially interesting because stroke mainly affects the <b>activation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of patients and because {{it has been shown that}} the control of the affected side resembles that of the nondominant side. In conclusion, VF may enhance motor performance by effectively tuning the control-structure. Notably, this finding offers new insights to design improved stroke rehabilitation.

The aim {{of this study was to}} use the concatenated non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) technique to calculate muscle synergy components and compare the difference in muscle synergies and their associated activation profiles in the healthy and amputee groups during ramp ascending (RA) activity. Healthy subjects' dominant leg and amputee's intact leg (IL) were considered for recording surface electromyography (sEMG).

Clinically unapparent thiamin deficiency is common among sick infants (≥ 2 months old) admitted to hospital in Vientiane. This may contribute to mortality and a low clinical threshold for providing thiamin to sick infants may be needed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thiamine {{deficiency}} (beriberi) {{is common}} {{in some parts of}} southeast Asia. Acute thiamine deficiency can mimic many complications of malaria, such as encephalopathy and lactic acidosis. We examined the incidence of thiamine deficiency in adults admitted to hospital with malaria in Thailand. METHODS: For this prospective study, we recruited consecutive patients with malaria or other febrile illness who presented to Paholpolpayuhasena Hospital, Kanchanaburi, Thailand, between May and July, 1992. We used the <b>activation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (alpha) for transketolase activity in erythrocytes to measure thiamine deficiency (defined as alpha> 1. 31) in patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria and in controls (patients' relatives and healthy volunteers). To exclude the possibility of interference in the assays, transketolase activity was also measured in erythrocytes used to culture parasites. FINDINGS: 12 (52 %) of 23 patients with severe malaria and ten (19 %) of 54 patients with uncomplicated malaria had alpha values above the normal range (p< 0. 0001 and p= 0. 0014, respectively, compared with controls), which indicated severe thiamine deficiency. Thiamine deficiency was more severe in patients with cerebral malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria and the controls (p= 0. 008). INTERPRETATION: In adults admitted to hospital in Thailand, thiamine deficiency commonly complicates acute falciparum malaria, particularly in severe infections, and could contribute to dysfunction of the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{feedback}} (VF) {{is applied}} to recover motor skills after stroke. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of VF remain unclear, limiting its optimal use in clinical practice. We previously reported {{that the effect of}} neural mechanisms triggered by VF is reflected in the upperlimb {{at the level of the}} control structure (the set of synergies/corresponding <b>activation</b> <b>coefficients</b> used to perform a task). Here, we hypothesize that VF may facilitate the transfer of superior motor programs stored in the dominant hemisphere to optimize the nondominant arm’s motor control. In order to test this hypothesis we have quantified the intermanual transfer (IMT) of the dominant control structure to the nondominant arm during the execution of a complete set of standard rehabilitation routines. We demonstrate that IMT is the main mechanism by which VF increases interlimb similarity and we show that the magnitude of IMT can be up to 75...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{framework}} {{to track the}} structure of temporal networks with a signal processing approach is introduced. The method {{is based on the}} duality between static networks and signals, obtained using a multidimensional scaling technique, that makes possible the study of the network structure from frequency patterns of the corresponding signals. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify structures in temporal networks by extracting the most significant frequency patterns and their <b>activation</b> <b>coefficients</b> over time, using nonnegative matrix factorization of the temporal spectra. The framework, inspired by audio decomposition, allows transforming back these frequency patterns into networks, to highlight the evolution of the underlying structure of the network over time. The effectiveness of the method is first evidenced on a synthetic example, prior being used to study a temporal network of face-to-face contacts. The extracted sub-networks highlight significant structures decomposed on time intervals that validates the relevance of the approach on real-world data...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Plasma lipid {{peroxides}} {{were measured}} as ma-bonyldialdehyde (MDA) by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method in 75 children suffering from Plasmodiumfakiparum malaria. Their riboflavin status {{was assessed by}} measuring erythrocyte glutathione reductase <b>activation</b> <b>coefficients</b> (EGRACs), and values> 1. 40 were regarded as indicating bio-chemical deficiency. Plasma MDA was higher (p < 0. 001) in patients than in control subjects; the concentrations were 3. 65 ± 0. 70 and 1. 77 ± 0. 45 zmol/L (1 ± SD), respectively. The riboflavin-deficient group had higher plasma MDA values (3. 98 ± 0. 70 zmol/L) than did the nondeficient group (3. 30 ± 0. 68 mol/L, p < 0. 001). Plasma MDA concentrations corre-bated with EGRACs (r = 0. 46, p < 0. 01) in the patients. It is proposed that riboflavin deficiency restricts regeneration of re-duced glutathione making the parasitized erythrocytes more vulnerable to destructive lipid peroxidation and increasing plasma lipid hydroperoxides.
