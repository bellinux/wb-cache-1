Particular attention should be drawn to the recommendation related to the reorganization of the managerial structure of the Chemistry Food and Drug Division. This is seen as being a key element in the development of an effective management system, capable of implementing and carrying through to a successful conclusion the recommended programme of change. In addition to upgrading the skills of the technical staff and the capabilities of the food laboratory, a quality assurance programme was developed and instituted under the project. It is currently in operation, ensuring the quality fo the analytical results issued by the laboratory. There is, however, a need to implement an improved equipment maintenance programme.

40|$|The Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 2 Programme {{was created}} to develop and {{implement}} an EU research and innovation policy for more sustainable and resource efficient agriculture, forestry, inland water and marine systems that supply European society with sufficient food, feed, biomass, and other raw materials, as well as ecosystems services, and support thriving rural and coastal livelihoods. The European Commission has established Societal Challenge Advisory Groups to provide consistent and consolidated advice - by way of opinions, recommendations and reports - on relevant research objectives and scientific, technological and innovation priorities for its strategic and <b>annual</b> <b>work</b> <b>programmes.</b> Our Societal Challenge 2 Advisory Group includes a wide range of members with remarkably rich and diverse backgrounds and affiliations, including researchers, academics, former policymakers - stakeholders covering the whole spectrum of relevant research and innovation domains. Our Advisory Group has met twice formally since our establishment in February 2016, and has used other opportunities for extensive discussion and engagement on the issues surrounding this Societal Challenge. We see Societal Challenge 2 as not only extremely important as a challenge in itself, but also strongly linked with other Societal Challenges such as health, demographic change and wellbeing, climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials, and inclusive, innovative and reflective societies in a changing world. And as the agriculture, forestry, fisheries and food sectors comprise {{a very large number of}} smaller businesses – themselves serving large scale processing and retail business sectors – there are strong links between our contribution and the input of groups advising on innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises, international cooperation, nanotechnologies, advanced materials and advanced manufacturing and processing. Our Advisory Group‘s first task has been to prepare this report to answer five specific questions posed by the Commission and provide input into the strategic programming cycle of the Work Programme for 2018 - 2020. We have identified some overriding strategic priorities, and backed those with the results of a more detailed analysis of the gaps that need to be addressed. And we highlight the cross-cutting nature of this programme and the importance of an integrated approach to maximise the overall impact of the current Horizon 2020 programme. We hope that the insights in this report may also assist in the identification and prioritisation of research needs and strengthen the Commission‘s strategic and impact-oriented approach in future years...|$|E

40|$|National parliaments (NPs) {{had long}} been {{excluded}} from the European integration process and were in many Member States at best kept informed and rarely involved in daily EU aff airs. With the Lisbon Treaty and its introduction of the Early Warning System (EWS), {{as well as the}} Political Dialogue initiated by former Commission President Barroso, NPs have now become full actors in the EU. Th rough the Political Dialogue, they can express their opinion on the Commission <b>Annual</b> <b>Work</b> <b>Programme</b> and infl uence the Commission’s agenda. Now, through control of the respect of the principle of subsidiarity, and provided that their reasoned opinions attain the defi ned thresholds, they can potentially strike down an existing proposal. However the EWS leads to NPs still being constrained to a limited, reactive role: as ‘quasi veto-players’ and not one of ‘agenda-setter’. Recent developments in favour of the introduction of a ‘green card’ would change this situation profoundly as NPs would eventually be able to prompt the Commission to make legislative proposals on their behalf.

CEPOL brings together a network of training institutes for law enforcement officials in EU Member States and supports them in providing frontline training on security priorities, law enforcement cooperation and information exchange. CEPOL also works with EU bodies, international organisations, and third countries to ensure that the most serious security threats are tackled with a collective response.CEPOL is headed by an Executive Director, who is accountable to a Management Board. The Management Board is made up of representatives from EU Member States and the EU Commission. The chair of the Management Board is a representative of one of the three Member States that have jointly prepared the Council of the European Union’s 18-month programme. The Management Board meets at least two times per year. In addition, CEPOL has dedicated National Units (CNUs) in every Member State to provide information and assistance to law enforcement officials who wish to participate in CEPOL’s activities. CNUs also support CEPOL’s operations. The agency’s <b>annual</b> <b>work</b> <b>programme</b> is built with input from this network and other stakeholders, resulting in topical and focused activities designed {{to meet the needs of}} Member States in the priority areas of the EU internal security strategy. Moreover, CEPOL assesses training needs to address EU security priorities.CEPOL’s current portfolio encompasses residential activities, online learning (i.e. webinars, online modules, online courses, etc.), exchange programmes, common curricula, research and science.|$|R
40|$|Summary: In a large asset {{organisation}} {{the renewal}} of assets forms {{a significant portion of}} the ongoing <b>annual</b> capital <b>works</b> <b>programme.</b> Over recent years there has been an increasing focus by the energy regulators on evidence of prudent expenditure. The development of tools and processes that provide this objective evidence has become essential for the support of modern asset management practices. The approach taken by EnergyAustralia has been to develop concepts presented at past ICOMS conferences into a working repair/replace model with a simple user interface. This paper outlines the evolution of repair/replace decision making within EnergyAustralia by exploring the technical, financial and change management techniques required for practical implementation, and finally, reviews some practical examples via case studies. The model developed incorporates asset failure history to develop a view of the future risk of failure and total cost of ownership. It takes into account the realised and unrealised costs of the existing assets, and compares these to the expected costs of the replacement asset to provide a recommendation for the decision maker...|$|R
