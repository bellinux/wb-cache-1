Significant injuries suffered by Favre during the streak includes a first-degree shoulder separation, deep thigh bruise, severely bruised left hip, severely sprained left ankle, wind knocked out coupled with coughing up blood, sprained right thumb, right elbow tendinitis, left mid-foot sprain, sprained lateral collateral ligament of the left knee, broken left thumb, softball-sized bruise of the left hamstring, mild concussion, sprained right hand, injured ulnar nerve of the right elbow, bone spurs on the left ankle, torn right biceps, pulled groin, stress fracture of the left ankle coupled with an <b>avulsion</b> fracture of calcaneus, and a sprained sternoclavicular joint of the right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, <b>avulsion</b> injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most {{of history}} the {{mortality}} rate of TBI {{was thought to be}} 100%. However, in 1871 a healed TBI was noted in a duck that had been killed by a hunter, thus demonstrating that the injury could be survived, at least in the general sense. This report, made by Winslow, was the first record in the medical literature of a bronchus injury. In 1873, Seuvre made one of the earliest reports of TBI in the medical literature: a 74-year-old woman whose chest was crushed by a wagon wheel was found on autopsy to have an <b>avulsion</b> of the right bronchus. Long-term survival of the injury was unknown in humans until a report was made of a person who survived in 1927. In 1931, a report made by Nissen described successful removal of a lung in a 12-year-old girl who had had narrowing of the bronchus due to the injury. Repair of TBI was probably first attempted in 1945, when the first documented case of a successful suturing of a lacerated bronchus was made. Prior to 1950, {{the mortality rate}} was 36%; it had fallen to 9% by 2001; this improvement was likely due to improvements in treatments and surgical techniques, including those for injuries commonly associated with TBI.|$|E
30|$|Pubovisceral muscle <b>avulsions</b> {{are more}} often {{observed}} in women with POP. DeLancey et al.

40|$|Objectives: Despite {{extensive}} research aimed at clarifying (failing) pelvic organ support, the complete aetiology of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) {{is still not}} fully understood. During vaginal delivery, the pelvic floor can be irreversibly traumatised, resulting in pubovisceral muscle <b>avulsions.</b> The aetiology of these <b>avulsions</b> is discussed in this pictorial overview. Normal female pelvic floor anatomy is described and variations are exemplified using magnetic resonance (MR) images. The clinical relevance of detecting pubovisceral muscle <b>avulsions</b> is specified. Methods T 2 -weighted MR imaging has multiplanar capabilities with high diagnostic accuracy allowing for detailed visualisation of the pelvic floor. Together {{with the use of}} a three-dimensional (3 D) post-processing program, the presence and severity of pubovisceral muscle <b>avulsions</b> can be quantified.

25|$|When {{the border}} between Tennessee and Arkansas was {{established}} in 1795, it followed {{the middle of the}} Mississippi River. At that time, the river ran northwest of Reverie.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} computed tomographic (CT) myelography in the detection of root damage and differentiation of root <b>avulsions</b> from neurotmesis in a large cohort of patients with an obstetric brachial plexus lesion (OBPL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was waived by the medical ethics committee. One hundred eighteen patients with OBPL born in the cephalic position and six patients born in the breech position were selected for surgery by two neurosurgeons in a multidisciplinary team. Functional loss of the C 5 through T 1 innervated muscles was noted. All patients underwent preoperative CT myelography at {{an average age of}} 19 weeks. CT myelographic examination results were reviewed by two radiologists, who were blinded to the clinical findings, for the presence of root <b>avulsions</b> and pseudocysts. Interobserver agreement was assessed by calculating kappa values. RESULTS: CT myelographic results showed root <b>avulsions</b> in at least one level in 66 (56 %) of 118 patients born in the cephalic position and in six (100 %) of six patients born in the breech position. Levels C 7 and C 8 showed the most root <b>avulsions,</b> even if not expected from clinical examination results. A large number of root <b>avulsions</b> showed pseudocysts (73 [68 %] of 107 levels in patients born in the cephalic position and 11 [73 %] of 15 levels in patients born in the breech position). CONCLUSION: CT myelographic results showed root <b>avulsions</b> in more than half of patients with OBPL. Root <b>avulsions</b> were even detected at levels that were not expected at clinical examination. Because root <b>avulsions</b> require specific reconstructive techniques, CT myelography is recommended for every preoperative patient with OBPL...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{reported}} scapular <b>avulsions</b> occurred due to high-energy trauma and {{in combination with other}} fractures.

40|$|<b>Avulsions</b> {{and severe}} {{intrusions}} are associated withpoor post-treatment outcomes. Management ofboth <b>avulsions</b> and intrusions is controversial: <b>avulsions</b> present {{the dilemma of}} whether or not to replant, whereas intrusions have the widest choice of treatment options. Every trauma intervention should be guided by application of the best scientific evidence integrated with the clinician’s expertise and the values and expectations of patients and their parents. Yet dentists may be “rusty ” in both clinical techniques and application of research-based information, primarily because of the rarity of such events. Clinical guidelines should incorporate the best research evidence and techniques, as well as the means to explore the expectations of patients and their parents. This review of recent research and the changing management of <b>avulsions</b> and intrusions identifies the controversies and clarifies clinical options...|$|R
25|$|Based on the {{sedimentary}} deposits at the site, the two Dreadnoughtus schrani specimens {{appear to}} have been buried quickly during a fluvial <b>avulsion</b> event, or break in a levee resulting in a flood. This event generated a liquefacted crevasse splay deposit which entombed the two dinosaurs. Thus, rapid and relatively deep burial of the Dreadnoughtus type specimen accounts for its extraordinary completeness. Numerous small theropod teeth found amongst the bones are likely evidence of scavenging, most likely by megaraptorans, perhaps Orkoraptor.|$|E
25|$|Also {{near the}} end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, {{altering}} its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the Teesta River, which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an <b>avulsion),</b> shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of Mymensingh and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra. The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of Langalbandh, is still considered sacred by Hindus. Near the confluence is a major early historic site called Wari-Bateshwar.|$|E
25|$|Dental <b>avulsion</b> {{is a real}} dental {{emergency}} in which prompt management (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed permanent tooth should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage {{the surface of the}} root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the alveolar bone and later splinted by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt).|$|E

50|$|Eyelid <b>avulsions</b> are uncommon, but can {{be caused}} by motor vehicle collisions, dog bites, or human bites. Eyelid <b>avulsions</b> are {{repaired}} by suturing after a CT scan is performed to determine where damage to the muscles, nerves, and blood vessels of the eyelid has occurred. More severe injuries require reconstruction, however, this usually results in some loss of function and subsequent surgeries may be necessary to improve structure and function. Microvascular surgery is another method of repair but is rarely used to treat eye <b>avulsions.</b> Sometimes botulinum toxin is injected into the eyelid to paralyze the muscles while the eyelid heals.|$|R

Bryant also became the youngest player (31 years, 151 days) to reach 25,000 points during the season, surpassing Chamberlain. He continued his dominant clutch plays making yet another game-winning three-pointer against the Sacramento Kings, and what would be the game-winning field goal against the Boston Celtics. The following day, he surpassed West to become the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. After being sidelined for five games from an ankle injury, Bryant made his return and made another clutch three-pointer to give the Lakers a one-point lead with four seconds remaining against the Memphis Grizzlies. Two weeks later, he made his sixth game-winning shot of the season against the Toronto Raptors.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. Of the 81 Tyrannosaurus foot bones examined in the study one was found to have a stress fracture, while none of the 10 hand bones were found to have stress fractures. The researchers found tendon avulsions only among Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus. An <b>avulsion</b> injury left a divot on the humerus of Sue the T.rex, apparently located at the origin of the deltoid or teres major muscles. The presence of <b>avulsion</b> injuries being limited to the forelimb and shoulder in both Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex than and functionally different from those of birds. The researchers concluded that Sue's tendon <b>avulsion</b> was probably obtained from struggling prey. The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions in general provides evidence for a [...] "very active" [...] predation-based diet rather than obligate scavenging.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. Allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon <b>avulsion,</b> and in both cases the <b>avulsion</b> occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that Allosaurus had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than Albertosaurus, Ornithomimus or Archaeornithomimus. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones [...] "were distributed to the proximal phalanges" [...] and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in [...] "statistically indistinguishable" [...] numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined Allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and <b>avulsion</b> injuries in Allosaurus provide evidence for [...] "very active" [...] predation-based rather than scavenging diets.|$|E

Flooding also affected the Pacific coast along the Gulf of Fonseca, leaving behind debris and sediment.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{superiority of}} a single stage {{combined}} anterior (first) posterior (second) approach and end-to-side side-to-side grafting neurorrhaphy in direct cord implantation was investigated as to providing adequate exposure to both the cervical cord and the brachial plexus, as to causing less tissue damage and as to being more extensible than current surgical approaches. Methods The front and back of the neck, {{the front and back}} of the chest up to the midline and the whole affected upper limb were sterilized while the patient was in the lateral position; the patient was next turned into the supine position, the plexus explored anteriorly and the grafts were placed; the patient was then turned again into the lateral position, and a posterior cervical laminectomy was done. The grafts were retrieved posteriorly and side grafted to the anterior cord. Using this approach, 5 patients suffering from complete traumatic brachial plexus palsy, 4 adults and 1 obstetric case were operated upon and followed up for 2 years. 2 were C 5, 6 ruptures and C 7, 8 T 1 <b>avulsions.</b> 3 were C 5, 6, 7, 8 T 1 <b>avulsions.</b> C 5, 6 ruptures were grafted and all <b>avulsions</b> were cord implanted. Results Surgery in complete <b>avulsions</b> led to Grade 4 improvement in shoulder abduction/flexion and elbow flexion. Cocontractions occurred between the lateral deltoid and biceps on active shoulder abduction. No cocontractions occurred after surgery in C 5, 6 ruptures and C 7, 8 T 1 <b>avulsions,</b> muscle power improvement extended into the forearm and hand; pain disappeared. Limitations include spontaneous recovery despite MRI appearance of <b>avulsions,</b> fallacies in determining intraoperative <b>avulsions</b> (wrong diagnosis, wrong level); small sample size; no controls rule out superiority of this technique versus other direct cord reimplantation techniques or other neurotization procedures; intra- and interobserver variability in testing muscle power and cocontractions. Conclusion Through providing proper exposure to the brachial plexus and to the cervical cord, the single stage combined anterior (first) and posterior (second) approach might stimulate brachial plexus surgeons to go more for direct cord implantation. In this study, it allowed for placing side grafts along an extensive donor recipient area by end-to-side, side-to-side grafting neurorrhaphy and thus improved results.
