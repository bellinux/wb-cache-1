30|$|Tsakias et al. {{address this}} {{prediction}} task as a two-steps classification problem: predict if news <b>articles</b> <b>will</b> receive comments {{and if they}} do, {{if the number of}} comments will be high or low [71]. The proposed prediction method is a random forest classifier trained on a large number of features (textual, semantic, and real-world). Using several Dutch online news sources the authors show that one can accurately predict which <b>articles</b> <b>will</b> receive comments and observe that the performance degrades significantly when trying to predict if the volume of comments will be high or low.|$|R

25|$|Most of Kierkegaard's later {{philosophical}} and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works.

25|$|Neuropharmacology is a {{very broad}} region of science that {{encompasses}} {{many aspects of the}} nervous system from single neuron manipulation to entire areas of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. To better understand the basis behind drug development, one must first understand how neurons communicate with one another. This <b>article</b> <b>will</b> focus on both behavioral and molecular neuropharmacology; the major receptors, ion channels, and neurotransmitters manipulated through drug action and how people with a neurological disorder benefit from this drug action.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, LAPD Chief Jerry Karlin (Baker) learns of Fletch's drug article. He warns Fletch {{that the}} <b>article</b> <b>will</b> {{jeopardize}} his undercover operation on the beach.

At the tennis club, Fletch overhears an arrogant club member, Mr. Underhill, insulting a waiter and decides to use Underhill's tab to treat Gail to an expensive lunch in her private cabana. Fletch reveals Alan's murder scheme to her and tells her the true price of the ranch.|$|E
25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the 16th century, the great Renaissance began to elbow its way in to the exclusion of Gothic design. But the process was not sudden, and much transition work has great merit. The rood screen at Hurst, Berkshire, the stall work of Cartmel Priory, Westmorland, and the bench ends of many of the churches in Somerset, give good illustrations. But the new style was unequal to the old in devotional feeling, except in classic buildings like St Paul's Cathedral, where the stalls of Grinling Gibbons better suit their own surroundings. The rest of this <b>article</b> <b>will</b> therefore be devoted in the main to domestic work, and the exact location of examples can only be given when not the property of private owners or where the public have access.|$|E

Ptail data are separated out into three streams {{so they can}} eventually be sent to their own clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen {{the number of times}} needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot <b>article</b> <b>will</b> generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hash table.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{languages}} are a fairly closely linked set of languages {{which can be}} broken up using a number of different criteria. Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of Igloolik versus the dialect of Iqaluit, for example. However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit languages because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary. This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic. This <b>article</b> <b>will</b> use labels that try to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum. This scheme {{is not the only one}} used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.|$|E
