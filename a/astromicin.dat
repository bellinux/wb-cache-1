5000|$|<b>Astromicin</b> (INN)(also {{frequently}} referenced {{in scientific}} journal articles as compounds Fortimicin A/B [...] ) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Synthesized from Micromonospora olivasterospora(also named with additional o in olivoasterospora).|$|E
40|$|When {{compared}} with <b>astromicin,</b> amikacin, gentamicin, and sisomicin, dactimicin {{was similar to}} <b>astromicin</b> in in vitro activity and was more active than amikacin and gentamicin against the clinical isolates of Serratia marcescens, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dactimicin and <b>astromicin</b> were active against many gentamicin- and amikacin-resistant bacteria expressing aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, {{with the exception of}} aminoglycoside 3 -acetyltransferase. However, dactimicin was more resistant than <b>astromicin</b> to inactivation by aminoglycoside 3 -acetyltransferase, probably owing to the protective action of the formimidoyl group. The in vivo activity of dactimicin, assessed by the 50 % effective doses against systemic infections in mice, was similar or superior to that of <b>astromicin</b> and was superior or inferior to that of amikacin depending on the strains tested...|$|E
40|$|ASTM 200 mg筋注後の前立腺組織内濃度を前立腺肥大症患者にて測定した結果, 3. 79 ± 1. 01 μg/gの組織内濃度を得た. この濃度は経口投与剤であるenoxacinの前立腺組織内濃度とほぼ匹敵するものと考えられたThe {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the penetration of <b>astromicin</b> sulfate into prostatic tissue. Twenty eight patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy entered the study. <b>Astromicin</b> sulfate was administered as an intramuscular injection in a dose of 200 mg one hour preoperatively. Blood samples were taken simultaneously with the tissue sampling at the transurethral resection of the prostate. The mean concentration of <b>astromicin</b> sulfate in prostatic tissue was 3. 79 +/- 1. 01 micrograms/g and that in serum was 10. 25 +/- 2. 70 micrograms/ml...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes in}} Serratia marcescens induced by <b>astromicin</b> {{were determined by}} a new technique of electron microscopy, a rapid freezing and substitution fixation technique, and a freeze-fracturing technique. Two structural changes were observed. One was damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, {{and the other was}} the accumulation of a large electron-dense mass in the cytoplasm. The damage observed in the cytoplasmic membrane was the disappearance of the unit membrane structure from the thin-sectioned profile of the drug-treated bacteria and the loss of the membrane particles from the fractured surface of the membrane. Damage to the membrane was also suggested by the results of examination of the spheroplasts for stability. The spheroplasts prepared from the drug-treated bacteria were unstable in an osmotically controlled buffer. Most of the spheroplasts were lysed within 3 h, whereas those prepared from control cells were stable for more than 15 h. The electron-dense mass in the cytoplasm was usually seen in the polar region of the cell in close contact with the cell membrane. These structural changes were not specific for <b>astromicin</b> but were also found in gentamicin-treated cells...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{efficient}} gene-cloning system for Micromonospora olivasterospora, {{a producer of}} the antibiotic fortimicin A (<b>astromicin),</b> suited to shotgun cloning has been developed. The system is supported by two new advancements accomplished in this study. One is the construction of novel plasmid vectors pMO 116, pMO 126, pMO 133, pMO 136, and pMO 217, all consisting of replicons from newly found Micromonospora plasmids and selectable markers cloned from a neomycin-producing Micromonospora strain. The other advancement is {{the establishment of a}} new protocol for bacterial protoplasting in which some kinds of sugar alcohols are added in precultures. Such sugar alcohols were found to sensitize a wide taxonomical range of bacteria to lysozyme. The system is reproducible and reliable and has a high efficiency of more than 10 (6) CFU/micrograms of DNA...|$|E
40|$|Fortimicin-A (FTM-A; <b>astromicin)</b> -resistance genes vmr genes) {{isolated}} from six {{producers of the}} FTM-group of antibiotics were analysed. These genes could be classified into two types by the resistance profiles to aminoglycoside antibiotics and by their DNA homologies. Three genes, fmr T from the istamycin producer Streptomyces tenjimariensis ATCC 3 1603, fmrS from the sannamycin producer Streptomyces sannanensis IF 0 14239 and fmrH from the sporaricin producer Saccharopolyspora hirsuta ATCC 20501, conferred resistance to FTM-A, kanamycin (Km) and neomycin B (Nm-B), but not to gentamicin (Gm). The other three genes, fmr 0 from the FTM-A producer Micromonospora olivasterospora ATCC 21819, fmrM from the antibiotic SF- 2052 producer Micromonospora sp. SF- 2098 (ATCC 31580) and fmrD from the dactimicin producer Dactylosporangium matsuzakiense ATCC 31570, conferred resistance to FTM-A, Km and Gm, but not to Nm-B. No DNA homology was detected between {{the two types of}} the resistance genes in Southern-blot analysis. The present results revealed that, in spite of the similarity of their biosynthesis genes, {{there are at least two}} different types of resistance genes among the FTM-group antibiotic producers...|$|E
40|$|A novel gene {{encoding}} an aminoglycoside 3 -N-acetyltransferase, which confers {{resistance to}} gentamicin, <b>astromicin,</b> and sisomicin, was cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Stone 130. Its sequence was determined {{and found to}} show considerable similarity to an aac(3) -I gene previously cloned from R plasmids from Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Serratia spp. We have designated the genes from the R plasmids and this work aac(3) -Ia and aac(3) -Ib, respectively. The two aac(3) -I genes share 74 % nucleotide identity, and their deduced protein products are 88 % similar. These {{data suggest that the}} genes derive from a common ancestor. Homology between the flanking sequences of both aac(3) -I genes and other resistance determinants known to reside in integron environments was also observed. Intragenic probes specific for either aac(3) -Ia or aac(3) -Ib were used in hybridization studies with a series of gentamicin-, astromicin-, and sisomicin-resistant clinical isolates. Of 59 clinical isolates tested, no isolates hybridized with both probes, 30 (51 %) hybridized with the aac(3) -Ia probe, 12 (20 %) hybridized with the aac(3) -Ib probe, and 17 (29 %) did not hybridize with either probe. These data suggest the existence of at least one other aac(3) -I gene...|$|E
