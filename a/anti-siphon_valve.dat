50|$|Note {{that the}} <b>anti-siphon</b> <b>valve</b> in medical shunts is {{preventing}} excess forward flow of liquid. In plumbing systems, the <b>anti-siphon</b> <b>valve</b> is preventing backflow.|$|E
5000|$|Building codes often contain {{specific}} {{sections on}} back siphonage {{and especially for}} external faucets (See the sample building code quote, below). Backflow prevention devices such as anti-siphon valves are required in such designs. The reason is that external faucets may be attached to hoses which may be immersed in an external body of water, such as a garden pond, swimming pool, aquarium or washing machine. In these situations the flow is not actually a siphon but suction due to reduced pressure on the water supply side. Should the pressure within the water supply system fall, the external water may be returned by back pressure into the drinking water system through the faucet. Another possible contamination point is the water intake in the toilet tank. An <b>anti-siphon</b> <b>valve</b> is also required here to prevent pressure drops in the water supply line from suctioning {{water out of the}} toilet tank (which may contain additives such as [...] "toilet blue") and contaminating the water system. Anti-siphon valves function as a one-direction check valve.|$|E
50|$|Along with <b>anti-siphon</b> <b>valves,</b> <b>anti-siphoning</b> devices also exist. The two are {{unrelated}} in application. Siphoning {{can be used}} {{to remove}} fuel from tanks. With the cost of fuel increasing, it has been linked in several countries to the rise in fuel theft. Trucks, with their large fuel tanks, are most vulnerable. The anti-siphon device prevents thieves from inserting a tube into the fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|<b>Anti-siphon</b> <b>valves</b> {{are also}} used medically. Hydrocephalus, or excess fluid in the brain, may be treated with a shunt which drains {{cerebrospinal}} fluid from the brain. All shunts have a valve to relieve excess pressure in the brain. The shunt may lead into the abdominal cavity such that the shunt outlet is {{significantly lower than the}} shunt intake when the patient is standing. Thus a siphon effect may take place and instead of simply relieving excess pressure, the shunt may act as a siphon, completely draining cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. The valve in the shunt may be designed to prevent this siphon action so that negative pressure on the drain of the shunt does not result in excess drainage. Only excess positive pressure from within the brain should result in drainage.|$|R
