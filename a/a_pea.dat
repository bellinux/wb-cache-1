5|$|Highly innervated, the glans {{exists at}} the tip of the {{clitoral}} body as a fibro-vascular cap, and is usually the size and shape of <b>a</b> <b>pea,</b> although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the glans is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Thrud is sent to Crom the Destroyer Orthodox Pagan Infants School, {{where he}} towers above the {{teachers}} and his fellow students. When {{one of the children}} shoots him with <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> shooter, Thrud's reaction is to kill and maim twenty-seven pupils and three teachers, leading to his expulsion from the school. Choosing to return to the wilderness rather than his adoptive parents, Thrud lives alone until, one day, he stumbles across a hidden burial chamber. Finding a small helmet and a large axe, Thrud arms himself. Finding gold and gems, he decides to return to civilisation with his newfound wealth, quickly establishing himself a reputation as a violent warrior.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of <b>a</b> <b>pea,</b> and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E

5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} documented a {{wide range}} of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of ephedrine as a drug. It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica {{that could be used to}} cure ills through digestion. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> to a walnut.|$|E

25|$|In 1883 {{he began}} experimenting with pea-whistle designs that could produce an intense sound that could grab {{attention}} from over a mile away.

Observing how the discordant sound of the breaking strings travelled (trill effect), Hudson had the idea to put <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> in the whistle. Prior to this, whistles were much quieter, and were only thought of as musical instruments or toys for children. After observing the problems that local police were having with effectively communicating with rattles, he realised that his whistle designs {{could be used as}} an effective aid to their work.|$|E

500|$|The story {{tells of}} a prince who wants to marry a princess, but is having {{difficulty}} finding a suitable wife. Something is always wrong with those he meets, and he cannot be certain they are real princesses because they have bad table manners or they are too fat or thin or not beautiful. [...] One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She {{claims to be a}} princess, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting guest by placing <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by 20 mattresses and 20 feather-beds. In the morning, the guest tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by something hard in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. The prince rejoices. Only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> through such a quantity of bedding, so the two are married.|$|E
500|$|In his {{preface to}} the second volume of Tales and Stories (1863) Andersen claims to have heard the story in his childhood, but the tale {{has never been a}} {{traditional}} one in Denmark. He may as a child have heard a Swedish version, [...] "Princess Who Lay on Seven Peas" [...] ("Princessa' som lå' på sju ärter"), which tells of an orphan girl who establishes her identity after a sympathetic helper (a cat or a dog) informs her that an object (a bean, <b>a</b> <b>pea,</b> or a straw) had been placed under her mattress.|$|E

Each player then draws a numbered pea from the bottle. The number of the pea drawn assigns to that player the correspondingly numbered , which that player must keep secret from his opponents. The object {{of the game is}} for the player to legally pocket their assigned, undisclosed ball (sometimes called their [...] "private number").|$|E

500|$|The Buckeye is a {{breed of}} chicken {{originating}} in the U.S. state of Ohio. Created in the late 19th century, Buckeyes are the only American Poultry Association (APA) standard breed of chicken {{known to have been}} created by a woman, and {{the only one in the}} American Class to have <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> comb. As of 2014, Buckeyes are listed as [...] "Threatened" [...] by The Livestock Conservancy. The breed's name is derived from Ohio's nickname of [...] "Buckeye state", and their mahogany color is said ideally to resemble the seeds of the Ohio Buckeye plant (Aesculus glabra). They are a dual-purpose chicken that have a decent laying ability and strong meat production characteristics. Buckeyes are yellow skinned chickens that lay brown eggs.|$|E
500|$|Pricing {{is similar}} to other {{restaurants}} owned by Ramsay, and {{it is intended to}} bring a fine dining experience out of specialist airport lounges and make it available to any traveller. Starters include <b>a</b> <b>pea,</b> leek and goat cheese tart, while mains include sea bass which is steamed and served alongside lemongrass and white asparagus. Chocolate fondue with marshmallows and waffles are among the options for dessert as well as a knickerbocker glory. Traditional fine dining dishes are also included on the menu, such as Sevruga caviar. Ramsay said in interviews around the launch of the restaurant that he aimed to keep [...] "it all very lean, lean, lean. No heavy sauces". He compared the menu to a cross between The Ivy, his own Boxwood Cafe and The Wolseley. A specific menu is offered for quick dining, called [...] "Plane Fast". This has multiple-course meals which aim to be served within 25 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Wullschlager {{observes that}} in [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] Andersen blended his {{childhood}} {{memories of a}} primitive world of violence, death, and inexorable fate, with his social climber's private romance about the serene, secure and cultivated Danish bourgeoisie, which did not quite accept {{him as one of}} their own. Researcher Jack Zipes said that Andersen, during his lifetime, [...] "was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer"; Andersen therefore developed a feared and loved view of the aristocracy. Others have said that Andersen constantly felt as though he did not belong, and longed {{to be a part of}} the upper class. The nervousness and humiliations Andersen suffered in the presence of the bourgeoisie were mythologized by the storyteller in the tale of [...] "The Princess and the Pea", with Andersen himself the morbidly sensitive princess who can feel <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> through 20mattresses.|$|E

500|$|Tales {{of extreme}} {{sensitivity}} are infrequent in world culture {{but a few}} have been recorded. The 11th-century Kathasaritsagara by Somadeva tells {{of a young man}} who claims to be especially fastidious about beds. After sleeping in a bed on top of seven mattresses, and newly made with clean sheets, the young man rises in great pain. A crooked red mark is discovered on his body, and upon investigation a hair is found on the bottom-most mattress of the bed. [...] An Italian tale called [...] "The Most Sensitive Woman" [...] tells of a woman whose foot is bandaged after a jasmine petal falls upon it. The Brothers Grimm included a [...] "Princess on the Pea" [...] tale in an edition of their Kinder- und Hausmärchen, but removed it after they discovered that it belonged to the Danish literary tradition. A few folk tales feature a boy discovering <b>a</b> <b>pea</b> or a bean assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night he tosses and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw, and is therefore of aristocratic blood.|$|E
