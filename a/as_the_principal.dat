40|$|This {{chapter in}} a {{forthcoming}} book justifies the conventional characterization of common-law agency as a fiduciary relationship. An agent serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> representative in dealings with third parties and {{facts about the}} world, situating <b>the</b> agent <b>as</b> an extension of <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> for legally-salient purposes. A principal’s power to furnish instructions to the agent is the fundamental mechanism through which <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> exercises control over the agent, a requisite for an agency relationship. The agent’s fiduciary duty to <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> provides a benchmark for the agent’s interpretation of those instructions. The chapter draws on philosophical literature on {{the identity of the}} self over time to address related characteristics of agency doctrine, including the agent’s duty to interpret instructions and statements of authority in light of <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> present wishes <b>as</b> <b>the</b> agent reasonably understands them <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> ongoing power to revoke the agent’s authority even when the revocation constitutes a breach of contract...|$|R
