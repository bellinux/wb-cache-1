5|$|The {{visit was}} {{the high point of}} {{relations}} between Diệm and Washington, as in later years, the US government and members of the AFV became increasingly disillusioned with Diệm's failure to liberalize his government and enact changes to make South Vietnam more democratic. The once-supportive media began to report on South Vietnam without overlooking problems in Diệm's administration. In 1963, <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Diệm collapsed during the Buddhist crisis as Washington concluded that Diệm was incapable of offering a solid alternative to the communists, and he was overthrown in a US-backed military coup and executed after being captured.|$|E
5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events had a profound effect on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|Kirill {{suffered}} {{a nervous breakdown}} in 1923 and Victoria nursed him back to health. She encouraged his dreams of restoring the monarchy in Russia and becoming Tsar. At Saint-Briac Kirill, aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and his only son, officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Victoria went {{on a trip to}} the United States in 1924, hoping to raise <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> restoration of the monarchy. Her efforts evoked little response, due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s. She continued in her efforts to help Kirill restore the monarchy and also sold her artwork {{to raise money for the}} household.|$|E

50|$|Soon thereafter, {{however, the}} {{editorial}} {{staff of the}} Messenger became divided by three issues - the growing rift between West Indian and African <b>Americans,</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Bolshevik revolution, and <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa movement. In 1919, most West Indian radicals joined the new Communist Party, while African-American leftists - Randolph included - mostly supported the Socialist Party.

5|$|On 18 September 1961 Hammarskjöld flew to Ndola, {{just across}} the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a {{cease-fire}} between UN and Katangese forces. His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Émpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In December 1961, South Kasai was finally overrun by ANC troops and Kalonji was arrested, ending the South Kasai secession.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the visit, the US {{government}} and the AFV made thorough preparations to make Diệm's visit pleasant, and the AFV successfully lobbied the media to write favourable reports on the South Vietnamese leader. Diệm was trumpeted {{as a champion of}} democracy, and mentions of his autocratic style and election rigging were avoided. Diệm arrived by plane in Washington, D.C. on May 8, and was personally greeted at the airport by President Dwight D. Eisenhower—an honor Eisenhower accorded to only one other visiting head of state. Diệm's motorcade was greeted by 50,000 wellwishers and his address to the US Congress and his policies were heartily endorsed by both sides of politics. During his time in the US capital, Diệm also attended receptions, and had private meetings with both Eisenhower and the US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, to discuss <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> South Vietnam, although the meeting with Dulles was ineffectual as Diệm spoke continuously, rendering two-way discussions impossible.|$|E

25|$|Burma {{accepted}} {{foreign assistance}} in rebuilding {{the country in}} these early years, but continued <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Chinese Nationalist military presence in Burma finally resulted in the country rejecting most foreign aid, refusing to join the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and supporting the Bandung Conference of 1955.

25|$|On May 26, a large pro-Buddhist crowd {{attended}} {{the funeral of}} the rebel ARVN lieutenant who was killed after shooting at General Cao's departing helicopter. Afterward, the protestors rioted and burned down the US Information Service Library. Over the next week, three Buddhist clergy self-immolated in protest at US policies.

25|$|As a result, in March 1916 Villa led {{the remains}} of his Division del Norte on a raid on the American town of Columbus in New Mexico. Some sources {{attribute}} the raid to <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Carranza, while others {{point to the fact}} that some Columbus residents had cheated Villa out of money he had paid for armaments. This in turn resulted in the failed Mexican Expedition, led by Gen. John J. Pershing whose purpose was to capture Villa or kill him.|$|E
25|$|Bulgarian-American relations, first {{formally}} {{established in}} 1903, {{have moved from}} missionary activity and <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Bulgarian independence in the late 19th century {{to the growth of}} trade and commerce in the early 20th century, to reluctant hostility during World War I and open war and bombardment in World War II, to ideological confrontation during the Cold War, to partnership with the United States in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and growing political, military and economic ties {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1940s, the {{relations}} with Argentina have been tense, when the U.S. feared regime of General Peron {{was too close}} to Nazi Germany. In 1954, <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état against the democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán fueled anti-Americanism in the region. This CIA-sponsored coup prompted a former president of that country, Juan José Arévalo to write a fable entitled The Shark and the Sardines (1961) in which a predatory shark (representing the United States) overawes the sardines of Latin America.|$|E

50|$|Garthwaite and Moore {{also showed}} that the {{connection}} is not because people who read women's magazines preferred Obama to Clinton.

25|$|However, <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Carranza now {{went beyond}} {{political}} recognition and diplomacy. The US placed an embargo {{on sales of}} arms to Villa. More crucially, President Wilson gave his permission for Carranzista troops to cross through American territory in order to strengthen the garrison at Agua Prieta. About 3,500 fresh, veteran troops traveled through Arizona and New Mexico and arrived in the town in early October, bringing {{the total number of}} defenders to 6,500. Villa was completely unaware of this development; according to American correspondent and friend of Villa John W. Roberts, Villa believed the town was defended by only 1,200 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|After {{attempts}} to plant small settlements {{on the coast}} of west Africa, the A.C.S. established the colony of Liberia in 1821–22. Over the next four decades, it assisted thousands of former slaves and free black people to move there from the United States. The disease environment they encountered was extreme, and most migrants died fairly quickly. Enough survived to declare independence in 1847. <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> colonization waned gradually through the 1840s and 1850s, largely because of the efforts of abolitionists to promote emancipation of slaves and the granting of United States citizenship. The Americo-Liberians established an elite who ruled Liberia continuously until the military coup of 1980.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October, American {{ambassador}} Winthrop G. Brown, {{in ongoing}} attempts at mending the national split, asked King Sisavang Vatthana {{to form a}} caretaker government that would include both sides. Former ambassador and serving Assistant Secretary of State J. Graham Parsons flew in to pressure Souvanna Phouma into breaking contact with the Soviets. On 17 October, his companion, John N. Irwin II, flew south to Ubon to assure Phoumi of U.S. support. Also in early October, the U.S. suspended aid to Laos. Vang Pao declared that Military Region 2's forces backed Phoumi. After internecine struggle, by 10 November, Military Region 1 remained in Phoumi's control. On 9 November, after agreeing to accept Soviet aid, Souvanna named his new cabinet. It included Quinim Pholsena {{and a couple of}} Pathet Lao officials. This solidified <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Phoumi. Moreover, on 16 November, General Ouane changed sides; he flew to Savannakhet to join Phoumi.|$|E

25|$|The ICU, which {{controlled}} the coastal areas of southern Somalia, engaged in {{fighting with the}} forces of the Somali TFG, and the autonomous regional governments of Puntland and Galmudug, all of whom were backed by Ethiopian troops. The outbreak of heavy fighting began on December 20 with the Battle of Baidoa, after the lapse of a one-week deadline the ICU imposed on Ethiopia (on December 12) to withdraw from the nation. Ethiopia, however, refused to abandon its positions around the TFG interim capital at Baidoa. On December 29, after several successful battles, TFG and Ethiopian troops entered Mogadishu relatively unopposed. The UN also stated that many Arab nations including Egypt were also supporting the ICU through Eritrea. Although not announced until later, a small number of U.S. Special Forces troops accompanied Ethiopian and TFG troops after the collapse and withdrawal of the ICU to give military advice and to track suspected al-Qaida fighters. Both <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the TFG and various Arab Nations' support for the ICU were isolated cases from the central motive of the war between the allied Ethiopian & Somali government forces and the allied ICU & Eritrean forces.|$|E
25|$|Lady Avon was the {{youngest}} wife of an incumbent Prime Minister in the twentieth century. She was only 36 when her husband resigned, and was widowed at 56. She has outlived four later Prime Ministerial spouses (but is four years younger than Lady Wilson of Rievaulx, widow of Harold Wilson, the only spouse to have become a centenarian) and seen the administrations of 11 subsequent Prime Ministers. By contrast, Lady Dorothy Macmillan was 57 when her husband succeeded Eden and 63 when he resigned, dying just three years later, her husband outliving her by 20 years. As such Lady Avon has enjoyed unusual longevity for a Prime Ministerial spouse, contributing, for example, to a television documentary by Cherie Blair in 2005 about Prime Ministers' wives and to a three-part series the following year marking the fiftieth anniversary of Suez. In the latter, she recalled, among other things, Eden's disillusion {{with the lack of}} <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> British policy in 1956. The critic A. A. Gill was among those who praised Lady Avon's erudite performance in the Blair documentary ("bright as a button"), while sensing that she appeared not entirely to approve of Mrs Blair.|$|E
25|$|The three {{deaths were}} the only Americans killed {{as a result of}} attacks on American ships by German {{submarine}} until 16 March 1917, when diplomatic relations had irreparably broken down just before the declaration of war. American official reaction to the incident was determined by President Woodrow Wilson under the advice of United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and Counselor to the State Department Robert Lansing. Bryan favoured reconciliation with Germany and avoidance of war, but this policy was becoming increasingly unpopular and was opposed by his subordinate Lansing. Lansing submitted a memorandum proposing immediate and vigorous protest and coupled with the Cushing incident and the sinking of RMS Lusitania on 7 May, a British ship but carrying American passengers who drowned, president Wilson made a forceful response to Germany. In June Bryan resigned and was replaced by Lansing. Despite his belligerent formal advice, Lansing's private papers suggest that he considered the rights and wrongs of the situation much more finely balanced and the logical outcome ought to have been impartial military trade sanctions against both belligerents. However, the US economy was already heavily committed to producing military supplies for the British, while <b>American</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> {{one side or the other}} was likely to prove decisive in choosing the eventual victor.|$|E
