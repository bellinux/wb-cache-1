40|$|Abstract: Stability {{reliability}} analysis of abutment rock of arch dam {{is a very}} complicated problem which must be studied and solved. Generally, entirely sliding stability {{reliability analysis}} should be made when abutment rock bounded by structure planes like fault, joints and fissures, and layers is possible to slide. Due to the complex causes and structures, diverse litholigy, different rocks have different mechanics attributes. While the physical and mechanical parameters of the same rocks are of obvious dispersion and uncertainty. And it is also complex to calculate the pushing force at <b>arch</b> <b>abutment</b> on dam abutment rock, because the uncertain factors as water pressure, sediment, variable temperatures and materials parameters are contained. In this essay, based on Stochastic Finite Element Method, the formula of sliding stability reliability analysis of dam abutment rock is given.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} the abutment forces of a double-curvature arch dam during overload based on numerical calculation results obtained through finite element method by Ansys. Results show that, {{with an increase in}} elevation, the abutment forces and bending moment of the arch dam increase first and then decrease from the bottom {{to the top of the}} dam. Abutment forces and bending moment reach their maximum at the middle or middle-down portion of the dam. The distributions of abutment forces and moment do not change during overload. The magnitude of each arch layer’s forces and moment increases linearly during overload. This result indicates that each arch layer transmits bearing loads to the rocks of the left and right banks steadily. This research explains the operating mechanism of an arch dam under normal and overload conditions. It provides a simple method to calculate the distribution of forces Fx and Fy and a new method to calculate the overload factor of an arch dam through the estimation of arch layers based on the redistribution characteristic of <b>arch</b> <b>abutment</b> forces...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is related to {{verification}} of wind induced dynamic response of the Svinesund Bridge in the time domain {{by the use of}} autoregressive simulations. This thesis starts by giving a theoretical study in the field of time–series simulation of wind induced dynamic loading, with emphasis on the Schur decomposition by AR model and polynomial approximation. This is a procedure that generates a multivariate wind field velocity vector by decomposing the PSD matrix into the basis of the eigenvectors. The advantages of this method is that very few spectral modes exhibit significant power, meaning that one could truncate the spectral modal matrix only evaluating the m first eigenvectors (m << n). Another advantage is that each component of the eigenvectors are very regular functions, which is true independent of the analytical model assumed for the PSD function. This allows, by the use of standard finite element procedure for approximating the eigenvectors, the generation procedure, via standard AR model, to only require a limited number of samples of univariate coherent processes to describe the multivariate wind field, and this number is independent of the number of components in the process. Another advantage making use of the regularity of eigenvectors is that {{only a small number of}} subdivision frequencies are needed to approximate the eigenvectors in a polynomial form by a standard finite element procedure. All these advantages combines makes this a very computational effective procedure for generation of a multivariate wind field velocity vector. As a bonus the physical meaning of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the PSD matrix provides useful information about the stochastic wind process in view of a structural analysis. This because the eigenvalues could be seen as the power of n independent processes W_{ 1 }(t), [...] .,W_{n}(t), while the eigenvectors are mode shapes, similar to the structural modes, associated with the wind field velocity. After the theory is explained an explanation of how the time domain simulations of wind induced dynamic response was created using the NatHaz On-line Wind Simulator (NOWS) is given. Here a discussion regarding choices made in regard to different inputs to NOWS as well as how the simulated wind field velocities was to be applied onto the FEM. These simulations was then applied to a finite element model of the Svinesund Bridge, created in the computer software Abaqus, using several different strategies. Then results were extracted from the model in the form of accelerations from these simulations. These accelerations along with the simulated wind field velocities was then compared with real measurements obtained when the storm Per passed Svinesund Bridge on January 14, 2007. After comparing many different velocities and accelerations from different simulations to the measured response it was concluded that the "Full in 2 points" simulation with approach z_{ 1 } created the best representation of the measured response. The "Full in 2 points" simulation uses a drag coefficient of C_{D}= 0. 15 on both the windward and the leeward box girder, while the arch has a drag coefficient of C_{D}= 0. 8. The z_{ 1 } approach indicate that the z-coordinates should be given as if the surface is raising linearly between the sea and the arch abutments, and between each <b>arch</b> <b>abutment</b> and pier 5 and 8. NOWS seems to assume that the terrain under a structure is plane, and therefore seems to use the z-coordinates for both defining the height of a point and the spatial separation between to points. So when z_{ 1 } was the most correct approach this would indicate that getting the correct height of each point in a simulation is more important than getting a correct spacial representation of the nodes. It was also concluded that exposure category A and B are ill suited for this location, but that it was difficult concluding which was the better of C and D. In the last chapter sources of error and possible improvements were discussed. Here errors such as not having done a thoroughly calculation of the modulus of elasticity for the arch, taking possible cracking of the concrete into account, which could have great impact on the model were noted. The problems of working with a black box such as the NOWS was also discussed. The summation of this discussion being that if one are to do any improvements the first two considered should possibly bee the modulus of elasticity the concrete arch and finding a different simulation procedure where more controll could be obtained in how the simulation is preformed, either by writing one's own or by finding an open source approach somewhere. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{uncertainties}} {{associated with}} concrete arch dams rise {{with the increased}} height of dams. Given the uncertainties associated with influencing factors, the stability of high <b>arch</b> dam <b>abutments</b> as a fuzzy random event was studied. In addition, given the randomness and fuzziness of calculation parameters {{as well as the}} failure criterion, hazard point and hazard surface uncertainty instability risk ratio models were proposed for high <b>arch</b> dam <b>abutments</b> on the basis of credibility theory. The uncertainty instability failure criterion was derived through the analysis of the progressive instability failure process on the basis of Shannon’s entropy theory. The uncertainties associated with influencing factors were quantized by probability or possibility distribution assignments. Gaussian random theory was used to generate random realizations for influence factors with spatial variability. The uncertainty stability analysis method was proposed by combining the finite element analysis and the limit equilibrium method. The instability risk ratio was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation method and fuzzy random postprocessing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Continuous {{monitoring}} of bridges {{provides information on}} the bridge condition and permits to forecast structural deterioration.

Monitoring was conducted {{with the aid of}} a mobile monitoring unit, the main advantages of which are its repeated utilization relative simplicity of installation and suitability for any period of the bridge’s life cycle. The system consists of displacement transducers and data loggers. As a result of the year-long monitoring it was found that the vertical displacements (40 - 50 mm) in the joint were only of seasonal character. Furthermore, unsatisfactory performance of the key joint was identified. It had manifested in discrete and delayed movements of up to a few hours as compared with the joints at the <b>arch</b> <b>abutments.</b> Replacement of the joints was fitted into the major repair schedule of 2006 - 2007.

40|$|Abstract: In {{view of the}} {{randomness}} {{in terms}} of high arch dam load, resistance and failure calamity loss {{as well as the}} fuzziness in terms of evaluation conclusion, a high arch dam risk evaluation system is established by means of risk analysis method. Natural factors, structural factors and human factors that lead to high arch dam failure are summed up on the basis of statistics. Through qualitative analysis coupled with quantitative estimation, it is determined that high arch dams generally involve five major failure modes: abutment rock mass destabilization, excess cracking, arch dam & dam foundation entire destabilization, extreme dam-overflow and destabilization of dam body along base plane. The state functions of individual major failure modes are established. An approach is made to the correlativity among the major failure modes and among the random variables within individual failure modes, and it is suggested that risk rate, economic loss risk value and life loss risk value should be used to assess the risk of high arch dams.
