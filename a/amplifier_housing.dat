50|$|The Pianet M has the Pianet T {{mechanism}} {{built into}} a rectilinear wood grain console case. There is no lid over the keys. Sitting above the box that holds the playing mechanism is an <b>amplifier</b> <b>housing</b> with a sloped front face and two player facing cloth speaker grills. An acrylic music rest slots {{into the top of}} this housing. The leg panels are wood-grained boards finished with a timber foot and joined by a horizontal wood grained panel. The word 'Hohner' is printed in gold centrally above the keys. The model 'Pianet - M' is printed on the amplifier cover panel at the rear. Built in Hohner Modulator, another invention of Ernst Zacharias.|$|E
50|$|The Onix Audio/Onix Hifi and Onix Amplifiers were {{characterized}} by a minimalistic, simple, slim design, without visible screws on the casings. The <b>amplifiers</b> <b>housed</b> unusually large power supplies and were constructed using high quality components. Onix cases were always made from aluminium. They used a powder coat finish in matt black, and the front was originally in the same finish with a screen print word ONIX. In 1987, Onix changed the finish of most products to a brushed anodized finish, as well as making subtle cosmetic and electronic changes to the overall original design as the years passed.|$|R

40|$|Phased array feed (PAF) {{receivers}} used {{on radio}} astronomy telescopes offer {{the promise of}} increased fields of view while maintaining the superlative performance attained with traditional single pixel feeds (SPFs). However, the much higher noise temperatures of room temperature PAFs compared to cryogenically-cooled SPFs have prevented their general adoption. Here we describe a conceptual design for a cryogenically cooled 2. 8 2 ̆ 013 5. 18 GHz dual linear polarization PAF with estimated receiver temperature of 11 K. The cryogenic PAF receiver will comprise a 140 element Vivaldi antenna array and low-noise <b>amplifiers</b> <b>housed</b> in a 480 mm diameter cylindrical dewar covered with a RF transparent radome. A broadband two-section coaxial feed is integrated within each metal antenna element to withstand the cryogenic environment {{and to provide a}} 50 ohm impedance for connection {{to the rest of the}} receiver. The planned digital beamformer performs digitization, frequency band selection, beam forming and array covariance matrix calibration. Coupling to a 15 m offset Gregorian dual-reflector telescope, cryoPAF 4 can expect to form 18 overlapping beams increasing the field of view by a factor of 8 x compared to a single pixel receiver of equal system temperature.

5000|$|On October 17, 1953, an {{electronic}} (Maas-Rowe) symphonic-carillon was dedicated in the Ira Allen Chapel. It {{was the first}} such carillon with the capability for tuning in both major and minor tonality, and which allowed for the Carillonneur to vary the tonal coloring according to harmonic requirements. Up to this point, electronic carillons could only be tuned to one tonality, thus preventing their bells from sounding in tune at all times. [...] The device consisted of eight large speakers mounted above the bells in the tower, a console with two manuals and 64 bells {{at the base of}} the tower, and four 50 watt <b>amplifiers</b> <b>housed</b> in the basement. [...] The $5,000 instrument was presented to the University by the Interfraternity Council and dedicated to UVM students who had fallen in combat while in service to their country. However, the allotted funding for the carillon was obtained from proceeds of the ill-famed annual Kake Walk winter carnival event, a strange and [...] "culturally racist" [...] tradition which had its origins at the university during the mid-1880s (or prior). The event was officially ended on 1 November 1969. [...] The carillon was replaced in 1986.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a wideband, fully integrated, low-noise amplifier with a noise figure {{of less than}} 0. 5 dB. The device is fabricated in a 0. 35 μm GaAs enhancement-mode pHEMT process because of its positive threshold voltage and superior noise performance. The <b>amplifier</b> is <b>housed</b> in a low-cost 2 x 2 mm 2 8 -pin QFN plastic package with internal gate biasing and input and output matching. To our knowledge, this work achieved the best result of reported combination of low noise figure, OIP 3 (40 dBm), and Linearity Figure of Merit (LFOM) of 15 dB at a frequency range of 1. 5 - 2. 7 GHz for sub- 0. 5 dB NF LNA, and integrated power-down function for system control.

500|$|The initial {{models of}} Leslie {{speakers}} {{did not have}} the [...] "chorale" [...] setting. The control switch was simply a choice between [...] "off" [...] and [...] "tremolo". The first model of Leslie produced was the 30A. It emulated Hammond's DXR-20 tone cabinet, which used moving drums but only produced amplitude modulation, not frequency modulation. It contained a [...] drum and the power <b>amplifier</b> was <b>housed</b> {{in the top of the}} unit, to allow easy repair. This was superseded between 1947 and 1949 by the 31H, also known as the [...] "Tall Boy". It was similar in appearance to the 30A, but contained additional louvres along the top of the cabinet. Also, reflectors were placed on the end of the horn, to allow the treble signal to exit the unit through the sides, rather than on the top.|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} styling, the {{amplifiers}} up until 1989 are constructed of heavy aluminium extruded cases {{that act as}} heat sinks; these were painted black with a metallic silver brim - thus nicknamed [...] "chrome bumper" [...] range. The pre-amplifiers are housed in [...] "half-size" [...] {{while most of the}} power <b>amplifier</b> range was <b>housed</b> in full-size cases. In 1989, the range was given a new look using the same sturdy aluminium cases but with a new olive-coloured fascia panel which also had a back-lit logo. Another facelift for the range came in 2002. The 2013 range of Naim equipment has aluminium chassis and sleeves; the fascia is die-cast zinc.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Webber was {{a former}} band road manager whose savvy, experience, and {{connections}} with many high-profile British musicians made him the perfect choice to promote Dave Reeves premier line of amplifiers. Peter logged endless hours driving the lengths of the U.K., giving bands [...] "hands-on" [...] demos of the HIWATTS, and selling them on HIWATT's superior tonal capabilities and unmatched reliability. The bands initially trusted Peter for his reputation and knowledge, and the deals were closed once they plugged in. In particular, he would regularly take a set of Hiwatts up to a place in London called the Roundhouse, where they became the <b>house</b> <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Loudspeakers with {{integrated}} CobraNet {{help keep}} the signal chain digital for an even longer span. In a typical unpowered speaker application, the <b>amplifier</b> would be <b>housed</b> {{far away from the}} speaker, and a long speaker cable (analog) would be run between the speaker and the amplifier. The speaker cable would be subject to interference and signal loss from electrical resistance. However, a powered speaker, powered by an electrical cable and fitted with integrated CobraNet inputs, eliminates the speaker cable and replaces it with a network cable. Since a speaker will only use one audio channel out of the bundle, many speakers with CobraNet will also have a number of analog outputs {{for the rest of the}} channels in the bundle, which is useful in speaker cluster applications.|$|R
50|$|Following {{a move to}} Bar Hill, Cambridge in {{the late}} 70's, HH {{extended}} its range of sound reinforcement equipment to include models such as the MA100 Mixer Amplifier, a 100 watt, 5 channel PA amplifier 'head' with a switchable spring reverb. The IC100L, V-S Bass and the V-S Musician, a two-channel 100-watt guitar amplifier head with a spring reverb, separate gain and master volume controls and a built in switchable solid state distortion circuit. This circuit was designed to emulate valve amplifier distortion V-S for valve sound but with controllable master volume, the V-S circuit was encased in a block of resin to prevent copying by competitors. All the <b>amplifiers</b> were <b>housed</b> in smart slim carryable heads and 2 x 12 or 1 x 15 combo enclosures. Many new PA speaker cabinets were designed and put into production, such as the 212 & 412 Dual Concentric, 212BL, 215BL, 412BL, 115PA Radial Horns and Bass Bin + Piezo plus the Concert Series of pro PA systems. A large range of studio and live mixing consoles, from an 8:2 to a 24:8:2, was designed and manufactured in the early '80's, plus an HH electric piano {{and a range of}} tape echo machines and effects pedals.|$|R

50|$|Multi-amp guitar rigs use {{two or more}} {{amplifiers}} {{to create}} a unique tone {{that could not be}} achieved with the use of only one amplifier. Guitar players such as James Valentine (Maroon 5) and John Mayer use multiple amplifiers simultaneously to achieve their tones. Session guitar players such as Brent Mason often bring four or more amplifiers to recording sessions. There are many different types of guitar amplifiers that have drastically different sounds. There are three classic guitar amplifier circuits that most amplifiers are based on that all use different power amplifier tubes: The EL84 powered class A circuits which comes from the Vox AC30 and AC15 amplifiers, The 6L6 and 6V6 powered class AB circuits which come from Fender amplifiers, and the EL34 powered class AB circuits which come from Marshall amplifiers. The sonic characteristics of these different amplifier configurations are extremely different and for a lot of guitar players {{it is important to have}} the tonal palette of all three. This is especially true for studio guitarists and is why a lot of high-end recording studios have multiple different types of guitar <b>amplifiers</b> in <b>house.</b> It is a common practice to use a 6L6 or 6V6 powered amplifier for a clear, clean tone in conjunction with an EL34 or EL84 powered amplifier for a more distorted tone. It is then a matter of blending the two amps' signals in order to achieve the desired amount of distortion.|$|R
