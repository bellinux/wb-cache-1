5|$|Phase II {{would prove}} {{influential}} on The Next Generation, whose creation began just {{over seven years}} later. The characters of Xon, Decker and Ilia were {{used as the basis}} for the creation of Data, William Riker and Deanna Troi. However, the series was allowed to be different in tone to the planned Phase II, for the feature films that had come before it had changed the <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> of what Star Trek was. It was originally proposed in Gerrold's The Worlds of Star Trek to have the second-in-command leading the away team, and it was anticipated that this would be included in Phase II – it was instead first introduced in The Next Generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E

Using 400 speakers separated throughout the interior, Varèse created a sound and space installation geared towards experiencing sound as it moves through space. Received with mixed reviews, this piece challenged <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> and traditional means of composing, breathing life into electronic synthesis and presentation.|$|E

Idlebrain rated it 2.5/5, {{calling it a}} clichéd film. 123telugu rated it 3.25/5, along with stating that [...] "Shankam can be watched once as it does meet the minimum <b>audience</b> <b>expectation</b> of watching a timepass movie." ...|$|R
25|$|Defying <b>audience</b> <b>expectations,</b> as {{he often}} did, Peckinpah {{immediately}} followed The Wild Bunch with the elegiac, funny and mostly non-violent 1970 Western The Ballad of Cable Hogue. Utilizing {{many of the same}} cast (L. Q. Jones, Strother Martin) and crew members of The Wild Bunch, the film covered three years in the life of small-time entrepreneur Cable Hogue (Jason Robards) who decides to make his living by remaining in the desert after having miraculously discovered water when he had been abandoned there to die. He opens his business along a stagecoach line, only to see his dreams end with the appearance of the first automobile on the horizon. Shot on location in the Valley of Fire in Nevada, the film was plagued by poor weather, Peckinpah's renewed drinking and his brusque firing of 36 crew members. The chaotic filming wrapped 19 days over schedule and $3 million over budget, effectively terminating his tenure with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. In retrospect, it was a damaging career move as Deliverance and Jeremiah Johnson, critical and enduring box office hits, were in development at the time and Peckinpah was considered the first choice to direct both films. Largely ignored upon its initial release, The Ballad of Cable Hogue has been rediscovered in recent years and is often held up by critics as exemplary of the breadth of Peckinpah's talents. They claim that the film proves Peckinpah's ability to make unconventional and original work without resorting to explicit violence. Over the years, Peckinpah cited the film as one of his favorites.|$|E
500|$|An {{extended}} version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews. The Hollywood Reporter said that <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> were coloured by [...] "the [...] establishment skepticism that preceded Titanic" [...] and suggested the showing reflected {{the desire for}} original storytelling.

We need to start mixing things up, rather than thinking, 'This is a gay character and he'll only ever go off with men.'" ...|$|E

The film is set in rural England and challenges the <b>audiences</b> <b>expectations</b> {{of what it is}} to be elderly with the character of 86-year old Ingrid. In 2015 Green used Kickstarter to raise money for this project.|$|R
500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> had changed since then.|$|E
500|$|The {{extensive}} {{marketing campaign}} greatly increased <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> of the film. Ra.One set {{records for the}} level of pre-release buzz for a Bollywood film, and also topped a number of polls gauging the most awaited Bollywood films of the year. Anticipation for the film was equally high among the trade analysts, with some commenting that the film would pass the [...] mark in one week and the [...] mark in over three weeks. Advance bookings commenced on 20 October 2011 on a limited scale, and expanded later. While initial ticket sales were low, they picked up considerably near the release date. A few days prior to the release, the advance booking was described as [...] "phenomenal," [...] with an overall advance booking rate of 20–25% across the country. A number of advantages of the film's release were pointed out, such as the festive season and higher 3D ticket prices, though there had been doubt regarding the timely release of the 3D version.|$|E

50|$|According to {{psychologist}} and paranormal researcher Benjamin Radford, {{part of the}} reason that the story was so well-received and accepted among its American Christian audience is that it reinforced their existing narratives and beliefs.

500|$|Prior to its UK release, Spectre mostly {{received}} positive reviews. Mark Kermode, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave the film {{four out of}} five stars, observing that the film did not live up to the standard set by Skyfall, but was able to tap into <b>audience</b> <b>expectations.</b> Writing in the same publication, Peter Bradshaw gave the film a full five stars, calling it [...] "inventive, intelligent and complex", and singling out Craig's performance as the film's highlight. In another five star review, The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin described Spectre as [...] "a swaggering show of confidence'", lauding it as [...] "a feat of pure cinematic necromancy." [...] Positive yet critical assessments included Kim Newman of Sight and Sound, who wrote that [...] "for all its wayward plotting (including an unhelpful tie-in with Bond’s childhood that makes very little sense) and off-the-peg elements, Spectre works" [...] as he felt [...] "the audience’s patience gets tested by {{two and a half hours}} of set-pieces strung on one of the series’ thinner plots"; and IGN's Chris Tilly, who rated the film 7.2 out of 10, considering Spectre [...] "solid if unspectacular", and concluding that [...] "the film falls frustratingly short of greatness." ...|$|E
500|$|The Scream {{score was}} {{provided}} by fledgling composer Marco Beltrami, his first time scoring a feature film. Craven's assistant Julie Plec had requested input on composers who were [...] "new", [...] "fresh", and [...] "wonderful", and was given Beltrami's name by several people. Beltrami was contacted for samples of his work. Craven, impressed by what he heard, requested Beltrami come to the set to view the opening thirteen minutes of the film containing the introduction {{and the death of}} Barrymore's character. Beltrami was tasked with scoring a piece of music for this scene, which would be reviewed by the producers and the Weinstein brothers. Beltrami was hired to score the entire film {{on the basis of this}} sample. [...] Beltrami had no prior experience scoring a work of horror. Craven and editor Patrick Lussier advised him on how to deliver music that would raise the tension and how to use stings to punctuate the more intense moments. Craven wanted the music to intentionally raise tension during scenes where <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> were already raised by their experience of previous horror films. The volume would be raised to indicate that the killer is hiding behind a door, but nothing would be present upon its opening.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of his}} {{features}} display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the [...] "furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape" [...] in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are [...] "powerfully homoerotic", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being [...] "made up with doll-like false eyelashes", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be [...] "preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as [...] "black as coal", questioning his outlook on humanity. Although {{a few of his}} pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining [...] "the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us". Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost [...] "obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one".|$|E
50|$|Ladies {{and gentlemen}} is a salutation {{used in the}} field of entertainment, sports and theater since the mid-19th century {{vaudeville}} era. It is intended to raise the <b>audiences</b> <b>expectations</b> of a good performance and, to this end, is often followed by an announcement of the names of the performers, a description of what sort of act they are to perform, or an often hyperbolic series of accolades accorded to the act.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} “agency ” in games and other playable media (also {{referred}} to as “intention”) has been discussed as a player experience and a structural property of works. We shift focus, considering agency, instead, as a phenomenon involving both player and game, one that occurs when the actions players desire are among those they can take (and vice versa) as supported by an underlying computational model. This shifts attention away from questions such as whether agency is “free will ” (it is not) and toward questions such as how works evoke the desires agency satisfies, employ computational models {{in the service of}} player action and ongoing dramatic probability, use interfaces and mediation to encourage appropriate <b>audience</b> <b>expectation,</b> shift from initial <b>audience</b> <b>expectation</b> {{to an understanding of the}} computational model, and can be shaped with recognition of the inherently improvisational nature of agency.

5000|$|Corax is {{probably}} best known for developing the “reverse-probability argument," [...] {{also known as the}} Art of Corax. If a person is accused of a crime which he is not likely to have committed (for example, a small man physically attacking a large man, against whom he is almost certainly doomed to fail), his defense will be that {{it is unlikely that the}} crime occurred. His argument draws on the lack of means of the accused. However, if a person is accused of a crime which he is likely to have committed (in the case of a larger man attacking a smaller man), he can also use the defense that it is unlikely that he did it, for the very reason that it appears too probable. This man draws on the lack of prospect of getting away unsuspected. It works by anticipating the <b>audience’s</b> <b>expectations,</b> and then combatting that expectation with a countermove. This pattern of anticipating and then contradicting an <b>audience’s</b> <b>expectation</b> has continued to be a typical move in reverse probability arguments to this day.|$|R
500|$|Most of the B movie {{production}} houses founded {{during the}} exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field's financial situation {{changed in the}} early 1980s. Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects. Intimations of the trend were evident as early as Airport (1970) {{and especially in the}} mega-schlock of The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Earthquake (1973), and The Towering Inferno (1974). Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best; from an industry perspective, however, these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of star-stuffed extravaganzas. The Exorcist had demonstrated the drawing power of big-budget, effects-laden horror. But the tidal shift in the majors' focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films: Steven Spielberg's creature feature Jaws (1975) and George Lucas's space opera Star Wars (1977) had each, in turn, become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history. Superman, released in December 1978, had proved that a studio could spend [...] on a movie about a children's comic book character and turn a big profit—it was the top box-office hit of 1979. Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original 1933 King Kong had once been exceptional; in the new Hollywood, increasingly under the sway of multi-industrial conglomerates, they would rule.|$|E
500|$|Matt Wales of IGN {{rated the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.9 out of 10, stating {{that despite the}} episode's premise, it came [...] "perilously close to greatness," [...] and praised Raynor's [...] "crackling script which graciously walked the tightrope between balls-out farce and affectionate sci-fi pastiche". Wales noted that Tennant and Tate [...] "relished" [...] the {{perpetual}} swings from [...] "square-jawed serious" [...] to [...] "faintly sadistic subversion", to mess with <b>audience</b> <b>expectations.</b> Ryan's performance as Staal was again praised, but Wales felt Agyeman still displayed [...] "the charisma and range of a dead fish, despite Martha's transformation from lovesick sap to Ripley-esque super soldier." [...] Wales summed up that the episode [...] "did pretty much everything a two-part opener should – swiftly shifting the pieces into place for next week's inevitably bombastic showdown." [...] Alan Stanley Bear of Airlock Alpha called [...] "The Sontaran Strategem" [...] an [...] "exciting and nostalgic adventure", {{and said that the}} episode lives up to the show's reputation for transforming a normal object, in this case the car, to a [...] "global killer". Bear praised the episode for Donna and Martha's introduction being opposite to Rose Tyler and Sarah Jane Smith's in [...] "School Reunion", for providing a human element in the subplot where Donna visits her grandfather, and for the episode's cliffhanger. However, Bear wrote that it took too long to [...] "get to the point", and criticized the [...] "bland Sontaran dialogue and the cliched simplicity of mind control", which he felt [...] "reduced {{what could have been a}} fantastically intricate story piece into Saturday morning cartoon material." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy {{called the}} film's visuals vivid, stunning, and {{magnificent}} on a technical level, and praised {{the performances of}} Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, but wrote that the film [...] "caters too much to imagined <b>audience</b> <b>expectations</b> when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected destinations." [...] Time Out Londons Tom Huddleston wrote that [...] "the photography is pleasingly crisp and the design is stunning", but that, [...] "he script feels flat... the dialogue is lazy, while the plot, though crammed with striking concepts, simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy, confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum." [...] Emanuel Levy wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, [...] "is not only uneven, but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a [...] "seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract." [...] Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance [...] "continues here the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in Alien", but considered that Elba's Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does not answer them, which made the film intriguing and parallel to the [...] "classic tradition of golden age sci-fi". He later went on to name {{it as one of}} the best films of 2012.|$|E
