5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an <b>airbag</b> deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an <b>airbag</b> control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{investigates the}} <b>airbag</b> on Skinner's car, {{which was the}} one used to hit Sharon. Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the <b>airbag</b> which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E
5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as <b>airbag</b> explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E

5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS <b>airbag,</b> power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the <b>airbag</b> and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|The Blu-ray and DVD were {{released}} on October 29, 2007, in the United Kingdom, on October 31 in Hungary, November 20 in the United States, and December 12 in Australia. The DVD topped rental and sales charts in its opening week of release in the U.S. and Canada. There is an unrated version, which retains {{much of the}} original 'R-rated' dialogue, and a theatrical version of the film. However, the unrated version has a branching error resulted {{in one of the}} unrated changes to be omitted. The film briefly switches to the PG-13 version in the <b>airbag</b> scene; McClane's strong language is missing from this sequence (although international DVD releases of the unrated version are unaffected). The Blu-ray release features the PG-13 theatrical cut which runs at 128 minutes, while the Collector's Edition DVD includes both the unrated and theatrical versions. Time magazine's Richard Corliss named it one of the Top 10 DVDs of 2007, ranking it at #10.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Volvo {{installed}} a head-protecting <b>airbag,</b> {{which was made}} standard in all new models {{as well as some}} existing models. The IC head-protecting <b>airbag</b> was not available on the 1997 C70 since the initial design deployed the <b>airbag</b> from the roof, and the C70, being a convertible, could not accommodate such an <b>airbag.</b> A later version of the C70 featured a head-protecting <b>airbag</b> deploying upwards from the door, avoiding this problem. It has been stated by many testing authorities that side head protecting curtain airbags can reduce the risk of death in a side impact by up to 40% and brain injury by up to 55%, as well as protect occupants during a rollover. In 1998, Volvo introduced its Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), a safety device to prevent injury to front seat users during collisions.|$|E
25|$|A driver <b>airbag</b> was {{standard}} equipment on all V70 models, {{depending on the}} market a passenger <b>airbag</b> was either {{standard equipment}} or a no cost option.

The system is supplemented by standard side airbags incorporated into the front seats.|$|E

25|$|For the 1990 model year, changes {{included}} larger protective laminate {{in front}} of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an <b>airbag</b> and <b>airbag</b> indicator light on dash, {{there was also a}} redesign of the left side switch panel, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. Lower dash panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally the memory lever on the steering column was removed.|$|E
