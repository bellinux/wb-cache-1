25|$|After {{their worst}} season ranking in decades, Jokerit {{acquired}} {{the services of}} HIFK head coach and former NHL'er Doug Shedden. Shedden brought in a key player from HIFK, Kim Hirschovits, who had gained responsibility under Shedden in his former team. The refreshed team also featured Jyrki Louhi from the 2005–06 champions HPK and Juuso Riksman from Ässät, the second placed team of 2006. Jokerit acquired some scoring talent {{in the form of}} Tim Stapleton and some NHL-experience as Shedden's former protege from Toronto-era Clarke Wilm moved to Jokerit mid-season. Shedden's first Jokerit season was good as the team returned to the play-offs and infamously defeated the reigning champions HPK in the semi-finals to advance to the finals against Kärpät. Although Jokerit lost to Kärpät in the finals, the 2006–07 season was a good start for Shedden in Jokerit. During the 2007–08 season Jokerit celebrated their 40th anniversary and on 27 October Jokerit retired the jersey of former alumni Jari Kurri. Jokerit strengthened their goaltending department by acquiring former NHL and Finnish national team Goaltender Jussi Markkanen to replace Scott Langkow before the season and added more NHL experience by contracting former Atlanta Thrashers and Vancouver Canucks center Tommi Santala after the season had started. During the 2007–2008 SM-Liiga season, Doug Shedden announced that he had been contracted to the Swiss team EV Zug and was leaving Jokerit after the season. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>it</b> was announced that Shedden's job as the head coach of the team would be taken over by ex-NHL head coach Glen Hanlon after Shedden's contract was to expire. Shedden's last season as the head coach of Jokerit ended worse than expected. Although Jokerit were predicted to be championship contenders, they lost a 3–1 lead in the series against Espoo Blues and lost the series 3 to 4. Jokerit was dropped to the bronze medal game where they lost to Tappara, thus finishing fourth in SM-liiga for the 2007–08 season. Along with Shedden, Jokerit also lost the services of assistant coach Waltteri Immonen as he followed Shedden to EV Zug.|$|E

50|$|Assistance was {{produced}} at Playwrights Horizons in New York City, New York. It ran from February 27-March 11, 2012. New York Times theater critic Charles Isherwood criticized the production for its absence of Daniel Weisinger, {{the head of}} the company. Isherwood wrote, “Ms. Headland may intend to establish how forcefully a man (or woman) can exert psychological control over his underlings without much personal contact, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it’s</b> like watching The Devil Wears Prada with the Anna Wintour character snipped from every scene.” His main criticism of the production is that there are “no dramatic fireworks.” Isherwood still said that the cast, directed by Trip Cullman, did the best work they could with their “fairly circumscribed roles.” Michael Esper (Nick) and Virginia Kull (Nora) were the leads in the production.|$|R

2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Liu {{awarded the}} game a B, praising the {{graphics}} {{and variety of}} gameplay, but finding the game became somewhat repetitive towards the end; [...] "Dark Cloud 2 is very serial in nature. It's a game {{you can pick up}} and play for a few hours, stomping though a few dungeon floors, trying to solve a problem or two, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> meanders towards repetition.

2500|$|Richthofen's {{participation}} on {{the operation}} {{came to an}} abrupt end on 23 June 1942. Having been informed by Jeschonnek and Hitler that he was to assume command of Luftlfotte 4 after the fall of Sevastopol earlier, they decided not to wait. They ordered him to Kursk in order to take up his command, leaving his Corps behind, and Sevastopol air operations under the command of von Wild. Richthofen was disgusted. He felt it was ridiculous to move him mid-operation, and he had wanted to be there when the fortress fell. He wrote, [...] "It is a pity that one can never finish what one starts in the east. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>it</b> takes away all the pleasure".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, DoraDoraBoBora from Jay Is Games {{described}} {{the game as}} a beautiful point-and-click fantasy game that [...] "mixes puzzles and slight hidden-object hunting to create a beautiful adventure series that might not pose too great of a challenge to some players, but is still a captivating experience while it lasts. [...] Visually the game is striking, and wandering through it feels appropriately dreamlike." [...] Like Gamezebo's Erin Bell, Dora noted that The Book of Air was [...] "to {{set the stage for}} the next", and said: [...] "The Book of Air mostly just sends you from place to place solving puzzles. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>it</b> starts to feel more like a virtual tour of the world as you fly from place to place.

Production-wise, the song used some computer tricks to play with Mýa's vocals. [...] is set to be a hot track on radio and in the clubs all summer long." [...] Jacqueline Springer of NME gave the song a mixed review, writing: [...] "No-good boyfriend anthem number four thousand eighty time, y'all [...] The stuttering arrangement of the original is cool and suits Mýa's brooding mood, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> simply sits in the wind — there's no real build into a bassline leaving the track to run along a continuous pop/r vibe [...] Anyway, we all know what to do when ex-girlfriends re-emerge don't we?

2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} {{developed}} for the RNLI by J.A. MacLachlan working for naval architects G.L. Watson of Glasgow. Initially proposed with 'chines' along the hull to disperse the spray and improve stability when underway at speed, this caused a high deck above water which proved difficult when {{trying to get people}} aboard from the water, so the chines were dispensed with on the second boat and the deck curved down nearer the water. The first three boats were built with wooden hulls and were respectively , [...] and [...] long, the extra length due to a rounded transom. All differed in superstructure design, 52-01 having a raked back superstructure front with the flying bridge at the after end. 52-02 introduced forward raked wheelhouse windscreens, had a unique wheelhouse side window pattern and retained the aft mounted flying bridge. On 52-03, the flying bridge was moved to the forward end of the wheelhouse, the front of which was rounded. From 54-04, the forward flying bridge was standardised and the forward raked wheelhouse windscreens were reintroduced. The side windows were recessed from the superstructure sides. 54-04 had a Glass Reinforce Plastic hull and this was standardised for future boats. 54-04 to 54-07 retained the rounded transon but from 52-08 a square transom was reintroduced. The final external change came with 52-11 which had flush sided forward wheelhouse windows and this was a feature of all subsequent boats.In 1986 52-030 (ON 1100) became the only steel hulled Arun. It was regarded as the best of the class for seakeeping, although the slowest. The GRP hulls were moulded in blue material in the outer skin. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> was found that water was accumulating in the fibreglass which added up to 2 tons to the weight. The boats had the coloured layer stripped off and replaced by a new one made with clear gel which reduced the amount of water absorbed.|$|E
50|$|The key to {{understanding}} how love bombing differs from romantic courtship {{is to look at}} what happens next, after two people are officially a couple.

5000|$|A 2/5 {{was awarded}} by Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk, who opined that [...] "The flick {{feels like it}} wants to be a stark, dark and female-empowered shocker like High Tension, yet it fails on nearly every count. The killer is silly, the victims are stupid, the heroine is kind of a nut, and the biking starts to get on your nerves <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>It's</b> like <b>a</b> Schwinn promotional video that somehow got turned into a half-baked slasher turkey". The film {{received}} a positive critique from DVD Verdict's David Johnson, who found Blood Trails to be [...] "a well-done little movie" [...] overall, opening his review with, [...] "I was pleasantly surprised by this effective little suspense thriller.
