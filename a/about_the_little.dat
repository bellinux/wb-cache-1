500|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 1905, Potter {{sent the}} {{illustrations}} to Warne for his review, writing, [...] "I think it promises to make a pretty book." [...] He criticised {{a picture of the}} cat and Potter wrote him, [...] "If you still feel doubtful <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> cat—will you post it back to me at once ... I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I think I can get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{illustrations}} did not coordinate properly with Potter's text. She altered the drawing and wrote Warne, [...] "I {{have altered the}} oven as it will save a good many corrections. I did a good deal to the cat but she is still looking at the top one. I don't think it signifies as she talks about both ovens ... I don't think I have ever seriously considered {{the state of the}} pie but the book runs some risk of being over cooked if it goes on much longer! I am sorry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> dog's nose. I saw it was too sharp. I think I have got it right. I was intending to explain the ovens by saying the middle handle is very stiff so that Duchess concludes it is a sham;–like the lowest. I think only two pages want changing; I think it will come right." ...|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first season}} of the TV series never {{revealed}} how Henry learned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Littles,</b> as it opened with Henry telling the audience that he has [...] "a very special secret" [...] {{and is the only}} one who knows <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Littles.</b> During <b>the</b> second season, the opening says that Tom and Lucy fell inside Henry's suitcase when he moved; he discovered them when he opened his suitcase afterward. In the final season, Henry traveled to other parts of the world with his parents, using a specially designed carrier (a hollowed-out camera case) to take <b>the</b> <b>Littles</b> with him.|$|R
50|$|Henry takes {{great care}} to keep other humans, {{including}} his own parents, from learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Littles.</b> In one episode, however ("Dinky's Doomsday Pizzas"), Henry betrayed <b>the</b> <b>Littles</b> {{when he learned that}} if he did, he would be on TV. The incident, and its resulting fallout, turned out to be only a dream, specifically Dinky's dream.|$|R

2500|$|Within {{the first}} week of the strike, AMPTP-member {{companies}} fired writers' assistants, production assistants, and other lower-level staffers working on shut down programs. Writer-producer Seth MacFarlane called this a [...] "desperate, punitive act" [...] and called on [...] "all show-runners whose assistants are terminated, if you have the means, keep paying your assistants because this strike is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> guys." ...|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Joanna Rapf {{observes that}} Lumet {{had always been}} an {{independent}} director, and liked to make films about [...] "men who summon courage to challenge the system, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> guy against the system." [...] This also includes the women characters, as in Garbo Talks. Its star, Anne Bancroft embodied the kind of character portrayal that attracted him: [...] "a committed activist {{for all kinds of}} causes, who stands up for the rights of the oppressed, who is lively, outspoken, courageous, who refuses to conform for the sake of convenience, and whose understanding of life allows her to die with dignity... Garbo Talks in many ways is a valentine to New York." ...|$|E

5000|$|Besides the {{clarified}} family tree, Henry knowing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Littles</b> {{was unique}} to the television series and the movie, Here Come <b>the</b> <b>Littles.</b> <b>The</b> first season never revealed how Henry met the Littles; during the opening credits Henry simply tells the audience that he has [...] "a very special secret" [...] - {{that he is the}} only one who knows <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Littles.</b> During <b>the</b> second season, the opening credits said that Henry first met <b>the</b> <b>Littles</b> when Tom and Lucy fell inside his suitcase as he was moving, and they jumped out when he opened the suitcase. In the movie, however, Tom and Lucy still get trapped inside Henry's suitcase, but Henry does not discover <b>the</b> <b>Littles</b> until much later; he first sees Grandpa and Dinky in his uncle's yard, while Tom and Lucy later befriend him when they need his help. Henry took great care to keep the Littles' existence a secret, even from his own parents. Although he betrayed them in one episode ("Dinky's Doomsday Pizza"), the entire incident and its resulting fallout turned out to be only a dream that Dinky was having.|$|R

They had no leaves at all to cover their little naked brown limbs.|$|R
2500|$|After {{their return}} to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. In Wheatley's autobiography, Paper Paradise (1999), he {{described}} how they obtained their name: [...] "It was now {{time to get out}} of the rehearsal room and play to a live audience – somewhere without any fanfare, somewhere out of the way. I booked the Golfview Hotel in Geelong for the Saturday night of 1 March 1975. While travelling to the venue down the Geelong Road from Melbourne, we passed the turn-off for Little River. From the back of the truck, Glenn Shorrock shouted, 'What <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> River Band'? And so, that night the Golfview Hotel witnessed the first performance of the Little River Band, albeit advertised on the marquee as Mississippi." [...] On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig under their new name at Martini's Hotel in Carlton. They played a return gig at the Golfview Hotel five days later.|$|E
2500|$|Del Toro {{said that}} he {{interpreted}} The Hobbit as being set in a [...] "world that is slightly more golden at the beginning, a very innocent environment" [...] and the film would need to [...] " [...] you from a time of more purity to a darker reality throughout the film, but [...] {{in the spirit of}} the book". He perceived the main themes as loss of innocence, which he likened to the experience of England after World War I, and greed, which he said Smaug and Thorin Oakenshield represent. Bilbo Baggins reaffirms his personal morality during the story's third act as he encounters Smaug and the Dwarves' greed. He added, [...] "The humble, sort of a sturdy moral fibre that Bilbo has very much represents the idea that Tolkien had <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> English man, the average English man", and the relationship between Bilbo and Thorin would be the heart of the film. The Elves will also be less solemn.|$|E
2500|$|Zelica {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a buggy horse with her colt running freely alongside until he was weaned at around five or six months. At first, the young horse showed little promise. [...] "The only redeemable feature <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> fellow was that he was friendly and cute" [...] recalled Messner. [...] "I honestly thought the colt's future would be confined to hauling a delivery wagon." [...] However, a close friend named John Wattles, the owner of the livery stable in which Dan Patch was foaled, saw potential in the colt. Wattles received permission from Messner to train Dan Patch and gradually developed the horse's abilities. By late 1898, Messner was able to use Dan Patch as his buggy horse since Zelica was again in foal, and even hooked the horse up to his sleigh over the winter. The locals were increasingly impressed by the almost black colt, who loved to move fast but was biddable enough to pull young boys behind him on the sleigh.|$|E
