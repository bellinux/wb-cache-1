5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, {{will be able to make}} them come to terms. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E
25|$|A lattice that {{satisfies}} the first or, equivalently (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out),</b> the second axiom, {{is called a}} distributive lattice.|$|E
60|$|However, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> nothing came, after all, of the {{untoward}} incident.|$|R
25|$|In 1991, {{the band}} split up (temporarily, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out)</b> and Duffy {{subsequently}} pursued a solo career.|$|R
25|$|In {{exchange}} {{for all these}} concessions, France hoped (in vain, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out)</b> for Italian support against German aggression.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> uniform spaces, {{and more}} {{generally}} Cauchy spaces, are always preregular, so the Hausdorff condition {{in these cases}} reduces to the T0 condition.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> most {{of those}} {{predictions}} were wrong. While Justice Burton harbored fears {{at one point that}} he might be the only Justice to vote against the government's position, he was encouraged by his private conversations with other Justices. In the end, the Court voted 6–3 to affirm the District Court's injunction barring the President from seizing the steel plants.|$|E
25|$|Most {{prominent}} {{minister of}} foreign affairs during his reign was Nikola Pašić. At the beginning of Peter's reign he opposed the new king, calling his {{ascension to the throne}} unlawful. However, he quickly changed his mind after seeing that Serbian people accepted King Peter. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> only conflict he had with Peter during his 18-year reign was the king's salary.|$|E
50|$|Vince Gibson {{entered as}} the first {{head coach of the}} Night. He was also the final coach <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{event has}} {{particular}} significance <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be James Brown's final televised recording, as {{he died on}} 25 December 2006.|$|R
60|$|Angut and Simek {{had time}} to lift their kayaks on to the ice, but that, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> was of no advantage.|$|R
25|$|The hall {{originally}} seated 2,901. The cantilevered {{boxes are}} {{often described as}} looking like drawers pulled out in a hurried burglary, but none has a compromised sightline. The ceiling was wilfully sculptural, a conceit at {{the very edge of}} building technology and, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> way beyond the contemporary understanding of acoustics. Robin Day, who designed the furniture for the auditorium, used a clearly articulated structure in his designs of bent plywood and steel.|$|E
25|$|Another paradox due to {{mathematical}} idealization is D'Alembert's {{paradox of}} fluid mechanics. When the forces associated with two-dimensional, incompressible, irrotational, inviscid steady flow across a body are calculated, {{there is no}} drag. This is in contradiction with observations of such flows, but <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> a fluid that rigorously satisfies all the conditions is a physical impossibility. The mathematical model breaks down at {{the surface of the}} body, and new solutions involving boundary layers have to be considered to correctly model the drag effects.|$|E
25|$|Perturbation {{theory is}} an {{important}} tool for describing real quantum systems, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> {{to be very difficult}} to find exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for Hamiltonians of even moderate complexity. The Hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions, such as the hydrogen atom, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, are too idealized to adequately describe most systems. Using perturbation theory, we can use the known solutions of these simple Hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated systems.|$|E
25|$|Upon examination, however, {{superintendent}} Joseph Littlejohn admitted never finding any Communists. Labor spying, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> {{was merely}} {{an excuse to}} wreck unions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> Mary {{was not in}} {{the least}} to blame --it was all her father's fault--at least his and old Darley's." ...|$|R
50|$|Grady {{was chosen}} as the pending {{railroad}} depot for the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (ATSF), but <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> Grady was by-passed.|$|R
25|$|Unseen, Jim {{manages to}} sneak into the pirates' fortress, {{overpower}} them with a trick and some luck, and become their leader. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> Jim is the last descendant of Caspar, the third of the Three Kings, whose heirs were doomed to remain homeless after Mrs. Grindtooth had sunk their kingdom beneath the ocean millennia ago. Only the sinking of Castle Stormeye will raise {{it back to the}} surface. In the end, the Wild 13 sacrifice their fortress, Jim's old kingdom reappears – and to everyone's surprise, Morrowland is located {{at the top of the}} realm's highest mountain.|$|E
25|$|Matt {{had also}} {{wondered}} why people were chasing {{him and the}} unknown female character, but it all {{ends up in the}} Chicago area in the game. One morning, somebody took the keys from Matt's car that the unknown female character got him, and stole the car. Matt has to follow the person and had to follow the driver. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> the driver that took the keys, was the unknown female character in his perspective. She later gives a case to somebody that knows her, and Matt is forced to leave the area without her.|$|E
25|$|The late season run {{also was}} very {{beneficial}} to the team's bottom line, the team started the year with only 123 season-ticket holders were on track to lose $500,000 that season, they managed to lessen that to $300,000. Their average attendance was 7,200, but that number was largely made up of complementary tickets. Their late season run though included three consecutive 9,000+ crowds of which all were paid tickets, and thus ownership was highly optimistic heading into their second season. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> this was actually the club's most successful season financially, {{that is to say}} it's the least money they lost in one season.|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{did this}} {{at the request of}} the army, as a {{demonstration}} while they attacked. They did not, however, make the attack, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1888, Vail retired, {{temporarily}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> {{and devoted}} {{his time to}} travel and adventure in South America, and promoting {{the use of the}} telephone abroad.|$|R
60|$|You couldn't exactly {{describe}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a picnic, could you? But I don't suppose {{any of us}} knew {{it would}} be such a tough job <b>as</b> <b>it's</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
25|$|In July 2008, an Israir Airlines {{aircraft}} {{flew from}} Eilat Airport to Ben Gurion International Airport {{with a small}} hole in its frame. The hole was discovered by mechanics at Ben Gurion {{and there is an}} ongoing probe {{as to whether or not}} Israir knew of the hole, which, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> was caused by Israir workers in Eilat when they crashed a mobile staircase into the aircraft's body. The plane was scheduled to fly to Italy from Tel Aviv, and at an altitude of over 10,000 meters, the plane would most likely have experienced a decompression, possibly explosive, and could have resulted in injuries or fatalities.|$|E
25|$|In December 2004, Big Finish {{released}} , {{the first}} audio drama in a UNIT spin-off series, {{which features a}} retired General Sir Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart as an advisor {{to a new generation}} of officers. A preview episode (given away free with Doctor Who Magazine #351, and later available as a free download on the Big Finish website), , has Lethbridge-Stewart finally breaking decades of secrecy by informing a press conference of UNIT's true purpose as humanity's first line of defence against the unknown (although, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> the general public believe this to be a hoax). The series also introduced another rival division, this time within the British government, the Internal Counter-Intelligence Service, or ICIS.|$|E
25|$|Well into 1944, {{with the}} Confederate cause all but lost, Featherston {{attempts}} {{to flee the}} more populous northern areas with many core Freedom Party and CSA officials, including General Potter. He wants to lead them into the woods {{so that they could}} begin guerrilla action against the U.S., making occupation too hazardous for the United States forces to attempt. Ultimately, his plan was defeated by a guerrilla fighter named Cassius (son of Scipio/Xerxes), who finds the bedraggled party by chance and promptly shoots Featherston dead after recognizing his voice from frequent wireless broadcast. Upon his death, his vice president, Donald Partridge, quickly moves to end the war, and <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> the Confederate States' existence as a nation, by surrendering to U.S. forces.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, King played singles {{only half}} the year, as she retired (temporarily, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out)</b> from tournament singles {{competition}} immediately after winning her sixth Wimbledon singles title.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, {{after he}} had retired from business, Hudnut's stepdaughter, Natacha Rambova, married Rudolph Valentino, who, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> had not {{completed}} his divorce from his first wife.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> no {{contract}} {{had been}} signed and after {{five days in}} Yaoundé the player left, despite earlier promising to win the national championship with the club.|$|R
25|$|With Li Xu Nan in Bond's debt, Bond uses Li's {{contacts}} {{to go to}} Australia {{to investigate}} EurAsia Enterprises and find a link {{between it and the}} nuclear blast. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> Thackeray is very much alive and has been mining unreported uranium in Australia to make his own nuclear bomb, which he plans to detonate in Hong Kong at the moment the handover takes place in retaliation for his loss of his family's legacy. Returning to Hong Kong, Bond, Li Xu Nan, and a Captain with the Royal Navy track down Thackeray's nuclear bomb and defuse it. The battle claims the lives of Li Xu Nan as well as Thackeray's, who is drowned by Bond in the harbour.|$|E
25|$|Cortisone {{was first}} {{identified}} by the American chemists Edward Calvin Kendall and Harold L. Mason while researching at the Mayo Clinic. In 1929, Philip S. Hench and colleagues discovered that cortisone is effective {{in the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis. Kendall was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine along with Philip S. Hench and Tadeus Reichstein for the discovery of adrenal cortex hormones, their structures, and their functions. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> both Reichstein and the team of O. Wintersteiner and J. Pfiffner had separately isolated the compound prior to Mason and Kendall, but failed to recognize its biological significance. Mason's contributions to the crystallization and characterization of the compound have generally been forgotten outside of the Mayo Clinic.|$|E
25|$|The game {{opened up}} with a bang for the Hawkeyes, as C.J. Jones took the opening kickoff 100-yards for the touchdown. But <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> {{it would be the}} only time until late in the fourth quarter that the Hawkeyes would see the endzone. Although the game was tied at halftime, USC blocked Iowa's last-second field goal, {{preventing}} a possible Iowa lead at the half. From there, Heisman winner Carson Palmer went to work. The senior quarterback threw for over 300 yards against the Big Ten's worst passing defense and led scoring drives of 79, 80, 99, 85 and 61 yards as the Trojans held a 16-minute advantage in time of possession. The USC defense was suffocating and Iowa's miscues were proof. The Hawkeyes had two turnovers, 13 penalties, and multiple missed opportunities.|$|E
50|$|Her second {{fight was}} her first, and, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> only {{professional}} fight in Canada. She defeated Karen Wilson on December 12, 1996, by a four-round decision in Vancouver.|$|R
6000|$|Well, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> this {{charcoal}} burner {{was just the}} twin of the Southern [...] "poor white" [...] of the far future. The king presently showed impatience, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{worked up}} into a very telling and pathetic history for Constance's sympathizing ears on Sunday, {{especially}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> {{to be one of}} the things not reported to mamma.|$|R
