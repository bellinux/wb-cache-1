Douglas MacMillan of Business Week noted that the Obama transition site Change.gov [...] "won praise for its clean look and Citizen's Briefing Book feature".

2500|$|Conductors responded {{diversely}} to Gould and {{his playing}} habits. George Szell, who led Gould in 1957 with the Cleveland Orchestra, remarked to his assistant, [...] "That nut's a genius." [...] Leonard Bernstein said, [...] "There is nobody quite like him, and I just love playing with him." [...] Bernstein created a stir at the concert of April 6, 1962 when, {{just before the}} New York Philharmonic was to perform the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor with Gould as soloist, he informed the audience that he was assuming no responsibility for what they were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> He asked the audience: [...] "In a concerto, who is the bossthe soloist or the conductor? (audience laughter). The answer is, of course, sometimes the one and sometimes the other, depending on the people involved." [...] Specifically, {{he was referring to}} their rehearsals with Gould's insistence that the entire first movement be played at half the indicated tempo. The speech was interpreted by Harold C. Schonberg, music critic for The New York Times, as an abdication of responsibility and an attack on Gould. Plans for a studio recording of the performance came to nothing. The live radio broadcast (along with Bernstein's disclaimer) was subsequently released on CD.|$|E

60|$|My English feelings, however, {{were too}} many for my French education, and I made, I believe, a very pitiful figure, when Miss Vernon, seating herself majestically in a huge elbow-chair in the library, like a judge <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a cause of importance, signed to {{me to take a}} chair {{opposite}} to her (which I did, much like the poor fellow {{who is going to be}} tried), and entered upon conversation in a tone of bitter irony.|$|E

60|$|A {{fortnight}} {{after the}} receipt of Miss Starbrow's letter, one afternoon the girls came in from their walk, and Constance, seeing her mother {{at work in the}} dining-room, remained standing at the door until Fan went upstairs. Then she went inside and sat down near her mother. Mrs. Churton glanced at her with a swift startled glance, then bent her eyes on her work again. But her heart fluttered in her breast, for she knew that she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> some new and perhaps painful thing.|$|E
60|$|But {{two things}} {{encouraged}} and invigorated her: he was alive, {{and he had}} written to her.

Wherewith he waved forward Miss Arthuret, a slight, youthful-looking lady, fashionably attired, and made his escape with rapid foot and hasty nods, almost furtively, while the audience were clapping her.|$|E

6000|$|It chanced {{that his}} way lay up the Rue Drouot and thence up the Rue des Martyrs; and chance, in this case, served {{him better than}} all the forethought in the world. For on the outer {{boulevard}} he saw two men in earnest colloquy upon a seat. One was dark, young, and handsome, secularly dressed, but with an indelible clerical stamp; the other answered in every particular to the description given him by the clerk. Francis felt his heart beat high in his bosom; {{he knew he was}} now <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the voice of his father; and making a wide circuit, he noiselessly took his place behind the couple in question, who were too much interested in their talk to observe much else.

60|$|I cannot {{make out}} that I was any the less fond of Dickens because of it. I believe I was rather {{more willing to}} accept it as a {{faithful}} portraiture then than I should be now; and I certainly never made any question of it with my friend the organ-builder. 'Martin Chuzzlewit' was a favorite book with him, {{and so was the}} 'Old Curiosity Shop.' No doubt a fancied affinity with Tom Pinch through their common love of music made him like that most sentimental and improbable personage, whom he would have disowned and laughed to scorn if he had met him in life; but it was a purely altruistic sympathy that he felt with Little Nell and her grandfather. He was fond of reading the pathetic passages from both books, and I can still hear his rich, vibrant voice as it lingered in tremulous emotion on the periods he loved. He would catch the volume up anywhere, any time, and begin to read, at the book-store, or the harness- shop, or the law-office, it did not matter in the wide leisure of a country village, in those days before the war, when people had all the time there was; and he was sure of his audience as long as he chose to read. One Christmas eve, in answer to a general wish, he read the 'Christmas Carol' in the Court-house, and people came from all <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Now here again, in {{the third}} place, we find a rainbow, a rainbow round about the throne; round about the throne of grace. A rainbow--that is, a token of the {{covenant}}, a token of the covenant of grace in its lastingness; and that token is {{the appearance of the}} man Christ. The appearance--that is, his robes, his righteousness, 'from the appearance of his loins even upward,' and 'from the appearance of his loins even downward' (Eze 1:27); even down to the foot, as you have it in the book of the Revelation (1:13). 'As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord' (Eze 1:28). The sum then is, that by the rainbow round about the throne of grace upon which God sitteth to hear and answer the petitions of his people, we are to understand the obedential righteousness of Jesus Christ, which in the days of his flesh he wrought out and accomplished for his people; by which God's justice is satisfied, and their person justified, and they so made acceptable to him. This righteousness, that shines in God's eyes more glorious than the rainbow in the cloud doth in ours, saith John, is round about the throne. But for what purpose? Why, to be looked upon. But who must look upon it? Why, God and his people; the people when they come to pray, and God when he is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> and give. 'And the bow shall be in the cloud'; says God, 'and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth' (Gen 9:16). And, I say, as the bow is for God to look on, so it is also for our sight to behold. A rainbow round about the throne, in sight; in whose sight? in John's and his companions, like unto an emerald.|$|E
