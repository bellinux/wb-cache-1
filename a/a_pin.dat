5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or <b>a</b> <b>pin,</b> and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was a folding game board with a cloth and cardboard pocket attached {{to the bottom of the}} game board along its edge. In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> and plate teetotum.|$|E

5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only feels like <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> prick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects {{can range from}} {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} for the World Heavyweight Championship in which Chris Benoit defended the championship against Kane. Benoit started the match by delivering chops to Kane. Mid-way in the match, Benoit charged towards Kane, but Kane delivered a sidewalk slam and tossed him over the top rope to the arena floor. Kane then {{stepped out of the}} ring and grabbed Benoit to launch him into the ring post, but Benoit was able to reverse Kane's attack, and slammed him into the ring post. After blocking a Crippler crossface attempt, Kane chokeslammed Benoit for a near-fall. The match concluded when Kane attempted a flying clothesline but Benoit countered it with the Crippler crossface, which Kane fought out of. Benoit rolled Kane up in <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> to retain the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match, Cesaro {{defeated}} Sami Zayn. In {{the first half}} of the match, Zayn dove through the ropes looking for a tornado DDT, only for Cesaro to intercept with a European uppercut. Cesaro went on to target Zayn's left knee. In the second half of the match, Cesaro attempted to superplex Zayn from the apron into the ring, but Zayn countered and tried to perform a frankensteiner to Cesaro. Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn then hit his signature Helluva Kick to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to stay down, but Zayn kept getting up to receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature Neutralizer, but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro then hit a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the Neutralizer on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn.|$|E

5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311‚Äì1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271‚Äì1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E
5|$|Monster's Ball II {{was held}} at Bound for Glory. Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match. James Mitchell {{accompanied}} Abyss to the ring. In a Monster's Ball match, pinfalls and submissions count anywhere. There are no disqualifications or count-outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed. It is called Monster's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked {{in a dark room}} for the preceding 24 hours without food or water. In the very beginning, Sabu started bleeding from his right eye, while Hardy had blood coming out of a cut on his arm. Midway through the bout, Rhino also started to bleed. Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended {{to the top of the}} Bound for Glory set. He then jumped off in a somersault and landed on Abyss. Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered, leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver. Afterwards, Rhino drove Hardy's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds. After this match, Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten-Man Gauntlet match would be held later in the show to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards by credit card without entering <b>a</b> <b>PIN</b> or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.|$|E

5|$|On the November 29 {{episode of}} Raw, both Edge and Benoit competed {{in a number}} one contender's battle royal, but they {{eliminated}} each other simultaneously {{at the conclusion of}} the match, resulting in a draw. As a result, Triple H was forced to defend the title in a triple threat match. In the match, Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Edge, who shifted his weight putting Benoit's shoulders on the mat for <b>a</b> <b>pin.</b> This match also ended in a draw for Benoit and Edge, as Benoit made Edge submit at the same time the referee counted a pinfall for Edge. As a result, the World Heavyweight title was vacated the following week on Raw. In January 2005, Edge competed in his first Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Shawn Michaels (acting as special guest referee) performed a superkick on Edge, in retaliation for an accidental spear by Edge, causing Edge to be the first eliminated. This led to a match at the Royal Rumble later in the month, in which Edge defeated Michaels.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E
5|$|The John W.
