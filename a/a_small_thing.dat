500|$|Amongst {{the first}} critics asked to {{evaluate}} the work, Alexis Roland-Manuel showed greater understanding. [...] He acknowledged the attentive effort required of the listener was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing</b> {{in light of the}} merits of the score: [...] "It is known that the Japanese craftsman is the stingiest of his talent in the world. [...] He does not break the silence except at long intervals and speaks but few words to us each time. [...] But each of these words is full of meaning; but from each of their syllables the doors of the dream swing away for us." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Kulikovsky {{was sent to the}} front with his regiment. Michael was recalled from abroad, and Olga went to work in a military hospital as a nurse. Olga continued to press the Tsar to allow her divorce. In a letter she wrote, [...] "...finish with the divorce now during the war while all eyes and minds are occupied elsewhere—and such <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing</b> would be lost in all the greater things". The war went badly for the Russian imperial forces, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, advanced into Russia. Fearful for Kulikovsky's safety, Olga pleaded with the Tsar to transfer him to the relative safety of Kiev, where she was stationed at a hospital. In 1916, after visiting her in Kiev, the Tsar officially annulled her marriage to Duke Peter, and she married Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916, in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. Only the officiating priest, Olga's mother the Dowager Empress Marie, Olga's brother-in-law Grand Duke Alexander, two fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment, of which Olga was honorary colonel, attended. Their two-week honeymoon was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had belonged to family friends of the Kulikovskys. After visiting Kulikovsky's parents and grandmother in Kharkov, Olga and Kulikovsky returned to Kiev.|$|E
500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing</b> in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as sure as time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis. [...] Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known." ...|$|E

2500|$|The serial was {{released}} on Blu-ray Disc in July 2013. Due to the serial being shot entirely on film, {{this is the only}} Doctor Who story from the classic series where a complete high-definition release (with no upconversion) is feasible. Reviewing this release, Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian praised the film look of Spearhead From Space, claiming, [...] "It sounds like <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing</b> but it made an incredible difference; this {{is the only one of}} the vintage stories to have the picture quality worthy of a HD transfer. The Blu-ray looks superb, as if they shot a (very) low-budget Doctor Who movie late in 1969, which is pretty much what they did. The sets look sturdier, more colourful and far better than their usual overlit, studio-bound video camerawork." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} edition of Kinder- und Hausmärchen by the Brothers Grimm, the Anhang (appendix) entry to No. 71 Princess Mouse-skin {{included}} a note: [...] "as the father here, so asks King Lear his daughter". The English translation of this story by Oliver Loo begins as follows: [...] "A king had three daughters; thereon he wanted to know, which loved him most, let them come {{in front of him and}} asked them. The eldest spoke, she loved him more, than the whole kingdom; the second, more than all the precious stones and pearls in the world; but the third said, she loved him more than salt. The king was so upset, that she compared her love of him with such <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing,</b> gave her to a servant and commanded, he should take her into the forest and kill her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Antonio was {{probably}} from Teramo, in northern Abruzzo (Kingdom of Naples), {{not far from}} the Adriatic coast. [...] The possibility that we were conflating two different composers, [...] "Antonio da Teramo" [...] and [...] "Zacara da Teramo", into one person was removed by research into the composer's life by Agostino Ziino. (Another composer with a similar name, Nicolaus Zacharie, was of the following generation of composers). Antonio's nickname [...] "Zaccara" [...] (or [...] "Zachara"; often regularized in modern editions as [...] "Zacara") probably is a reference to his short stature (he is described as [...] "fuit statura corporis parva" [...] in a 15th-century biography). The name Zacara means <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing</b> of a thing of little value; hence the reason why Antonio never used the nickname himself and documents produced in circles close to the composer are careful to call him some variation on [...] "Antonius vulgatus dictus Zachara" [...] (Anthony, commonly called Zacara).|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hanina deduced from [...] that {{everything}} is in the hand of Heaven except the fear of Heaven, for [...] says: [...] "What does the Lord your God ask of you, but only to fear the Lord your God." [...] The Gemara asked whether the fear of Heaven was such a little thing that [...] says [...] "only." [...] Rabbi Hanina said in the name Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that God has in God's treasury nothing but a store {{of the fear of}} Heaven, as [...] says: [...] "The fear of the Lord is His treasure," [...] and thus the fear of Heaven must be a great thing. The Gemara responded that for Moses, the fear of Heaven was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing,</b> for he had it. Rabbi Hanina illustrated with a parable: If a man is asked for a big article and he has it, it seems like a small article to him; if he is asked for a small article and he does not have it, it seems like a big article to him.|$|E

"It {{does not}} become anyone to drop a word of doubt here and there that shall work like poison in other minds, shaking their {{confidence}} in the messages which God has given, which have aided in laying the foundation of this work, and have attended it to the present day, in reproofs, warnings, corrections, and encouragements. To all who have {{stood in the way}} of the Testimonies, I would say, God has given a message to His people, and His voice will be heard, whether you hear or forbear. Your opposition has not hindered me; but you must give an account to the God of heaven, who has sent these warnings and instructions to keep His people in the right way. You will have to answer to Him for your blindness, for being a stumbling block in the way of sinners." [...] "I saw the state of some who stood on present truth, but disregarded the visions,--the way God had chosen to teach in some cases, those who erred from Bible truth. I saw that in striking against the visions they did not strike against the worm--the feeble instrument that God spake through--but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>thing</b> to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose to show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until they would find it out too late." ...|$|E
