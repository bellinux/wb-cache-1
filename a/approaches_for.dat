5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible <b>approaches</b> <b>for</b> dealing with the Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken {{to do away with}} it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
