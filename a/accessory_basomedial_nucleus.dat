50|$|The pallial {{amygdala}} contains {{mainly the}} so-called basolateral amygdala, encompassing the lateral, basolateral (basal) and <b>basomedial</b> (<b>accessory</b> basal) <b>nuclei,</b> plus the anterior, amygdalopiriform and posterolateral corticoid areas at its surface. The medial pallium also {{may contribute to}} the pallial amygdala, forming the amygdalohippocampal nucleus and the posteromedial corticoid area. It has been postulated that the neurons forming the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract derive from the dorsal pallium and migrate tangentially into its final position caudal to the olfactory tuberculum. Situated ventral to the pallium in the basic vertebrate forebrain plan (though representing a topologically rostral field in neural plate fate maps) is another region of telencephalic gray matter known as the subpallium, which is the progenitor area for the basal ganglia, a set of structures that {{play a crucial role in}} the executive control of behavior. The subpallium region has distinct striatal, pallidal, diagonal and preoptic subregions, which are stretched obliquely between the septal midline and the amygdala at the posterior pole of the telencephalon. At least the striatum, pallidum and diagonal domains extend into the amygdala, representing there the subpallial amygdala, forming its central and medial nucleis, as well as the amygdaloid end of the bed nucleus stria terminalis complex.|$|R
50|$|Stimulation of the {{basolateral nucleus}} causes a {{reduction}} in feeding, and stimulation of the basolateral nuclear group causes an increase in arousal and attention.

40|$|The lateral amygdaloid (LA) nucleus is {{the main}} input station of the {{amygdala}} for sensory afferents. However, {{it is unclear how}} the lateral nucleus transforms these inputs, because its intrinsic connectivity is poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of the fact that glutamatergic neurons of the lateral nucleus send a primarily unidirectional projection to the <b>basomedial</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Consequently, it was possible to infer the targets of their intranuclear axons (projection cells vs inhibitory interneurons) by backfiring some projection neurons from the <b>basomedial</b> <b>nucleus</b> and analyzing evoked responses in other LA projection cells. Basomedial stimuli evoked markedly different synaptic responses depending on the orientation of the slices. In coronal slices (intact and decorticated), the prevalent response of LA neurons was an inhibition, regardless of the stimulation intensity. This inhibition was sensitive to GABAA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists, suggesting that it was mediated by the activation of GABAergic cells of the LA. In contrast, basomedial stimuli primarily evoked EPSPs in horizontal slices, regardless of the position of recorded neurons. In light of these findings, we conclude that the prevalent target of the intrinsic axon collaterals of projection cells depend on the rostrocaudal position of target neurons with respect to the parent cell body: inhibitory interneurons at rostrocaudal proximity versus other projection cells at a distance. Thus, feedback interneurons effectively divide the lateral nucleus in transverse processing modules that prevent runaway excitation within each module but allow intermixing of sensory information in the rostrocaudal plane.

40|$|So far, {{there is}} no report for the direct {{connection}} between hippocampus and amygdala. However, from the previous kindling studies, {{it was suggested that}} the hippocampus might be closely connected to the amygdala. The present study reexamined the neural connectivity between the hippocampal formation and amygdaloid complex in rat by using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde labeling method. HRP was injected iontophoretically (anodal current, 5 μA, 5 - 10 min) into the dorsal hippocampus, the ventral hippocampus and the amygdaloid nuclei under the pentobarbital anesthesia. In the case of HRP injection into the amygdala (especially into the basolateral and <b>basomedial</b> amygdaloid <b>nucleus),</b> a few HRP labeled cells were observed in the subiculum and CA 1 areas of the ventral hippocampus. Also the labeled cells were found in the amygdaloid <b>nuclei</b> (<b>basomedial</b> amygdaloid <b>nucleus</b> and amygdalo-hippocampal area) after the HRP injection into the ventral hippocampus, but not in the case into the dorsal hippocampus, as well as many lebeled cells in the entorhinal cortex. These results suggest that the ventral hippocampus and amygdala have direct connections reciprocally through the subiculum and CA 1 areas, as well as indirect connection through the same areas of the entorhinal cortex...|$|R
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} implicates the amygdala in Pavlovian fear conditioning. In this study, we examined the contribution of individual amygdaloid nuclei to contextual and auditory fear conditioning in rats. Prior to fear conditioning, rats received a large electrolytic lesion of the amygdala in one hemisphere, and a nucleus-specific neurotoxic lesion in the contralateral hemisphere. Neurotoxic lesions targeted either the lateral nucleus (LA), basolateral and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nuclei</b> (basal nuclei), or central nucleus (CE) of the amygdala. LA and CE lesions attenuated freezing to both contextual and auditory conditional stimuli (CSs). Lesions of the basal nuclei produced deficits in contextual and auditory fear conditioning only when the damage extended into the anterior divisions of the basal nuclei; damage limited to the posterior divisions of the basal nuclei did not significantly impair conditioning to either auditory or contextual CS. These effects were typically not lateralized, although neurotoxic lesions of the posterior divisions of the basal nuclei had greater effects on contextual fear conditioning when the contralateral electrolytic lesion {{was placed in the}} right hemisphere. These results indicate that there is significant overlap within the amygdala in the neural pathways mediating fear conditioning to contextual and acoustic CS, and that these forms of learning are not anatomically dissociable at the level of amygdaloid nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The amygdaloid {{complex is}} a group of nuclei that are thought to {{originate}} from multiple sites of the dorsal and ventral telencephalic neuroepithelium. The mechanisms that regulate their development are essentially unknown. We studied the role of Pax 6 and Emx 2, two transcription factors that regulate regional specification and growth of the telencephalon, in the morphogenesis of the amygdaloid complex. We used a set of specific marker genes that identify distinct amygdaloid nuclei to analyze Pax 6 /Small eye and Emx 2 knock-out mutant mouse brains. We found that there is a selective requirement for Pax 6, but not Emx 2, in the formation a subset of nuclei within the amygdaloid complex. Specifically, structures that were not previously considered to be developmentally linked, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract and the lateral, basolateral, and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nuclei,</b> all appear to have a common requirement for Pax 6. Together, our findings provide new insights into the origins and mechanisms underlying the development of the amygdaloid complex...|$|R
40|$|The connectomes {{of nervous}} systems or parts there of are {{becoming}} important subjects of study {{as the amount}} of connectivity data increases. Because most tract-tracing stud-ies are performed on the rat, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the amygdala connectome of this species resulting in a meta-study. The data were imported into the neuroVIISAS system, where regions of the connectome are organized in a controlled ontol-ogy and network analysis can be performed. A weighted digraph represents the bilateral intrinsic (connections of regions of the amygdala) and extrinsic (connections of regions of the amygdala to non-amygdaloid regions) connectome of the amygdala. Its structure as well as its local and global network parameters depend on the arrangement of neuronal entities in the ontology. The intrinsic amygdala connectome is a small-world and scale-free network. The anterior cortical nucleus (72 in- and out-going edges), the posterior nucleus (45), and the anterior <b>basomedial</b> <b>nucleus</b> (44) are the nuclear regions that posses most in- and outdegrees. The posterior nucleus {{turns out to be the}} most important nucleus of the intrinsic amygdala network since its Shapley rate is minimal.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of the amygdaloid complex of a marsupial, the opossum Didelphis aurita, was analyzed using classical stains like Nissl staining and myelin (Gallyas) staining, and enzyme histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase and NADPH-diaphorase. Most of the subdivisions of the amygdaloid complex described in eutherian mammals were identified in the opossum brain. NADPH-diaphorase revealed reactivity in the neuropil of nearly all amygdaloid subdivisions with different intensities, allowing {{the identification of the}} medial and lateral subdivisions of the cortical posterior nucleus and the lateral subdivision of the lateral nucleus. The lateral, central, basolateral and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nuclei</b> exhibited acetylcholinesterase positivity, which provided a useful chemoarchitectural criterion for the identification of the anterior basolateral nucleus. Myelin stain allowed the identification of the medial subdivision of the lateral nucleus, and resulted in intense staining of the medial subdivisions of the central nucleus. The medial, posterior, and cortical nuclei, as well as the amygdalopiriform area did not exhibit positivity for myelin staining. On the basis of cyto- and chemoarchitectural criteria, the present study highlights that the opossum amygdaloid complex shares similarities with that of other species, thus supporting the idea that the organization of the amygdala is part of a basic plan conserved through mammalian evolution.

40|$|Introduction Morphological {{features}} and morphometric parameters of galanin (GAL) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) immunoreactive neurons and neuronal fibres were studied in all nuclei of adult male rat amygdala. Material and methods After perfusion and fixation, rat brains were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against GAL and VIP and then visualized by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Results and Discussion The {{greatest number of}} galanin-immunoreactive neurons were identified in the medial part of the central nucleus and in the dorsal part of the medial nucleus. In the first case, most neurons were bipolar (37 %), and in the second, they were ovoid (45 %). GAL-immunoreactive fibers were identified in the medial nucleus, "bed nucleus" of the accessory olfactory tract, frontal cortical nucleus, amygdalo-hippocampal area and basolateral nucleus. VIP-immunoreactive neurons were diffusely distributed in more nuclei than the previous, mostly in the lateral, basolateral, and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nucleus.</b> They were mostly ovoid (40 %). VIP-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the lateral part of the central nucleus, while long and radially oriented fibers {{were present in the}} frontal and dorsal cortical nucleus. Conclusion By distribution analysis of GAL and VIP immunoreactive neurons and fibers, and according to literature data, it can be assumed that the medial part of the central nucleus receives VIP fibers {{from other parts of the}} amygdaloid body, and then sends GAL fibers to the medial nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The human {{amygdala}} {{consists of}} subdivisions contributing to various functions. However, principles of structural organization at the cellular and molecular level {{are not well}} understood. Thus, we re-analyzed the cytoarchitecture of the amygdala and generated cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of ten subdivisions in stereotaxic space based on novel workflows and mapping tools. This parcellation was then used {{as a basis for}} analyzing the receptor expression for 15 receptor types. Receptor fingerprints, i. e., the characteristic balance between densities of all receptor types, were generated in each subdivision to comprehensively visualize differences and similarities in receptor architecture between the subdivisions. Fingerprints of the central and medial nuclei and the anterior amygdaloid area were highly similar. Fingerprints of the lateral, basolateral and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nuclei</b> were also similar to each other, while those of the remaining nuclei were distinct in shape. Similarities were further investigated by a hierarchical cluster analysis: a two-cluster solution subdivided the phylogenetically older part (central, medial nuclei, anterior amygdaloid area) from the remaining parts of the amygdala. A more fine-grained three-cluster solution replicated our previous parcellation including a laterobasal, superficial and centromedial group. Furthermore, it helped to better characterize the paralaminar nucleus with a molecular organization in-between the laterobasal and the superficial group. The multimodal cyto- and receptor-architectonic analysis of the human amygdala provides new insights into its microstructural organization, intersubject variability, localization in stereotaxic space and principles of receptor-based neurochemical differences...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{considerable}} {{interest has}} been aroused by the specific actions of bisphenol A (BPA). The present investigation represents a first study {{dealing with the}} interaction of BPA with the biologically more active somatostatin receptor subtype (sst 2) in the rat limbic circuit. After treating pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats with two doses (400 µg/kg/day; 40 µg/kg/day) of BPA, the binding activity of the above receptor subtype was evaluated in some limbic regions of the offspring. The higher dose {{proved to be the}} more effective one, as demonstrated by the elevated affinity of sst 2 with its specific radioligand, [125 I]-Tyr 0 somatostatin- 14. The most dramatic effects of BPA on sst 2 levels occurred at the low-affinity states of such a subtype in some telencephalic limbic areas of postnatal rats (10 days of age; postnatal day [PND] 10). These included lower (p < 0. 05) sst 2 levels in the gyrus dentate of the hippocampus and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala; significantly higher (p < 0. 01) levels were observed only for the high-affinity states of the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. A similar trend was maintained in PND 23 rats with the exception of much lower levels of the high-affinity sst 2 receptor subtype in the amygdala nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. However, greater changes produced by this environmental estrogen were reported when the binding activity of sst 2 was checked i...|$|R
40|$|Chemosensory cues {{signaling}} predators reliably stimulate innate defensive {{responses in}} rodents. Despite the well-documented {{role of the}} amygdala in predator odor-induced fear, evidence for the relative contribution of the specific nuclei that comprise this structurally heterogeneous structure is conflicting. In an effort to clarify this we examined neural activity, via electrophysiological recordings, in amygdala subnuclei to controlled and repeated presentations of a predator odor: cat urine. Defensive behaviors, characterized by avoidance, decreased exploration, and increased risk assessment, were observed in adult male hooded Wistar rats (n = 11) exposed to a cloth impregnated with cat urine. Electrophysiological recordings of the amygdala (777 multiunit clusters) were subsequently obtained in freely breathing anesthetized rats exposed to cat urine, distilled water, and eugenol via an air-dilution olfactometer. Recorded units selectively responded to cat urine, and frequencies of responses were distributed differently across amygdala nuclei; medial amygdala (MeA) demonstrated the greatest frequency of responses to cat urine (51. 7 %), followed by the basolateral and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nuclei</b> (18. 8 %) and finally the central amygdala (3. 0 %). Temporally, information transduction occurred primarily from the cortical amygdala and MeA (ventral divisions) to other amygdala nuclei. Interestingly, MeA subnuclei exhibited distinct firing patterns to predator urine, potentially revealing aspects of the underlying neurocircuitry of predator odor processing and defensiveness. These findings highlight the critical involvement of the MeA in processing olfactory cues signaling predator threat and converge with previous studies to indicate that amygdala regulation of predator odor-induced fear is restricted to {{a particular set of}} subnuclei that primarily include the MeA, particularly the ventral divisions...|$|R
40|$|Amygdaloid complex (AC) is a {{heterogeneous}} group of subcortical nuclei and cortical structures {{which has a}} crucial role in the limbic system functions, and which is interconnected with many brain regions. The projections from the AC to the posterior insular cortex, were studied in 5 male adult rats by retrograde marking of neurons with pseudorabies virus (PRV). After inoculation of PRV into the insular cortex, rats were sacrificed after 51, 57 or 72 hours. The serial sections of AC were examined by using immunohistochemistry, with an antibody against PRV. The goal of this study was to identify the nuclei of rat AC with the presence of PRV, to estimate the density of PRV, and also to note the speed of PRV propagation from the posterior insular cortex to AC. Clear distribution of PRV particles in amygdaloid nucleus was observed in the rat brain after 72 hours while in earlier sacrificed animals (51 and 57 hours) there was no positive reaction. The high density of PRV-immunoreactive neurons was in the ipsilateral lateral and basolateral nucleus, as well as in the amygdalohippocampal area. The lower density was in the ipsilateral basomedial, central, medial, posterior cortical nucleus, and nuclei of lateral olfactory tracts, as well as in the contralateral <b>basomedial</b> <b>nucleus.</b> In conclusion, by PRV retrograde tracing was found that the main projections of AC to posterior insular cortex originate from lateral and basolateral nucleus which are known as important regions of sensory convergence of AC, and from the amygdalohyppocampal area, as well.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and morphology of neurons containing somatostatin (SOM) {{was investigated in}} the amygdala (CA) of the pig. The SOM-immunoreactive (SOM-IR) cell bodies and fibres were present in all subdivisions of the porcine CA, however, their number and density varied depending on the nucleus studied. The highest density of SOM-positive somata was observed in the layer III of the cortical nuclei, in the anterior (magnocellular) part of the <b>basomedial</b> <b>nucleus</b> and in the caudal (large-celled) part of the lateral nucleus. Moderate to high numbers of SOM-IR cells were also observed in the medial and basolateral nuclei. Many labeled neurons were also consistently observed in the lateral part of the central nucleus. In the remaining CA regions, the density of SOM-positive cell bodies varied from moderate to low. In any CA region studied SOM-IR neurons formed heterogeneous population consisting of small, rounded or slightly elongated cell bodies, with a few poorly branched smooth dendrites. In general, morphological features of these cells clearly resembled the non-pyramidal Golgi type II interneurons. The routine double-labeling studies with antisera directed against SOM and neuropeptide Y (NPY) demonstrated {{that a large number}} of SOM-IR cell bodies and fibers in all studied CA areas contained simultaneously NPY. In contrast, co-localization of SOM and cholecystokinin (CCK) or SOM and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was never seen in cell bodies and fibres in any of nuclei studied. In conclusion, SOM-IR neurons of the porcine amygdala form large and heterogeneous subpopulation of, most probably, interneurons that often contain additionally NPY. On the other hand, CCK- and/or VIP-IR neurons belonged to another, discrete subpopulations of porcine CA neurons...|$|R
40|$|As is well recognized, serotonergic (5 -HT) fibers {{distribute}} widely {{throughout the}} forebrain, including the amygdala. Although a few reports {{have examined the}} 5 -HT innervation of select nuclei of the amygdala in the rat, no previous report has described overall 5 -HT projections to the amygdala in the rat. Using immunostaining for the serotonin transporter, SERT, we describe the complete pattern of distribution of 5 -HT fibers to the amygdala (proper) and to the extended amygdala in the rat. Based on its ontogenetic origins, the amygdala was subdivided into two major parts, pallial and subpallial components, with the pallial component further divided into superficial and deep nuclei (Olucha-Bordonau et al. 2015). SERT+ fibers were shown to distributed moderately to densely to the deep and cortical pallial nuclei, but, by contrast, lightly to the subpallial nuclei. Specifically, 1) of the deep pallial nuclei, the lateral, basolateral, and <b>basomedial</b> <b>nuclei</b> contained a very dense concentration of 5 -HT fibers; 2) of the cortical pallial nuclei, the anterior cortical and amygdala–cortical transition zone rostrally and the posteromedial and posterolateral nuclei caudally contained a moderate concentration of 5 -HT fibers; and 3) of the subpallial nuclei, the anterior nuclei and the rostral part of the medial (Me) nuclei contained a moderate concentration of 5 -HT fibers, whereas caudal regions of Me {{as well as the}} central nuclei and the intercalated nuclei contained a sparse/light concentration of 5 -HT fibers. With regard to the extended amygdala (primarily the bed nucleus of stria terminalis; BST), on the whole, the BST contained moderate numbers of 5 -HT fibers, spread fairly uniformly throughout BST. The findings are discussed with respect to a critical serotonergic influence on the amygdala, particularly on the basal complex, and on the extended amygdala in the control of states of fear and anxiety.

40|$|The {{amygdala}} plays {{a critical}} role in determining the emotional significance of sensory stimuli and the production of fear-related responses. Large amygdalar lesions have been shown to practically abolish innate defensiveness to a predator; however, {{it is not clear how}} the different amygdalar systems participate in the defensive response to a live predator. Our first aim was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the amygdalar activation pattern during exposure to a live cat and to a predator-associated context. Accordingly, exposure to a live predator up-regulated Fos expression in the medial amygdalar nucleus (MEA) and in the lateral and posterior <b>basomedial</b> <b>nuclei,</b> the former responding to predator-related pheromonal information and the latter two nuclei likely to integrate a wider array of predatory sensory information, ranging from olfactory to non-olfactory ones, such as visual and auditory sensory inputs. Next, we tested how the amygdalar nuclei most responsive to predator exposure (i. e. the medial, posterior basomedial and lateral amygdalar nuclei) and the central amygdalar nucleus (CEA) influence both unconditioned and contextual conditioned anti-predatory defensive behavior. Medial amygdalar nucleus lesions practically abolished defensive responses during cat exposure, whereas lesions of the posterior basomedial or lateral amygdalar nuclei reduced freezing and increased risk assessment displays (i. e. crouch sniff and stretch postures), a pattern of responses compatible with decreased defensiveness to predator stimuli. Moreover, the present findings suggest a role for the posterior basomedial and lateral amygdalar nuclei in the conditioning responses to a predator-related context. We have further shown that the CEA does not seem to be involved in either unconditioned or contextual conditioned anti-predatory responses. Overall, the present results help to clarify the amygdalar systems involved in processing predator-related sensory stimuli and how they influence the expression of unconditioned and contextual conditioned anti-predatory responses.

40|$|Patterns of NR {{expression}} in the Amygdala The Amg concept {{can be traced to}} Johnston (Johnston, 1923), who introduced the fundamental anatomical description of the amygdalar complex. Decades later, the definition of this brain region as a structural and functional entity is still a matter of debate (Lanuza et al., 1999; Swanson and Petrovich, 1998). Located in the medial temporal lobe, the Amg has key role in the modulation of fear, anxiety and stress, but it is also involved in pain and feeding, reward evaluation, and in many behavioral responses that depend on social interactions (references in Supplemental Review of Literature). Among the several Amg nuclei (Figure S 3), we have concentrated our analysis on the basolateral complex (comprising lateral La, basolateral BLA and <b>basomedial</b> BLV <b>nuclei),</b> the central nucleus (CeA), and the medial amygdala (MeA). Because of its deep location, the Amg could not be individualized for separate qRT-PCR analysis and only ISH data are available.

40|$|AbstractThe medial amygdaloid nucleus (Me) {{integrates}} pheromonal and olfactory {{information with}} gonadal hormone cues, being implicated in social behaviors. It is divided cytoarchitectonically in an anterodorsal, anteroventral (MeAV), posterodorsal and posteroventral part, whose projections are well characterized, {{except for those}} of the tiny MeAV. Here, MeAV efferents were examined in the rat with the anterograde Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde Fluoro-Gold (FG) tracers and {{compared with those of}} other Me parts. The present PHA-L observations show that the MeAV projects profusely to itself, but its projections to other Me parts are modest. In conjunction with FG experiments, they suggest that the MeAV innervates robustly a restricted set of structures it shares with the anterodorsal and/or posteroventral Me. Its major targets are the core of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (especially the dorsomedial and central parts), reached mainly via the stria terminalis, and the amygdalostriatal transition area. In addition, the MeAV innervates substantially the lateral and posterior <b>basomedial</b> amygdaloid <b>nuclei</b> and the intraamygdaloid bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In contrast to other Me parts, it provides only modest inputs to the main and accessory olfactory systems, medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and reproductive hypothalamic nuclei. This anatomical framework suggests that the MeAV {{may play a role in}} orienting responses to chemosensory cues and defensive behaviors elicited by the odor of predators...|$|R
40|$|An optimal {{coordination}} {{between parents and}} their offspring involves a sequence of reciprocal behaviors to ensure the adequate care of the young, which is critical for a healthy physical, emotional, and social development. Parental deprivation, particularly an impaired child-mother attachment, induces lasting changes in emotional {{as well as in}} cognitive capacities in later life. We assessed in the South American precocial species, Octodon degus, whether alterations of glutamatergic function of the limbic system induced by parental deprivation may be a neural correlate for such behavioral changes. Further, we analyzed whether the mother’s voice can protect from separation-induced changes of brain function. Changes of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression were examined in the following three groups of 2 -week-old Octodon degus pups: (I) control animals who remained undisturbed with the family; (II) animals who were repeatedly separated from the family and individually placed in an unfamiliar environment for behavioral analysis (open field); and (III) animals who were treated like the group described under (lI) but were presented with maternal vocalizations during separation. Relative to those in the control group I, the animals in group II showed an upregulation of NMDA receptor density in the (a) anterior cingulate, prelimbic, infralimbic, and anterior insular cortices; (b) CA 1 /stratum radiatum; (c) CA 1 /stratum lacunosum moleculare and CA 3 /stratum radiatum; and (d) in the <b>basomedial</b> amygdaloid <b>nucleus.</b> Presentation of the maternal call during the separation period (group III) suppressed the separation-induced NMDA receptor upregulation in all regions.
