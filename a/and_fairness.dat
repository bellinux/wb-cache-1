5|$|By {{the time}} of Harivarma in 390, the Gangas had {{consolidated}} their kingdom with Talakad as their capital. Their move from the early capital Kolar {{may have been a}} strategic one with the intention of containing the growing Kadamba power. By 430 they had consolidated their eastern territories comprising modern Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur districts and by 470 they had gained control over Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu, Sendraka (modern Chikkamagaluru and Belur), Punnata and Pannada regions (comprising modern Heggadadevanakote and Nanjangud) in modern Karnataka. In 529, King Durvinita ascended the throne after waging a war with his younger brother who was favoured by his father, King Avinita. Some accounts suggest that in this power struggle, the Pallavas of Kanchi supported Avinita's choice of heir and the Badami Chalukya King Vijayaditya supported his father-in-law, Durvinita. From the inscriptions it is known that these battles were fought in Tondaimandalam and Kongu regions (northern Tamil Nadu) prompting historians to suggest that Durvinita fought the Pallavas successfully. Considered the most successful of the Ganga kings, Durvinita was well versed in arts such as music, dance, ayurveda and taming wild elephants.

Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity <b>and</b> <b>fairness</b> of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds {{in the war on terror}} as key priorities.|$|E

For one, research has shown that if each employee has their performance individually measured, they will put in more effort than if it was not measured. Another person interested in the idea of social loafing is Kenneth Price, from The University of Texas. Price conducted a social loafing experiment in order to examine whether two key factors that he suspected {{played a role in the}} way social loafing arose in work groups. These two factors were dispensability <b>and</b> <b>fairness.</b> The experiment that he conducted involved 514 people that were divided into 144 teams that were set to meet for fourteen weeks. The projects assigned to these people were very complex and called for diverse skills from many different individuals in order to be fully completed. The experiments findings did in fact corroborate Price's suspicions in the two factors of dispensability <b>and</b> <b>fairness.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A good {{crossbar}} switch scheduler {{should be able}} to achieve 100 % throughput <b>and</b> maintain <b>fairness</b> among competing flows. A pure input-queued (IQ) non-buffered switch requires an impractically complex scheduler to achieve this goal. Common solutions are to use crossbar speedup and/or buffered crossbar. In this paper, we explore this issue in a buffered crossbar without speedup. We first discuss the conflict between <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> throughput <b>and</b> the <b>fairness</b> criteria in {{crossbar switch}} scheduling, and justify that a desirable scheduler should sustain full bandwidth for admissible traffic <b>and</b> ensure max-min <b>fairness</b> for non-admissible traffic. Then we describe an adaptive maxmin fair scheduling (AMFS) algorithm and show by analysis and simulation that it can provide both 100 % throughput <b>and</b> max-min <b>fairness.</b> Finally we briefly discuss the hardware implementation of the AMFS algorithm.
