5|$|Chabon's work is {{characterized}} by complex language, the frequent use of metaphor along with recurring themes, including nostalgia, divorce, abandonment, fatherhood, and most notably issues of Jewish identity. He often includes gay, bisexual, <b>and</b> <b>Jewish</b> characters in his work. Since the late 1990s, Chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets; he is a notable defender of the merits of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, he has published screenplays, children's books, comics, and newspaper serials.|$|E
5|$|Disorder spread {{throughout}} Aleppo {{the morning after}} Mansur's flight. Aleppines looted Mansur's palace, taking some 80,000 gold dinars-worth of property. The medieval Aleppine chronicler Ibn al-Adim further noted that 28,000 volumes of manuscripts stored in the palace library were lost. A number of Christian <b>and</b> <b>Jewish</b> homes were also plundered. Though actual members of the Hamdanid dynasty had lost power by 1002, many contemporary Arabic chroniclers consider Mansur's ouster to represent the formal end of the Hamdanid emirate.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, the Pieds-Noirs {{numbered}} 1,025,000, {{and accounted}} for 10.4% {{of the total population}} of Algeria, a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of Pieds-Noirs, such as the regions of Bône (now Annaba), Algiers, and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès. Oran had been under European rule since the 17th century, and the population in the Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European <b>and</b> <b>Jewish</b> in 1959. In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans <b>and</b> <b>Jewish</b> people accounted for 35.7% of the population. In the metropolitan area of Bône they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The département of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520km² (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest Pied-Noir density outside of the cities, with the Pieds-Noirs accounting for 33.6% {{of the population of the}} département in 1959.|$|E

5|$|In November 1938, a young Jewish man {{requested}} {{an interview}} with the German ambassador in Paris and met with a legation secretary, whom he shot and killed to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues <b>and</b> <b>Jewish</b> property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were killed during this pogrom, later called Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months– they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library or own weapons <b>and</b> <b>Jewish</b> pupils were removed from schools. The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by Kristallnacht and told that any money received via insurance claims would be confiscated. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine and other countries. Many chose to stay in continental Europe. Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there {{under the terms of the}} Haavara Agreement, but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind and it was seized by the government.|$|E
