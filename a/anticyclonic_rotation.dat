40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of the {{background}} rotation on the radiative instability of a columnar Rankine vortex in a strongly stratified fluid. We show that a cyclonic background rotation strongly stabilizes the radiative instability. The modes become neutral when the Rossby number Ro is below a critical value which depends on the azimuthal wavenumber of the wave. In the limit of small Rossby number, there exist fast neutral waves that are not captured by the quasi-geostrophic theory. In the presence of <b>anticyclonic</b> background <b>rotation,</b> the centrifugal instability dominates the radiative instability only when - 400 less than or similar to Ro < - 1. The numerical stability analysis is completed by asymptotic analyses for large wavenumbers which explain the properties and mechanisms of the waves and the instabilities. The stability of a continuous smoothed Rankine vortex is also investigated. The most amplified azimuthal wavenumber is then finite instead of infinite for the Rankine vortex.

40|$|For {{pressure-driven}} turbulent channel flows undergoing spanwise system rotation, it {{has been}} observed that the absolute vorticity, i. e., the sum of the averaged spanwise flow vorticity and system rotation, tends to zero in the central region of the channel. This observation has so far eluded a convincing theoretical explanation, despite experimental and numerical evidence reported in the literature. Here we show experimentally that three-dimensional laminar structures in plane Couette flow, which appear under <b>anticyclonic</b> system <b>rotation,</b> give the same effect, namely, that the absolute vorticity tends to zero if the rotation rate is high enough. It is shown that this is equivalent to a local Richardson number of approximately zero, which would indicate a stable condition. We also offer an explanation based on Kelvin’s circulation theorem to demonstrate that the absolute vorticity should remain constant and approximately equal to zero in the central region of the channel when going from the nonrotating fully turbulent state to any state with sufficiently high rotation...|$|R
40|$|Hourly surface {{observations}} from the Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Dataset were analyzed {{with respect to}} long-term wind direction drift or rotation. Most of the Canadian landmass, including the High Arctic, exhibits a spatially consistent and remarkably steady <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> of wind direction. The period of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> recorded at 144 out of 149 Canadian meteostations directly correlated with latitude and ranged from 7 days at Medicine Hat (50 &# 176;N, 110 &# 176;W) to 25 days at Resolute (75 &# 176;N, 95 &# 176;W). Only five locations {{in the vicinity of}} the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast were found to obey a &# 8220;negative&# 8221; (i. e., cyclonic) rotation.

40|$|Looping {{motions of}} RAFOS floats {{deployed}} off the Central California coast between 1992 and 2010 are described. Most floats were {{deployed in the}} California Undercurrent. Floats at 300 m were observed to loop 26 % of the time, with <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> observed about twice as often as cyclonicrotation. Characteristics of <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> at 300 m included median swirl speeds of 14 cm/s for diameters of 59 km and 14 -day periods. Long-lived (> 70 days and at least 8 consecutive loops) anticyclonic loopers are identified as California Undercurrent eddies (or ‘‘cuddies’’). One cuddy was observed to move southwestward 1650 km {{over a period of}} 520 days before observations ended. Kinematically, cuddies are similar to Mediterranean Water eddies (meddies) in the Iberian Basin, except that meddies are somewhat stronger, larger and deeper. Over the slope,most cuddies were formed between either Pt. Sur and Pt. Reyes or Cape Mendocino and Cape Blanco. The region north of Cape Mendocino is estimated to generate six cuddies each year. These eddies form from waters on the inshore side of the California Undercurrent as they move past Cape Mendocino. Topographic drag is the most likely formation mechanism. Two of eight deep floats were observed to loop, one anticyclonically (1545 m) for 279 days and the other cyclonically (1167 m) for 192 days. Looping for these floats ended near Taney Seamounts...|$|E

40|$|A severe left-moving {{thunderstorm}} {{occurred on}} 25 May 1999 between {{the cities of}} Lubbock and Amarillo, Texas.

40|$|Direct {{observations}} of the velocity field of a submesoscale coherent vortex in the Greenland Sea by a vessel mounted ADCP, together with a detailed and complete investigation of its hydrographic structure, show that within the eddy the hydrographic structure differs from the background and indicate that the entire water column of 3. 7 km depth is included in an <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> with maximum azimuthal speeds at roughly 2000 m depth. Within a radius of about 9 km the water layers rotate in a solid body fashion.

Due to the unique possibility in the high latitudes to 'recharge' the eddy by surface forcing during winter and a corresponding long lifetime such eddies represent key areas for future bottom water production...|$|E
40|$|On 6 September 1994, an {{isolated}} thunderstorm over south-ern Virginia split into separate left-moving and right-moving thunderstorms {{with respect to}} the mean 0 - 6 km wind. The left-mover maintained its strength longer than the right-mover, and each storm produced large hail along their respective storm paths. An analysis {{of the structure of the}} thunderstorms was pel/ormed through an examination of products from the Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler located in Wake-field, Virginia. The structure of the thunderstorms, with respect to base reflectivity and internal wind structure, indicated char-acteristically high reflectivity returns, cyclonic rotation in the right-moving storm and <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> in the left-moving storm. However, the left- and right-moving storms also exhib-ited oppositely rotating regions within each respective thunder-storm, possibly induced by each storm's stronger dominant rotation. Also, low-le vel rotational velocities associated with the thunderstorms were indicative of possible tornadic activity yet tornadoes or funnel clouds were not observed. The absence of tornadic activity was most likely due to an unfavorable vertical wind profile in the storm-scale environment and the lack of depth of the circulations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Jupiter's {{dominant}} large-scale {{weather patterns}} (dimensions ~ 10, 000 km) are zonal jets and long-lived ovals. The jets have been flowing {{east and west}} at constant speeds of up to 180 m s^(- 1) for over 100 years. These jets receive energy from small-scale eddies, which pump eastward momentum into the eastward jets and westward momentum into the westward jets. This momentum transfer was predicted by numerical models before it was observed on Jupiter. The large ovals roll between the jets in an anticyclonic direction—clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere—where they regularly assimilate small anticyclonic eddies. But from where the eddies receive their energy has been an open question. Here we argue that the eddies, which ultimately drive both the jets and the ovals, receive their energy from moist convection. This hypothesis is consistent with observations of jovian lightning, which is an indicator of moist convection. It also explains the <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> and poleward drift of the eddies, and suggests patterns of upwelling and downwelling that resemble the patterns of large-scale axisymmetric overturning in the Earth's atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{made by the}} {{specially}} inst,rurnonted aircraft, opcbratcd by thc National Hurricane Research Project, {{establish the}} occurrence of dynamic instability, notably {{in the form of}} anomalous winds in the upper troposphere above hurricane Daisy, shortly after its inception. It is infcrred that the dynamic instability released by these anomalous winds, which represent <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> in space, triggered Daisy's development. Since the observed dynamic instability occurred on a mcsoscalc, the above inference is not amenable to direct verification from synoptic maps. Howrvcr, synoptic cotlditions favorable for the development of anomalous winds are discussed and it is found that thcse conditions prevailed in the upper troposphere directly above Ilaisy and Gracie a short time before they reached hurricane intensity.

40|$|With {{the aid of}} 8900 micron CH 4 filter {{photographs}} it {{is shown}} that the Red Spot is normally the highest cloud feature in the Jovian atmosphere, located squarely on the South Tropical Zone at 22 deg. S. The Red Spot is a rising column, obviously having its own energy source; it spreads outward at the top level, in <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation.</b> It is concluded that the large and persistent Jovian cloud masses, of which the Red Spot is the largest, are major organized storm arrays embedded in a near stagnant atmosphere, each probably possessing numerous short-lived rising hot columns driven by released latent heat; and covered by a horizontally-expanding gigantic cirrus cloud system, in anti-cyclonic rotation. The meteorological theory of Organized Cumulus Convection {{is applied to the}} Red Spot and the White Ovals. Evidence exists that the array of hot towers under the Red Spot is eccentric.

40|$|International audienceTropical {{instability}} {{waves and}} tropical instability vortices (TIVs) exert major controls on ocean dynamics, thermodynamics, and biology on intraseasonal to seasonal time scales. To understand the fundamental mechanisms at play, a Lagrangian {{analysis of the}} 3 D circulation of westward-propagating TIVs was performed in a high-resolution Atlantic Ocean simulation. The model reproduces the main temperature and velocity features of the tropical Atlantic mean state and the TIVs. Lagrangian diagnostics were used to track the water masses transported in vortices and exchanged with surrounding waters. The 3 D circulation within vortices {{is consistent with previous}} observations and dominated by <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> with downwelling and upwelling near the leading and trailing edges of the vortex, respectively. This convergent flow creates sharp gradients at the TIV southwestern edge, where vertical mixing is most efficient. While TIVs remain highly dynamically coherent throughout their lifetime, significant exchanges occur with their surroundings, with 50 % of their water being renewed over one rotation cycle. A detailed investigation of the eddies' sources and sinks reveals that they mostly transport southern water zonally, while northern waters are mostly passing through or fluxed southward in their lee. A notable source of entrained water is the Equatorial Undercurrent...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{strongly}} stratified fluids, an axisymmetric vertical columnar vortex is unstable {{because of}} a spontaneous radiation of internal waves. The growth rate of this radiative instability is strongly reduced {{in the presence of}} a cyclonic background rotation f/ 2 and is smaller than the growth rate of the centrifugal instability for <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation,</b> so it is generally expected to affect vortices in geophysical flows only if the Rossby number Ro = 2 Omega/f is large (where Omega is the angular velocity of the vortex). However, we show here that an anticyclonic Rankine vortex with low Rossby number in the range - 1 <= Ro < 0, which is centrifugally stable, is unstable to the radiative instability when the azimuthal wavenumber vertical bar m vertical bar is larger than 2. Its growth rate for Ro = - 1 is comparable to the values reported in non-rotating stratified fluids. In the case of continuous vortex profiles, this new radiative instability is shown to occur if the potential vorticity of the base flow has a sufficiently steep radial profile. The most unstable azimuthal wavenumber is inversely proportional to the steepness of the vorticity jump. The properties and mechanism of the instability are explained by asymptotic analyses for large wavenumbers...|$|E

Optical depths were evaluated from both the Meteosat and lidar data. Back trajectory calculations were also made along selected lidar orbits to verify the characteristic <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> of the dust plume over the eastern Atlantic as well as to trace the origin of a dust outbreak over West Africa.

40|$|Abstract [...] Ship and {{satellite}} observations {{taken over the}} last thirty years show that mesoscale patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) in the California Current System are consistently found throughout the year and usually occur in approximately the same geographical locations. Typically, these patterns are more pronounced in fall/winter than in spring/summer. The temporal and spatial characteristics of these persistent features were examined with satellite infrared (IR) measurements during winter 1980 - 81. In January 1981, a ship surveyed the vertical structure of several physical, chemical, and biological parame-ters beneath one of these SST features centered near 32 °N, 124 °W. The surface IR pattern had a length scale of 200 km and a time scale of about 100 days. It disintegrated following the first two storms of the winter season. Motion studies of the pattern in late October indicated an <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> with max-imum velocities of 50 cm s- 1 at 50 km from the axis of rotation. As a unit, the pattern advected south-ward with an average speed of 1 cm s- 1. Thermal fronts, determined from the satellite imagery, were strongest (0. 4 °C km-L) along the rim of the pattern and were advected anticyclonically with the pattern: their length scales were 20 - 30 km in the along-front direction and less than 10 km wide. The hydro-graphic data revealed a three-layer structure beneath the surface pattern: a 75 m deep surface layer, a cold-core region from 75 to 200 m depth, and a warm-core ddy extending from 250 to 1450 m.

40|$|This study {{documents}} the time evolution of air temperature and heat waves occurrences over Northern Africa {{for the period}} 1979 - 2011. A significant warming (1 degrees- 3 degrees C), appearing by the mid- 1960 s over Sahara and Sahel, is associated with higher/lesser frequency of warm/cold temperatures, as with longer duration and higher occurrences of heat waves. Heat waves episodes of at least 4 day duration have been examined after removing the long-term evolution. These episodes are associated with specific anomalies: (i) in spring, positive low-level temperature anomalies over the Sahel and Sahara; low and midlevel cyclonic rotation over Morocco associated with a Rossby wave pattern, lessening the Harmattan; more/less atmospheric moisture westward/eastward to 0 degrees; upward/downward anomalies above the western/eastern regions associated with the Rossby wave pattern; (ii) in summer, a similar but weaker positive low-level temperature anomaly (up to 3 degrees C); less moisture westward to 10 degrees W, a cyclonic anomaly in central Sahel favoring the monsoon eastward to 0 degrees and a midlevel anticyclonic anomaly over the Western Sahara, increasing southward the flux divergence associated with the African Easterly Jet. In March-May, two to three heat waves propagate eastward. They are preceded by an abnormal warm cell over Libya and southwesterlies over the West Sahara. A large trough stands over North Atlantic while midtropospheric subsidence and <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> reinforce over the continent, then migrates toward the Arabian peninsula in breaking up. These signals are spatially coherent and might suggest the role of short Rossby waves with an eastward group velocity and a baroclinic mode, possibly associated with jet stream deformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} wind on the ocean surface results in the {{formation}} of Ekman spirals, as proposed by V. W. Ekman in 1905. The spirals display exponential decay of current speed and <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> with increasing depth. Observations of Ekman spirals are extremely rare, and there are few studies that test Ekman theory against observations. Here we present a unique array of velocity profiles from EM-APEX profiling floats, which we use to examine the nature of Ekman spirals in the Southern Ocean and test how well they are described by theory. Classical Ekman theory assumes the momentum mixing within the upper ocean is set by a constant eddy viscosity. However, previous observational studies have found Ekman spirals to be compressed, with different viscosities estimated from current speed and rotation. This behaviour has been linked to surface trapping of Ekman currents (Price et al. 1987) or could arise due to a failure to consider depth varying geostrophic currents (Polton et al. 2013). We use 1400 profiles of velocity from EM-APEX floats, collected at the northern Kerguelen Plateau as part of the Southern Ocean FINE-structure (SOFINE) expedition during the Austral summer of 2008 - 9, to investigate whether a constant viscosity parameterization {{is the best way to}} represent momentum mixing in the upper ocean, or whether other methods such as a depth-varying viscosity or a mixing scheme linked with stratification (e. g. Price et al., 1986) are more effective. Previous studies of Ekman layer observations have examined either the raw observations, or models of momentum input in the spectral domain or in the time domain. In this study we use all three approaches to build a robust picture of Ekman spirals in the Southern Ocean and their response to wind forcing. Ekman velocities were isolated from inertial and geostrophic currents in the absolute velocity profiles. Estimates of eddy viscosity and Ekman layer depth were separately obtained from profiles of current speed and heading. Assuming a vertically-uniform geostrophic current the Ekman layer depths from current heading were approximately twice as large as those from current speed decay. This degree of spiral compression has been observed in prior studies. Assuming a linear geostrophic shear, constant viscosity estimates from current heading and speed decay converged towards a common value, implying a significant reduction in the compression of the Ekman spirals. Including geostrophic shear through the Ekman layer also increased the number of EM-APEX profiles displaying Ekman spiral-like behaviour from 224 to 441, and reduced the RMS velocity residual between fitted and observed spirals. There was no clear relationship between the observed viscosities and mixed layer depth or strength of stratification. This suggests that the compressed spirals observed in previous studies are due to aliasing the geostrophic current into the Ekman spiral (Polton et al. 2013), rather than surface trapping of Ekman currents associated with stratification. Nine conceptual Ekman models were fitted to the observations in the spectral domain using the method of Elipot and Gille (2009). Application of the spectral technique to shipboard ADCP and in situ wind data indicated a constant viscosity model with a finite boundary layer depth (BLD) was the best performing model. Eddy viscosities agreed with Elipot’s results for the same latitude bands but the optimal BLD was found to be deeper for the SOFINE region. Examination of Elipot’s results indicate that within the latitude band of our study bootstrap, estimates of summer BLDs displayed a greater range of variability than the year round or winter BLDs. This suggests that the deeper BLDs observed in our study were principally due to the timing of SOFINE. A similar analysis using EM-APEX float data and blended reanalysis-scatterometer winds was inconclusive. To test for the effects of time-varying wind forcing and stratification in the mixed layer, we ran linear and stratified Ekman models with the Price Weller and Pinkel (1986) mixing scheme, forced by both in situ shipboard winds and a variety of reanalysis wind data. Model time mean skill was analysed by comparing the correlation between the simulated and observed mean current profiles. Time varying performance was assessed using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and quantile-quantile plots. For the model runs with the shipboard winds, the classical linear time-varying Ekman model offered the best performance. Model runs using 6 hourly reanalysis winds interpolated onto the float tracks performed poorly, preventing a proper assessment of skill of the stratified models relative to the linear Ekman models. The combined evidence in this thesis suggests that the classical constant viscosity Ekman model offers an adequate representation of the near surface response to wind forcing with a minimal number of parameters...|$|E
