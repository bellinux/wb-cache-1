5|$|The {{wooden core}} gives the bow its shape and {{dimensional}} stability. It is often made of multiple pieces, joined with <b>animal</b> <b>glue</b> in V-splices, so the wood must accept glue well. Pieced construction allows the sharp bends that many designs require, {{and the use}} of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and nonbending sections.|$|E
5|$|The sinew, {{soaked in}} <b>animal</b> <b>glue,</b> is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of sinew are {{oriented}} along the length of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{adhesives}} {{are made}} from organic sources such as vegetable starch (dextrin), natural resins, or animals (e.g. the milk protein casein and hide-based <b>animal</b> <b>glues).</b> These are {{often referred to as}} bioadhesives.|$|R
5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self bows, and the <b>animal</b> <b>glue</b> used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E
5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce <b>animal</b> <b>glue.</b> Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>glue</b> is an {{adhesive}} {{that contains}} various animal parts such as bone, skin, or fish and is widely used. It is a soft adhesive and can appear white, but usually has a pale yellow or brown appearance. <b>Animal</b> <b>glue</b> is very soft and {{can easily be}} broken down and removed with warm water and steam. Although easily reversible, the relative ease with which the glue breaks down makes it a less strong bonding method.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>animal</b> <b>glues</b> are soluble in water, {{useful for}} joints which may {{at some time}} need to be separated. Alcohol is {{sometimes}} applied to such joints to dehydrate the glue, making it more brittle and easier to crack apart.|$|R
25|$|Bone glue {{can be made}} by {{prolonged}} boiling {{of ground}} or cracked bones, followed by filtering and evaporation to thicken the resulting fluid. Historically once important, bone <b>glue</b> and other <b>animal</b> <b>glues</b> today have only a few specialized uses, such as in antiques restoration. Essentially the same process, with further refinement, thickening and drying, is used to make gelatin.|$|R

It {{is also possible that}} the adhesives themselves might simply deteriorate over time.|$|R
25|$|Commonly used {{woodworking}} tools included axes, adzes, chisels, pull saws, and bow drills. Mortise and tenon joints are attested {{from the}} earliest Predynastic period. These joints were strengthened using pegs, dowels and leather or cord lashings. <b>Animal</b> <b>glue</b> came to be used only in the New Kingdom period. Ancient Egyptians invented the art of veneering and used varnishes for finishing, though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native acacias were used, as was the wood from the local sycamore and tamarisk trees, deforestation in the Nile valley resulted in {{the need for the}} importation of wood, notably cedar, but also Aleppo pine, boxwood and oak, starting from the Second Dynasty.|$|E
500|$|The restorers, by {{assuming}} that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration.

Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster.

500|$|The small Philadelphia {{panel is}} painted with oil on {{parchment}} (vellum); a reconstructed red vermilion border surrounds the image– it {{is similar to}} those seen in contemporary illuminated manuscripts. [...] It gives the illusion of the viewer looking through {{a window into the}} landscape. The parchment measures the image measures [...] Underneath are five wood supports; the parchment is glued to one, and four smaller pieces, added at a later date, frame the image. The parchment is unusually thick and has a thin insoluble layer of primer. The wooden frames were primed in a thick layer of white, which overlaps the parchment in places. The borders were gilded at some time; technical analysis found particles of gold leaf on the lower border. The Turin panel is painted on two oak panels joined with a band of parchment or cloth, on a ground of chalk and <b>animal</b> <b>glue.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are two {{scagliola}} techniques: {{in traditional}} Bavarian scagliola coloured batches of plaster of Paris are worked to a stiff, dough-like consistency. The plaster is modified {{with the addition}} of <b>animal</b> <b>glues</b> such as isinglass or hide glue. Marezzo scagliola or American scagliola is worked with the pigmented batches of plaster in a liquid state and relies mainly on the use of Keene's cement, a unique gypsum plaster product in which plaster of Paris was steeped in alum or borate, then burned in a kiln and ground to a fine powder; invented around 1840, it sets to an exceptionally hard state. It is typically used without the addition of <b>animal</b> <b>glues.</b> Marezzo scagliola is often called American scagliola because of its widespread use in the United States {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century. Slabs of Marezzo scagliola may be used as table tops. When set, scagliola is hard enough to be turned on a lathe to form vases, balusters and finials.|$|R

2500|$|The {{technique}} of painting on fabric with water-soluble pigments (with or without primer or ground) is well-attested. The binding medium is generally <b>animal</b> <b>glue</b> or gum arabic (see: Distemper). [...] Such an artifact is variously {{discussed in the}} literature as a tüchlein or sarga.

50|$|About 906-618 BC, China {{utilized}} fish, ox, and stag horns {{to produce}} adhesives and binders for pigments. <b>Animal</b> <b>glues</b> were employed as binders in paint media during the Tang Dynasty.

Ox glue and stag-horn glues bound particles of pigments together, acting as a preservative by forming a film over the surface as the ink dried. The Chinese, such as Kao Gong Ji, also researched glue for medicinal purposes.|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{paintings were}} not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. [...] Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. [...] It was {{only during the}} Warring States period (475-221 BC) that artists began to represent the world around them. In imperial times (beginning with the Eastern Jin dynasty), painting and calligraphy in China {{were among the most}} highly appreciated arts in the court and they were often practiced by amateursaristocrats and scholar-officialswho had the leisure time necessary to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy and painting were thought to be the purest forms of art. The implements were the brush pen made of animal hair, and black inks made from pine soot and <b>animal</b> <b>glue.</b> In ancient times, writing, as well as painting, was done on silk. However, after the invention of paper in the 1st century AD, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China's history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls {{in the same way that}} paintings are.|$|E
2500|$|Mr Frederick, {{one of the}} {{neighbouring}} farmers, attacks the farm, using blasting powder {{to blow up the}} restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who [...] "could read as well as any pig", notices that the van belongs to a knacker and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways. However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves. (In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into <b>animal</b> <b>glue.)</b> ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the same}} way, traces of glue and samples {{of it were}} analyzed: the {{absorption}} bands of the spectra collected are characteristic of proteinaceous substances (1650, 1550, 1452  cm− 1 Amide I, II, III; FTIR spectrum not shown). According to the wood-working and especially with the violin-making tradition, the use of reversible protein glues has always been very common.

50|$|The veneers used by Knight were sourced {{from many}} parts of the world {{including}} West Africa, South America, the United States, France and Burma. The matching and cutting of these exotic veneers by skilled craftsmen in Knight's factory resulted in the most attractive casework. Gradually over the years Knight perfected the cabinet and without doubt their method of using high quality selected veneers on shaped and banded core stock produced great stability. Modern synthetic glues were used throughout and represent an enormous improvement on the old <b>animal</b> <b>glues,</b> which are subject to deterioration in today's centrally heated homes, schools and public places.|$|R
