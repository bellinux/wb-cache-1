5000|$|There were {{unprecedented}} Soviet {{requests for}} Western technological aid {{with the development}} of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, {{which was one of the}} key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 air intakes. (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers. Soviet approaches were also reported in British mainstream press of the time, such as The Times.|$|E

Select codes {{developed over the}} past two decades at the NASA Lewis Research Center are used. The codes include computation of (1) acoustic noise generated from a vibrating component, (2) degradation in material properties of the composite laminate at use temperature, (3) dynamic response of acoustically excited hot multilayered composite structure, (4) degradation in the first-ply strength of the excited structure due to acoustic loading, and (5) <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> resistance of the excited structure, including propulsion environment. Effects of the laminate lay-up and environment on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> life are evaluated. The results show that, by keeping the angled plies on the outer surface of the laminate, a substantial increase in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> life is obtained. The effect of environment (temperature and moisure) is to relieve the residual stresses leading to an increase in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> life of the excited panel...|$|E

However, an easily usable screening criteria for assessing the potential for <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> for operating installations has not been readily available to industry at large. Based upon theory and empirical measurements, a near-field sound pressure level screening method has been developed for evaluating piping systems. A case history will be presented that will incorporate the use of the near-field noise screening criteria for risk assessment in an existing installation. It is hoped that the use of this near-field noise screening criteria by industry will enable users to assess the risk of <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue,</b> which will lead to safer systems and help to determine the need for additional measurements and analysis...|$|E
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that new noise {{prediction}} methods and acoustic life estimation methods have matured {{to the point where}} they can be combined into a unified engineering procedure. "Life derivatives" can be extracted from parametric charts to furnish design data for preventing <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue.</b> The <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> life is shown to be sensitive to the damping ratio through the use of life derivatives. The localized nature of propeller noise can be quantified with an "isodecibel" contour diagram.

The <b>fatigue</b> cracks were grown from stress concentrators introduced into the most loaded parts of the undercarriage. It is demonstrated that the development of a fatigue crack occurs irregularly: the periods of accelerated growth are followed by the periods of slowdown. The peculiarities of crack development in different stages are analyzed. The method of fractographic analysis was used to confirm the moment of fatigue crack initiation as well.

40|$|The {{application}} of bonded repairs to structures subject to <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is investigated, {{with a view}} to developing simple solutions suitable for engineering applications. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is caused by a random response of a structure due to time varying pressure waves from engine and / or aerodynamic sources. For vibration problems the use of damping in repairs will reduce the amplitude of vibration and hence the stress intensity factor in the cracked structure. To assess the viability of the composite bonded repairs subject to <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> new analytical tools are needed. In this paper the use of a simplified dynamic analysis combined with crack-bridging theory allows the influence of damping to be assessed. This theory is adapted to panels with various edge support conditions with good results. Validation of this work is carried out using a Finite Element (F.

40|$|To protect {{installations}} {{in the gas}} and oil industry and process industries against overpressure the installation of relief systems is common practice. However, there have been incidents where such systems fail {{as a result of}} high dynamic loads caused by: the generation of shock waves when the relief valve is opened very instantly; the occurrence of two-phase flow in the relief line and the corresponding formation of slugs; instability of the relief valve and <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue.</b> This paper focuses on <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue,</b> which occasionally has been the cause of incidents like at Krechba – In Salah Gas Project Algeria where a breakdown of a relief system occurred. The extremely high sound levels caused by the expanding flow through a relief line finally caused fatigue failure of the system. Such incidents are the reason for the requirement to analyze the possibility of <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> of relief systems and other systems with a strong acoustic source already during the design. In the paper we present the method that TNO applied for <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> analysis. So far a calculation of the internal sound power levels was made and evaluated against the allowable levels presented by Carucci and Mueller [1]. However, this method does not allow computing the cyclic stresses of the piping. Due to the large dimensions and the high frequencies involved, {{it is not possible to}} compute accurately the sound field in the piping and to use a deterministic method to evaluate the cyclic stresses of the piping. In this paper we present work recently done where the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) method is applied to evaluate the cyclic stresses in the piping material. Due to the statistical nature of the method, it is not possible to determine with deterministic certainty the stress levels in every point of the piping. Yet, this method gives a range of cyclic stress for each pipe section or element. This leads to a more reliable criterion for <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> studies than the earlier method, which is based on maximum allowable pressure fluctuations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} behaviour of a quasi-brittle cement concrete refractory, submitted to tensile cyclic and static loading was studied at room temperature.

The material therefore appears as sensitive to what is sometimes called static <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> emission was measured in situ and was shown to be directly related to non-linear deformation and therefore to damage. The cumulated acoustic emission event number evolution with time during static or cyclic loading shows a sigmoidal behaviour. The first part of the curve, with decreasing slope is associated to diffuse damage in the specimen. Then a concentration of the acoustic emission signals around the fracture plane is observed. This concentration operates at the inflexion point of the graph of the cumulated A. E. signal versus time, and corresponds to a macrocrack that develops to rupture. Acoustic emission could therefore be a mean of predicting the remaining life of the specime...|$|R

SOURCES OF AE UNDER FATIGUE FRACTURE In the presence of a fatigue crack during one loading cycle there is a possibility of appearance of a complex ag-gregate of the AE signals.

40|$|Acoustic myography is the {{recording}} of sounds produced by contracting muscle. These sounds become louder with increasing force of contraction. We have compared muscle sounds with surface EMG to monitor the dissociation of electrical from mechanical events (presumably, the loss of excitation–contraction coupling) which occur with motor unit <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> signals were amplified using a standard phonocardiograph, recorded on FM magnetic tape, and digitally analyzed. Muscles were examined at rest, with intermittent contractions, and with sustained contractions. We found that with <b>fatigue,</b> the <b>acoustic</b> amplitude decayed, but the surface EMG amplitude did not. With decreased effort, however, the acoustic and the surface EMG amplitudes declined simultaneously. By simultaneously recording acoustic signals and needle EMG, individual motor units were resolved acoustically in two muscles with decreased numbers of motor units and increased motor unit size. Fasciculations also produced acoustic signals, although no acoustic signal has yet been found that correlates with fibrillations. Analysis of acoustic signals from muscle provides a noninvasive method for monitoring motor unit fatigue in vivo. It may also be useful in distinguishing muscle fatigue from decreased volition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When a {{metal or}} {{composite}} structure begins to fail, for example {{due to high}} cycle <b>fatigue,</b> <b>acoustic</b> emissions caused by the propagation of cracks give rise to bursts of ultrasonic waves travelling through the structure. The health of a structure can be monitored by means of sensors which detect these waves. Acoustic emissions are often generated in experiments by breaking a pencil lead against {{the surface of the}} structure in a standardised way but the forces that this imparts are not well understood at present. A Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) algorithm has been implemented to simulate the propagation of ultrasonic waves. This code has been validated against experiments in previous work and has been shown to accurately reproduce the propagation of Lamb waves (including reflections and dispersion etc.) within thin-plate like structures. This paper deals {{with the use of the}} LISA code to characterise the forces associated with standard pencil lead breaks. The displacement due to waves emanating from a break is measured and a Differential Evolution (DE) optimisation scheme is used to find the optimal profile of forcing to match the simulation with experiment...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft and {{satellite}} structures {{are exposed to}} a wide range of temperatures during normal operation cycles. These fluctuations in temperature may result in significant changes of the structural dynamics. Aircraft, automotive, {{and satellite}} structures are also subject to various vibration sources. Passive and active vibration suppression techniques have been developed to minimize <b>acoustic</b> noise and <b>fatigue</b> stress damage. Featuring low weight solutions and high performance, active control techniques are becoming increasingly common. Structures with varying dynamics require more sophisticated active control techniques, such as adaptive control. This research uses a special vibration test rig for evaluating the performance of different vibration suppression systems on a representative aircraft panel. The test panel is clamped rigidly in a frame and can be excited in various frequencies with an electromagnetic shaker. To simulate temperature fluctuations the temperature on the panel can be increased up to 65 °C (150 °F). Smart material based sensors and actuators are used to interface the mechanical system with the electronic controller.

40|$|In TSA the thermoelastic {{temperature}} {{change in the}} surface of cyclically loaded materials is measured, which is for isotropic materials proportional to the change of {{the sum of the}} principal stresses. The sensitivity of the infrared sensors used in TSA is related non-linearly with the absolute temperature. This can be effectively corrected by a direct calibration of the thermal signal, if this is not done by the supplier of the measurement system. The injection moulded PA 6 GF 30 has layer-wise changing mechanical and thermoelastic properties. Therefore is a strain oriented approach used to calibrate the thermoelastic signal, the measured thermoelastic signal can be directly related to the sum of the principal strains. In a load increase test the thermoelastic signal increases proportional to the applied load up to a certain load-level. Beyond this load, the thermoelastic signal S increases disproportionately high compared to the applied load. The increase of the thermoelastic signal is caused by the beginning disruption of the material, what is confirmed by measuring the <b>acoustic</b> emission. Single-load <b>fatigue</b> measurements are done, indicating that the maximum applicable load under cyclic loading conditions could be determined from the thermoelastic signal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is {{the result}} of high {{frequency}} lateral vibration of an aircraft panel due to time varying pressure waves caused by engine and/or aerodynamic effects. For example, acoustically induced cracks have been recorded in the lower external surface of the nacelle skin of the F/A- 18 aircraft and aft fuselage. In the case of the inlet nacelle overall sound pressure levels of the order of 172 dB have been recorded. Attempts to repair these cracks by applying standard methods of bonded repair developed for in-plane loads were made. However, the cracks continued to grow at a similar rate. While the repair of cracked aircraft structures subjected to in-plane loads using bonded repairs has resulted in considerable aircraft life time extension and hence cost savings, the use of bonded patches to repair panels with acoustically induced cracks (<b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue)</b> is only recent. In this report a generic design procedure is presented for the repair of panels containing acoustically induced cracks using constrained layer damping (CLD). The application of bonded repairs to acoustically-induced cracks requires analytical tools that take into account high frequency out-of-plane vibration. The analytical tools described in the report will enable the rapid design of effective repairs using closed form solutions. A potential outcome for this study could be application to the repair of the batch 11 F/A- 18 aircraft which suffer from <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracking on the aft fuselage.

40|$|Currently an {{increasing}} number of RAAF F/A- 18 aircraft are developing <b>acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks on the rear fuselage. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>fatigue</b> is the result of high frequency lateral vibration of an aircraft panel as a result of time varying pressure waves caused by engine and/or aerodynamic effects. While the exact broadband power spectral density (PSD) spectrum is not available for this area of the the F/A- 18, the PSD is known for the inlet nacelle area in which cracking has occurred. Cracking in the inlet nacelle proceeded cracking in the aft fuselage by a period of several years. As a result the inlet nacelle experiences a more severe spectrum and is the PSD adopted here. Viscoelastic damping materials are used in this repair in conjunction with the constrained layer technique to reduce the lateral vibration. Since viscoelastic materials have a limited temperature range it has been necessary to use two types of damping materials to cover the expected temperature range.

40|$|The High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) {{will have}} to be {{designed}} to withstand high aerodynamic load at supersonic speeds (panel flutter) and high acoustic load (<b>acoustic</b> or sonic <b>fatigue)</b> due to fluctuating boundary layer or jet engine acoustic pressure. The thermal deflection of the skin panels will also alter the vehicle's configuration, thus it may affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle and lead to poor performance. Shape memory alloys (SMA) have an unique ability to recover large strains completely when the alloy is heated above the characteristic transformation (austenite finish T(sub f)) temperature. The recovery stress and elastic modulus are both temperature dependent, and the recovery stress also depends on the initial strain. An innovative concept is to utilize the recovery stress by embedding the initially strained SMA wire in a graphite/epoxy composite laminated panel. The SMA wires are thus restrained and large inplane forces are induced in the panel at elevated temeperatures. By embedding SMA in composite panel, the panel becomes much stiffer at elevated temperatures. That is because the large tensile inplane forces induced in the panel from the SMA recovery stress.

An unsteady-state flight of a hypersonic vehicle is composed {{of a series of}} steady-state snapshots, and for each snapshot an acoustic load is imposed to a static steady-state TPS structure. A multistep thermal-acoustic fatigue damage intensity analysis procedure is given and consists of a heat transfer analysis, a nonlinear thermoelastic analysis, and a random response analysis under a combined loading environment and the fatigue damage intensity has been evaluated with two fatigue analysis techniques. The effects of thermally induced deterministic stress and nondeterministic dynamic stress due to the acoustic loading have been considered in the damage intensity estimation with a maximum stress fatigue model.

40|$|Traditional fatigue {{analysis}} uses {{a technique called}} rainflow cycle counting to decompose a variable amplitude time signal of stress into fatigue cycles. The damage from each cycle is computed using a Wöhler curve and the damage over the entire time signal is calculated by summing the damage from all the individual cycles. In the case of <b>acoustic</b> and high-cycle <b>fatigue,</b> a long duration of time signal is often {{required in order to}} obtain a statistically representative fatigue estimate. FE-based design analysis of dynamic components using such long time signals is often rendered impractical on account of a computationally intensive forced response analysis. In most cases the loads are found to be random (or sine-on-random) in nature, and PSD are often used to describe the random loads in a more efficient manner. This representation also facilitates a very efficient FE analysis technique based on harmonic response rather than the forced response approach which is required for time signals. This paper introduces several techniques for rainflow cycle counting directly from a resultant PSD of stress. It compares these techniques with traditional rainflow analysis and concludes with a case study showing how the PSD-based analysis was used during the design of an exhaust muffler for a new city bus. ...|$|R
