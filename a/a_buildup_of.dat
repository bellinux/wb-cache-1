5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> methane gas or coal dust. As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more difficult to control the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster in which an explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
5|$|The Allegheny Plateau {{formed in}} the Alleghenian orogeny some 300million years ago, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa {{collided}} with the landmass that became North America, forming Pangaea. In the dissected plateau, years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks, forming the valleys, and leaving the hardest rocks relatively untouched. The land on which Quehanna Wild Area sits {{was part of the}} coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America in the Pennsylvanian subperiod. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1798, rumours reached Jervis, {{recently}} ennobled as Earl St Vincent, of <b>a</b> <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> French forces {{around the}} Mediterranean seaport of Toulon under General Napoleon Bonaparte. Similar rumours {{had reached the}} Admiralty in London, and St Vincent therefore sent Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson and three ships of the line to observe French activity. Nelson arrived too late however, and the French fleet had already sailed, carrying over 30,000 men into the Eastern Mediterranean. Nelson, joined by a fleet of ten ships sent by St Vincent under Captain Thomas Troubridge, pursued the French, but failed to learn of their destination before the French fleet captured Malta. Ten days later, Bonaparte sailed for Alexandria for {{the second stage of}} his operation and Nelson's fleet unwittingly passed his during the night, the British beating the French to Egypt but sailing off again before Bonaparte arrived.|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of iodine atoms onto the boron vertices of the o-carborane framework causes, according to spectroscopic data, a uniform {{increase in the}} acidic character of the Cc-H (Cc = cluster carbon) vertices, whereas the {{incorporation of}} methyl groups onto the boron vertices of the o-carborane framework reduces their acidity. Methyl groups when attached to boron are electron-withdrawing in boron clusters, whereas iodine atoms bonded to boron act as electron donors. This has been proven on B-methyl and B-iodinated o-carboranes with NMR spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations of natural bond orbital (NBO) charges, which show <b>a</b> cumulative <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> positive cluster-only total charge (CTC) on B-methyl o-carboranes and <b>a</b> cumulative <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> negative cluster-only total charge for B-iodinated o-carboranes...|$|R
