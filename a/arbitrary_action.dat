2500|$|Raja {{dismissed}} the law minister's {{suggestion that the}} issue should {{be presented to the}} Group of Ministers. After receiving the PM's 2 November 2007 letter suggesting transparency in spectrum allocation of the spectrum, Raja said it would be unfair, discriminatory, arbitrary and capricious to auction spectrum to new applicants because it would not give them a level playing field. Although a 24 September DoT press release said that 1 October would be the application deadline, he changed the deadline to 25 September. Raja's <b>arbitrary</b> <b>action,</b> [...] "though appear to be innocuous was actually intended to benefit some of the real estate firms who did not have any experience in dealing with telecom services and who had made applications only on 24 September 2007, i.e. one day before the cut-off date fixed by the C minister on his own".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1943, {{the fifth}} leaflet, [...] "Aufruf an alle Deutsche!" [...] ("Appeal to all Germans!") was {{produced}} in 6,000–9,000 copies, using a hand-operated duplicating machine. It was carried to other German Cities between 27 and 29 January 1943 by the members and supporters of the group to many cities, and then mailed from there. Copies appeared in Saarbrücken, Stuttgart, Cologne, Vienna, Freiburg, Chemnitz, Hamburg, Innsbruck and Berlin. Sophie Scholl stated during her Gestapo interrogation that from summer 1942 on, {{the aim of the}} White Rose was to address a broader range of the population. Consequently, in the fifth leaflet, the name of the group was changed from White Rose to [...] "German Resistance Movement", and also the style of writing became more polemic and less intellectual. The students had become convinced during their military service that the war was lost: [...] "Hitler kann den Krieg nicht gewinnen, nur noch verlängern. - Hitler cannot win the war, he can only prolong it." [...] They appealed to renounce [...] "national socialist subhumanism", imperialism and Prussian militarism [...] "for all time". The reader was urged to [...] "Support the resistance movement!" [...] in the struggle for [...] "freedom of speech, freedom of religion and protection of the individual citizen from the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>action</b> of criminal dictator-states". These were the principles that would form [...] "the foundations of a new Europe".|$|E

In experiment 1 we demonstrate that children will overimitate {{in this way}} even when the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>actions</b> copied are used {{as part of a}} process to achieve an outcome for someone else. We subsequently show in experiment 2 that children will omit <b>arbitrary</b> <b>actions,</b> but only if the actions are to achieve a clear, functional goal for a naïve adult. These findings highlight how readily children adopt what appear to be conventional behaviors, even when faced with a clear demonstration of their negligible functional value.

5000|$|Lettres de cachet ( [...] , lit.

When scorched pages {{had been replaced by}} fresh ones she would send the revised manuscript to the publisher she had met at St. Barnabas, the one who had witnessed the withstayed tragedy in the mission. She believed that her new friend could appreciate the significance of a book written by one who not only criticised expertly, but knew as well the human side of a great cathedral. Her thoughts went back to a time when Philip--a priest--had outlined plans for the noble church he hoped to build. Then nothing seemed too big for his young city. Isabel smiled, and began to read once more.|$|E
60|$|Hannibal, though fallen, {{retained}} {{still in}} Carthage {{some portion of}} his former power. The glory of his past exploits still invested his character {{with a sort of}} halo, which made him an object of general regard, and he still had great and powerful friends. He was elevated to high office, and exerted himself to regulate and improve the internal affairs of the state. In these efforts he was not, however, very successful. The historians say that the objects which he aimed to accomplish were good, and that the measures for effecting them were, in themselves, judicious; but, accustomed as he was to the authoritative and <b>arbitrary</b> <b>action</b> of a military commander in camp, he found it hard to practice that caution and forbearance, and that deference for the opinion of others, which are so essential as means of influencing men in the management of the civil affairs of a commonwealth. He made a great many enemies, who did every thing in their power, by plots and intrigues, as well as by open hostility, to accomplish his ruin.|$|E
50|$|The {{lack of a}} Congress, the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>actions</b> of the Emperor, and {{the absence}} of {{solutions}} to the serious problems that the country was facing, increased conspiracies to change the imperial system.

50|$|During the American Civil War (1861-1865), the Copperheads {{nominally}} {{favored the}} Union and strongly opposed the war, {{for which they}} blamed abolitionists, and they demanded immediate peace and resisted draft laws.

40|$|Recent Libet-style {{experiments}} are of limited {{relevance to the}} debate about free action and free will, and should be understood as investigations of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>actions</b> or guesses. In Libet-style experiments, the concept of 'free action' is commonly taken {{to refer to a}} 'self-initiated voluntary act', where the self prompts an action without being prompted. However, this idea is based on the problematic assumption that the conscious self needs to be free from every constraint in order to be actually free. We maintain that a fundamental condition for free action is the presence of reasons to act responsibly. By analyzing a recent neuroscientific experiment, we indicate how its results could be interpreted as indicating how free action operationalization is inappropriately focusing on <b>arbitrary</b> <b>actions.</b> Hence, the way free action has been experimentally studied may have had a misleading influence on the debate about free will...|$|R
