Along with {{the claims of the}} borough as set out in the original petition, the delegation made two more points: Leeds was the only university town not <b>a</b> <b>city,</b> <b>and</b> Leeds and Sheffield were the only boroughs returning five MPs to the House of Commons without the status (of a city).|$|E
5|$|Bristol is both <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>and</b> {{a county}}, since Edward III granted it a county charter in 1373. The county was {{expanded}} in 1835 to include suburbs such as Clifton, {{and it was}} named a county borough in 1889 when that designation was introduced. On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon. The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>and</b> for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal {{allies of the}} K'iche' Maya. The growing power of the Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines. Iximche developed quickly as <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>and</b> within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held the real power.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The threat to {{the site was}} one of the first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in <b>a</b> <b>city,</b> <b>and</b> the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, Plymouth has {{experienced}} rapid growth and development. As in many South Shore towns, Plymouth became {{more accessible to}} Boston in the early 1970s with improved railroads, highways, and bus routes. Furthermore, the town's inexpensive land costs and low tax rates were factors in the town's significant population rise. Plymouth's population grew from 18,606 residents in 1970 to 45,608 residents in 1990, a 145% increase in 20 years. The population has continued to expand in recent years. While Plymouth has already surpassed several Massachusetts cities in population, the town is still officially regarded as a town, as {{it has not been}} re-chartered as <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>and</b> continues to be governed by a board of selectmen rather than a mayor. Plymouth has emerged as a major economic and tourist center of the South Shore.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom is {{historically}} significant {{as a historical}} reminder of the pivotal time in which Pawtucket was incorporated as <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>and</b> gave up its town-meeting form of governance. The building is also architecturally significant as a rare type of building, wardrooms, {{and is one of}} three extant examples in Rhode Island. William R. Walker & Son constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the First Ward Wardroom being extant and the third example having been demolished. Though both constructed by William R. Walker & Son, the two Pawtucket wardrooms are related, but not identical in construction and show variations by the firm. Another wardroom, with a bungalow style, is located in the Cato Hill Historic District in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The Fifth Ward Wardroom was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Leeds, <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>and</b> metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England, encompasses {{a wide range}} of architectural styles and notable buildings. As with most northern industrial centres, much of Leeds' prominent architecture is of the Victorian era. However, the City of Leeds also contains buildings from as early as the Middle Ages such as Kirkstall Abbey, one of Britain's best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries, as well as examples of 20th century industrial architecture, particularly in the districts of Hunslet and Holbeck.|$|E

5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>and</b> gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E
