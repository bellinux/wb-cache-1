25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine to get <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and {{most parts of the}} frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones {{was not part of the}} normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{commonly}} accepted {{understanding that the}} raison d’etre of the five stories comprising A Hero of Our Time by Mikhail Lermontov {{is to take the}} readers closer to the protagonist of the novel. In fact, as the narrative progresses, the reader comes to have <b>an</b> increasingly <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Pechorin, the hero of the novel. This paper aims at unraveling the structural principle of “Pechorin’s Diary,” consisting of “Taman’,” “Princess Mary, and “The Fatalist. ” Since the theme of fate runs through “Pechorin’s Diary,” I analyze the use of the keywords “fate,” along with “predestination. ” As a result of the examination, {{it turns out that the}} protagonist is indeed obsessed with “fate” and his actions can be viewed from the perspective of his ambivalent interpretation of fate. More importantly, the three stories of “Pechorin’s Diary” reveal the tendency of attributing Pechorin with the sense of omniscience and omnipotence. While Pechorin is described to be lucky in averting a life-threatening scheme against him in “Taman’,” he assumes a role of both agent and victim of fate in his plots against Grushnitsky and Mary in the next story. Pechorin’s image with regard to fate reaches its climax in the final story “The Fatalist,” in which he not only reads someone else’s predestination, but authors it for himself. This final stage of the protagonist’s self-fashioning image reminds the reader of Lermontov’s another masterpiece The Demon. clos...|$|R
