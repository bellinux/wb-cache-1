Without the high resolve of youth, without the {{constant}} accession of youth, without recuperative power, no sustained forward movement is possible in the world. It is to youth, therefore, that this book is finally addressed, to the adolescents, to the students, to those who are yet in the schools and who will presently come to read it, to those who being still plastic can understand the infinite plasticity of the world. It is those who are yet unmade who must become the makers. After thirty there are few conversions and fewer fine beginnings; men and women go on in the path they have marked out for themselves. Their imaginations have become firm and rigid even if they have not withered, and there is no turning them from the conviction of their brief experience that almost all that is, is inexorably so. Accomplished things obsess us more and more. What man or woman over thirty in Great Britain dares to hope for a republic before it is time to die? Yet the thing might be. Or for the reunion of the English- speaking peoples? Or for the deliverance of all of our blood and speech from those fouler things than chattel slavery, child and <b>adolescent</b> <b>labour?</b> Or for an infantile death-rate under ninety in the thousand and all that would mean in the common life? These and a hundred such things are coming now, but only the young know how near they may be brought to us. As for us others, we plant a tree never believing we shall eat the fruit, we build a house never hoping to live therein. The desert, we believe in our hearts, is our home and our destined grave, and whatever we see of the Promised Land we must see {{through the eyes of the}} young.|$|E

The list was expanded in 2006, and again in 2008.

Further, adolescents between 14-18 years {{will not be allowed to}} work in hazardous industries and processes.|$|E

40|$|Switzerland {{is famous}} for its {{vocational}} education and training (VET) system. This article describes Switzerland's success in integrating <b>adolescents</b> into the <b>labour</b> market, with emphasis on two aspects. First, dual-track VET, which combines learning at school and in host companies, is an attractive choice for adolescents. It prepares them for the labour market and for progression routes to higher education. Second, the firm's decision to train could be an example of the prisoner's dilemma, but Switzerland has managed to sidestep that issue and minimize concerns about poaching. Finally, we discuss what Spain could learn from the Swiss VET system...|$|R
40|$|Anxiety is {{a normal}} human phenomenon. It is {{fundamental}} to our survival as a species, allowing us to adjust and {{plan for the future}} and prompts us to seek help and security from others. High levels of anxiety during childbearing are associated with poor fetal development, behavioural/emotional problems in children and <b>adolescents,</b> prolonged <b>labours,</b> increased obstetric intervention, impaired lactogenesis and bonding problems. Working with highly anxious childbearing women can be a challenging experience for independent lead maternity care midwives. This qualitative investigation guided by the principles of feminist research examined four independent midwives experiences of working with highly anxious childbearing women. Data were collected by interview, and thematic analysis found three themes that encapsulated the experience. The resultant themes were of: 1) challenging partnerships, 2) making a difference and 3) realising own limitations. The midwives, while very committed to their highly anxious clients, experienced considerable stress while endeavouring to provide effective care. This stress is of concern to midwives and midwifery as it makes midwives vulnerable to burnout. Given the damage that high levels of unchecked anxiety have on childbearing women and their families, midwifery has to look for safe and effective ways to work with these women. Recommendations for practice are based around negotiating boundaries to the midwife-client relationship, increased help and support for midwives, especially clinical supervision, better midwifery education, and continuous professional development in relation to maternal mental health, and properly resourced and funded maternal mental health services...|$|R
40|$|Labour force {{participation}} of adolescents in Australia {{is growing at}} an unprecedented rate. This increased participation is coupled with a growing realisation of the vulnerability of <b>adolescents</b> in the <b>labour</b> market in terms of occupational injury. Despite recent evidence that time of day {{may be an important}} determinant of adolescent injuries, the impact of non-standard and night work on adolescent injury rates has received scant attention to date. The current study addresses this shortcoming by examining injury patterns of 3201 working adolescents in Queensland. Results revealed that female adolescents are 2. 5 times more likely to sustain an injury on day shift and 4. 71 times more likely to sustain an injury on night shift than their adult counterparts when total work hours are taken into consideration. Similar results were found for male adolescents with an injury to work hours ratio of 2. 19 on day shift and 3. 05 on night shift. These findings point to the value of considering the temporal pattern of adolescent work in future research aimed at minimising injuries at work and improving the work experience of tomorrow's workforce.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{issues related to the}} {{academic}} discussion on child and <b>adolescent</b> <b>labour</b> and its consequences for the school failure of disadvantaged children, seeking to identify socially centred ideological positions and methodological flaws that lead to a reduction in the complexity of the problem. Evidence of this reduction {{is to be found in}} two false assumptions: a) a linear relation between the variables, ignoring the mediations involved; and b) a homogenisation of those categories, disregarding the vast array of internal variations. Research supporting this questioning is presented, indicating some of the consequences of those reductionist postures on school practices and on the cognitive and affective development of underage workers. Among those factors that need to be considered in the discussion of the relations between early work and school trajectory, the following are stressed: the mediations represented by the diverse instances of exclusion that perpetuate poverty, the heterogeneity of child and adolescent work, and the role attributed to poor families with regard to school failure and to early insertion of their children in the world of work...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 182 - 190. The thesis {{examines}} adolescent {{experience on}} two grape-growing {{farms in the}} Western Cape. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the daily lives of farm residents with special reference to adolescents and the power relations between farmers and farm residents and between males and females insofar as they affect adolescents. The current literature on conditions on white-owned farms in South Africa lacks detailed research at the micro-level. This thesis begins to fill the gaps in the literature by providing an understanding of how people on the farms pursue their day-to-day lives. Six months intensive fieldwork was conducted on two farms in the Western Cape. During this time participant observation was supplemented by a household survey, the correction of life-histories and interviews with farm residents. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>labour</b> was documented in both summer and winter by using observations, 24 -hour recalls and instant checks. An important theme which recurs throughout the thesis is that of the entrapment and encapsulation of farm residents. I show that despite the fact that different people - men, women and adolescent girls and boys - have different options for resisting the constraints of farm existence, they remain trapped in the valley with few alternative opportunities for employment elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Pretendemos {{discutir}} o trabalho doméstico de adolescentes na perspectiva das relações de gênero, articulando-o com as categorias de classe social, etnia e intergeracionalidade. Utilizamos os resultados de uma pesquisa realizada em Natal (RN), a qual destaca que as jovens começam a trabalhar muito cedo, acumulando tarefas escolares e de trabalho e sob condições trabalhistas desiguais, com baixos salários, muitas horas e a presença de trabalho noturno, o que é proibido para menores de 18 anos. Trata-se de uma forma de trabalho desvalorizada, rotineira e desestimulante. Além disso, reproduz muitos conflitos sociais, principalmente aqueles relacionados a gênero, já que é uma forma de perpetuar o espaço doméstico como destinado à figura feminina, reproduzindo a divisão sexual do trabalho. Apesar disso, tem um sentido positivo na vida das jovens, pois é uma forma de ascensão social, de ter mais autonomia, bem como ajudar suas famílias que se encontram, geralmente, no interior do estado. We {{intend to}} discuss <b>adolescent</b> domestic <b>labour</b> using a gender relationship perspective while linking {{it to the}} categories of social class, ethnicity and intergenerationality. We use data of a study conducted in Natal (RN), that points out that young women initiate work early in their lives thereby accumulating school and job tasks. The working conditions are unequal, exemplified by low pay, extensive work periods, and night shifts which is prohibited for those under 18 years of age. This type of work is undervalued, routine, and unstimulating. It reproduces many social conflicts, especially those related to gender, for it {{is a form of}} perpetuating the designation of the domestic space to the feminine figure thereby reproducing the sexual division of labour. In spite of that, however, this type of work has a positive meaning for these young women. They view it as a form of social ascension, of gaining autonomy, and of helping their families that live in the interior of the state...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{critical}} assessment of anti- child trafficking discourse, policy and practice, using {{a case study}} of the situation in Southern Benin. It seeks to achieve two main goals. First, to transcend the reductiveness of the dominant paradigm around child trafficking, including dominant representations of it and prevailing policy approaches to dealing with it. Second, to complicate the simplistic nature of much of the academic literature that explains the existence and persistence of this dominant paradigm. Based on 14 months of multi-sited fieldwork, the thesis demonstrates, first, that the institutional narrative of ‘child trafficking’ misrepresents what would be better understood as <b>adolescent</b> <b>labour</b> migration in Benin, and second, that mainstream policy approaches to tackling this fail to account for the sociocultural or political-economic conditions that underpin it. The thesis suggests that this can be interpreted {{as a result of the}} power of three framing orders of discourse – ‘Apollonian Childhood’, Neoliberalism and that of the Westphalian State – which structure both what ‘trafficking’ can mean and what can be done about it. The thesis suggests that the material and power structures of the anti-trafficking discourse- and policy-making field are such that, even where individuals within it reject both the dominant paradigm and its (and the field’s) framing orders of discourse, little space exists for them to construct meaningful alternatives. The result is a degree of formal and representational stability, hiding practical hybridity. The conclusion is offered that, while anti-trafficking discourse is presumed to be accurate and while antitrafficking policy is justified in terms of its contribution to ‘beneficiaries’, theprinciple achievement of both is the depoliticised reproduction of the institutions, orders of discourse and political-economic context within which they are constructed. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
40|$|By {{the late}} eighteenth century, enslaved {{children}} and young adults had become vital components in the reproduction of Caribbean slavery. Yet the experiences of enslaved children and adolescents have rarely been the focus of scholarship. Indeed, the near-absence of scholarship on enslaved children and youth within the historiographies of slavery, childhood and family history is striking. While we know much about the structure of family life, gender roles, courtship, marriage, and parenting among the enslaved, we know far less about the material worlds of enslaved youth and adolescents. Childhood and adolescence represented critical stages in the lives of enslaved children for it was during these life-stages that young people were inculcated with the racialised ideologies of the wider social order, gained insight into the value systems of their society, were socialized into acceptance of their status as unfree peoples, and prepared for their future roles as labourers. Hence, their experiences of slavery were qualitatively different from those of adult slaves. This paper explores some aspects of adolescent life on the Jamaican estate of Thomas Thistlewood in the late decades of the eighteenth century. Thistlewood, manager of a slave-pen, early recognised the importance of young people in furthering his ambitions to become master of his own estate, and his purchases of young people reflect that market-rational strategy. Thistlewood’s preference for a youthful labour force stemmed from his conviction that young people could be more easily made to submit to his authority than adult slaves. Yet, Thistlewood’s belief in the greater tractability of enslaved youth was often undermined, as his <b>adolescent</b> <b>labour</b> force frequently and forcefully tested the limits of his mastery and asserted their rights to freedom. Thistlewood’s journal not only offers rich insights into the processes of transformation of enslaved children to adolescents and mature adults, but it also sheds light on enslaved youth and their negotiations with, manipulations of, and resistance to the master–slave relationship. This paper argues then, that far from being the passive objects of planter mastery, enslaved youth were active agents in the shaping of their own histories. In exploring these issues, this paper reveals much of the contradictions and ambiguities of enslaved childhood, youth and adolescence. ...|$|E
