5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E

5|$|In {{international}} {{public opinion}} surveys {{there is strong}} support {{for a variety of}} methods for addressing the problem of energy supply.

It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.|$|E
5|$|In short, the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical rudder. Its role was not to change the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E
