5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Outbreaks of diarrhoea, {{haemolytic}} uraemic {{syndrome and}} food poisoning {{have been associated}} with the consumption of (apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> ciders) <b>and</b> (apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices).</b> The organisms implicated in these outbreaks have been Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and Salmonella typhi (a group D serotype), indicating the resistance of the serotypes of these organisms to acidic pH. The acid tolerance, the growth, and the survival of these organisms were investigated in both natural (unpasteurized, untreated) and pasteurized, treated apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders. The effects of benzoic acid, as a preservative, on the growth of the mentioned bacteria subjected to examination, in trypticase soy broth <b>and</b> apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders were also examined. It was evident that E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) organisms grew well in trypticase soy broth at pH level ranging from 3. 0 to 9. 0. The growth of both mentioned serotypes were inhibited by adding 0. 05 % of benzoic acid. Similarly, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. typhi strains grew well in both natural (unpasteurized) as well as in pasteurized apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders, and the growth was inhibited by adding 0. 1 % of benzoic acid. The possible sources of contamination of natural apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders with E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) are discussed. The study declared the efficacy of acids, their salts and derivatives in controlling microbial growth in food in general.

The band were able to take their time with the recording and to employ guest musicians including Mike McEvoy and Joe Cang because their label Rough Trade paid each member a salary of £50 per week, as well as giving them a generous advance to record the album. Gartside explained that the album had taken several months to make because [...] "a lot of the ideas for this album, particularly lyrically, weren't finalised by the time we went into the studio, so we decided to do a couple of days at a time. Also, we were working with Adam Kidron, who was at the time committed to Delta Five [...] and Pere Ubu <b>and</b> <b>Orange</b> <b>Juice,</b> so it took that much longer to complete.

[...] Atta said, [...] "I have plenty of money. I'm a pilot." [...] And he hauled a wad of $50 and $100 bills from his pocket, eventually leaving a $3 tip. However, Atta flew on US Airways Flight 2719 to Baltimore at approximately 3:15 p.m. on September 7 from Fort Lauderdale, and therefore could not have been at Shuckum's that evening. On September 8, Atta was in Laurel, Maryland, where he went to a Safeway grocery store to wire $2850 to Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad in Dubai, and sent another $5000 to Ahmed from a Giant Food store in Laurel on the same day.

A laboratory scale continuous flow PL system was set up for the experiments, using a xenon flash-lamp emitting high intensity light in the range of 100 – 1100 nm. The flashes lasted 360 μs at a constant frequency of 3 Hz. The results highlighted how the lethal effect of pulsed light depended on the energy dose supplied, the absorption properties of liquid food as well as the bacterial strain examined. The higher the quantity of the energy delivered to the juice stream, the greater the inactivation level. However, the absorbance of the inoculated juice strongly influenced the dose deliver and, therefore, the efficiency of the PL treatment. Among the bacteria tested, E. coli cells showed a greater {{susceptibility to}} the PL treatment than L. innocua cells in both apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices.</b> Following treatment at 4 J/cm 2, microbial reductions in apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> were, respectively, 4. 00 and 2. 90 Log-cycles for E. coli and 2. 98 and 0. 93 Log-cycles for L. innocua.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that oxidant/antioxidant imbalance triggers cell damage that in turn causes a number of lung diseases. Flavonoids are known for their health benefits, and Citrus fruits juices are one of the main food sources of these secondary plant metabolites. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of the flavonoid fraction of bergamot <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices,</b> on H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in human lung epithelial A 549 cells. First we tested the antioxidant properties of both extracts in cell-free experimental models and then we assayed their capability to prevent the cytotoxic effects induced by H 2 O 2. Our results demonstrated that both Citrus juice extracts reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species and membrane lipid peroxidation, improve mitochondrial functionality, and prevent DNA-oxidative damage in A 549 cells incubated with H 2 O 2. Our data indicate that the mix of flavonoids present in both bergamot <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> may be of use in preventing oxidative cell injury and pave the way for further research into a novel healthy approach to avoid lung disorders...|$|R

Eleven healthy volunteers were studied over a 3 -week period consisting of 5 study days each separated by a three-day washout. All subjects refrained from drinking caffeine containing beverages (coffee, soda, etc.) 8 h before orally taking DM (30 mg) with 200 ml water, 200 ml grapefruit juice, 200 ml water, 200 ml seville <b>orange</b> <b>juice,</b> <b>and</b> 200 ml water on Study Days 1 to 5. Aliquots of urine samples were assayed and analysed for DM, and the DM metabolites dextrorphan, 3 -methoxymorphinan and 3 -hydroxymorphinan using a validated HPLC method employing a phenyl column and a fluorescence detection. Results suggests that DM could provide some useful information on P-glycoprotein or related membrane efflux protein activity in the human gastro-intestinal tract.

Materials and methodsThe materials included resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Vitremer 3 M™ ESPE™ Core buildup restorative) and composite resin (Filtek™ 3 M™ ESPE™ Z 350). A total of 45 disks of each restorative material were prepared. The disks were divided into groups of 15, which were immersed for 7 days in deionized water (G 1 /G 4, control group), apple juice (G 2 /G 5), or <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> (G 3 /G 6). The pH of the apple juice was approximately 4. 8 and the pH of the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> was approximately 4. 9. Surface hardness tests were performed before immersion and at various times following immersion. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA with repeated measurement and Tukey’s test. ResultsExposure to juices significantly reduced the hardness of both materials (p< 0. 05), while deionized water did not affect the surface hardness of either material.
