5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{is found in}} forests from sea-level up to , but is most common in hills and low mountains. A social bird, it lives in family groups and {{frequently}} joins and even leads mixed-species foraging flocks. The diet {{is made up of}} fruits, seeds and invertebrates. This species is apparently a cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> young. The hooded pitohui is common and not at risk of extinction.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E

5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> chicks on other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E
5|$|Most Apus swift species nest {{in rocky}} areas, and the {{majority}} will accept human habitations {{as a substitute for}} natural sites. The Pacific swift is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5x16–17mm (0.95–1.08x0.63–0.67in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5days.|$|E

5|$|The clutch is {{two to five}} {{eggs that}} are white with brownish, ruddy or grey blotches {{particularly}} at the wide end. The egg size ranges from an average 20.2x14.0mm (0.80x0.55in) with a weight of 2.08g (0.073oz) for the Eurasian crag martin to 17.7x13.0mm (0.70x0.51in) with a weight of 1.57g (0.06oz) for the dusky crag martin. Both adults incubate the eggs for 13–19 days to hatching, <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24–27 days later. The fledged young continue to be fed by the parents for some time after they can fly.|$|E
5|$|The clutch {{is usually}} {{two or three}} buff-white eggs blotched with sepia or grey-brown, {{particularly}} at the wide end. The average egg size for Asian birds was 19.3x12.9mm (0.76x0.51in) with a weight of 1.7g (0.06oz). Both adults incubate the eggs for 16–19 days prior to hatching <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly. The fledging time can vary from 22–24days to 25–30days, though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food. If a nest is destroyed, or the breeding attempt otherwise fails, a replacement clutch may be laid, typically with fewer eggs. Two nests in Arabia were used in spring {{and again in the}} autumn, but it is not known if the same pair were involved.|$|E
5|$|The house martins nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings, {{constructing}} feather- or grass-lined mud nests. The typical clutch is two {{or three}} white eggs; both parents build the nest, incubate the eggs <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> chicks. These martins are aerial hunters of small insects such as flies and aphids. Despite their flying skills the Delichon martins are sometimes caught by fast-flying birds of prey. They may carry fleas or internal parasites. None of the species are considered threatened, although widespread reductions in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe. This decline is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites.|$|E

5|$|This martin nests under a cliff {{overhang}} or on {{a man-made}} structure, building a neat half-cup mud nest {{with a soft}} lining. Both adults incubate the two to four eggs <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, {{but it is more}} gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as the martin flies near to cliff faces. It may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey, but its extensive and expanding range and large population mean that there are no significant conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|This sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of herbs and grains, but it also eats berries and insects, {{particularly}} during the breeding season. This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. In some parts of its range, the russet sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. Its nest {{is located in a}} tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. The male chooses the nest site before finding a mate and uses the nest for courtship display. The typical clutch contains five or six whitish eggs. Both sexes incubate <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> young.|$|E
