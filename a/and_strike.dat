However, if bargaining takes place at the firm-level, then wages <b>and</b> <b>strikes</b> are increasing with the degree of product differentiation, <b>and</b> the <b>strike</b> activity is smaller under Bertrand than under Cournot competition...|$|R

5|$|After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Nevin and catcher Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels, where Collins was manager, {{for minor}} league player Nick Skuse. After {{an injury to}} {{starting}} catcher Todd Greene, Collins gave Nevin the opportunity {{to compete for the}} starting job with Walbeck.

5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} in western Cuba, causing flash flooding and severe damage. The storm damaged 8,745houses and destroyed 154buildings, leaving hundreds homeless. Heavy rainfall {{continued in the}} country for several weeks after the storm, and damage from Alberto totaled about $85million (1982USD, $ USD). At least 23people were killed in the country. Initially, Alberto was forecast to continue northeastward <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> Florida, though it turned and rapidly weakened, resulting in minor effects in the state.|$|E
5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E

5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump in the air <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|In King Arthur and King Cornwall, the Green Knight again {{features}} as Bredbeddle, and {{is depicted as}} one of Arthur's knights. He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious sprite (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber. When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> off its master's head.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the {{heaviest}} workload, bowling nearly 200 overs {{more than any}} other squad member. He was the leading wicket-taker in all first-class matches with 102 wickets at 16.42, and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on a tour of England. His average was only slightly inferior to that of Lindwall, who took 86 wickets at 15.68. The roles Johnston fulfilled are borne out in his economy rate <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> rate. He was more economical than Miller and Lindwall, who took wickets more frequently.|$|E

With the bat, Lindwall scored 191 runs at a batting average of 31.83 in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Mine owners {{still holding}} out for the 10-hour day soon {{attempted}} to re-open their mines. On March 14, they obtained a court injunction ordering the miners not {{to interfere with the}} operation of their mines, and hired strikebreakers. The WFM initially attempted to persuade these men to join the union <b>and</b> <b>strike,</b> but when they were unsuccessful, the union resorted to threats and violence. These tactics succeeded in driving non-union miners out of the district.|$|E

On May 7, 2010, Universal Pictures announced it had agreed to finance and distribute the film, which Roth <b>and</b> <b>Strike</b> Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman would produce. The producers gave RZA a $20 million budget.|$|E

5|$|The Air Combat Group (ACG) {{was created}} on 1 January 2002 with {{the merging of}} two Force Element Groups (FEGs), Strike Reconnaissance Group (F-111) and Tactical Fighter Group (F/A-18 Hornet, Hawk and PC-9A). The ACG was tasked to deliver the core {{capabilities}} of Control of the Air and Precision Air Strike {{with the hope that}} it would allow the RAAF to more quickly deploy its combat aircraft. Although the fighter <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> elements will continue to operate as discrete units for some time, ACG will provide the opportunity for the RAAF to test the organisation required to deliver a range of combat capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force's Air Combat Group (ACG) is {{the group}} which administers the RAAF's fighter and bomber aircraft.

5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track to the west <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> the United States. One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North Carolina to Watch Hill, Rhode Island and {{from the mouth of}} the Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm warning area.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} the Khawarij met in Mecca and {{discussed}} the 659 Battle of Nahrawan, at which former supporters of Ali had rebelled against him for agreeing to discuss {{the leadership of the}} community with Muawiyah. They agreed to assassinate three of the leaders of Islam: ibn Muljam, a Jewish convert to Islam was to kill Ali, al-Hujjaj al-Tamimi was to kill Muawiya, and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi was to kill 'Amr ibn al-'As. The assassination attempts were to occur simultaneously as the three leaders came to lead morning prayer in their respective cities of Damascus, Fustat and Kufa. The method was {{to come out of the}} prayer ranks <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> the targets with a sword dipped in poison.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Gamede {{remained}} a broad system, and by February 24 it produced winds of near gale force up to 670km (415mi) southeast of its center; {{later in the}} day, it passed about 300km (190mi) north of Réunion, its closest point of approach to the island. For over 90hours, the cyclone remained within 400km (250mi) of the island, resulting in torrential rainfall in the island's mountainous region. Radar imagery on the island indicated Gamede maintained an eye diameter of 60–70km (37–43mi). After tracking generally southwestward for several days, a building ridge to its south changed {{the motion of the}} cyclone to the west before it became quasi-stationary. Initially, it was predicted to continue westward <b>and</b> <b>strike</b> Madagascar near Toamasina. The cyclone re-intensified while executing a small loop, and late on February 25 Gamede officially attained peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) about halfway between Réunion island and the coast of Madagascar; at the time, wind gusts in association with the storm reached 230km/h (135mph).|$|E
5|$|From the north, Warsaw, which {{spans the}} Vistula, was {{effectively}} shielded by the Vistula, Bug and Narew rivers.

While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the Warsaw Fortress, ran mostly along {{the western side of}} the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of their withdrawal from Warsaw in 1915, during the First World War.|$|E
