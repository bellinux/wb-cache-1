40|$|To Tweet or Not to Tweet? That’s not {{necessarily}} the question, but it’s one I’ve been pondering for a while. On the one hand, I’m loath to add another new form of communication to my life. After all, blogging is only something I’ve been doing for a bit over a year. On the other hand, as I argue in a commentary about blogs that I’m hoping {{will be published in}} the next couple of months (in paper format—as it is aimed at people still skeptical about online writing), things change so fast in the digital world that we need to reckon time like dog years these days, which means it’s already been about a decade since I embraced the blogging life. In addition, Rebecca MacKinnon and Jeremy Goldkorn, two of the people whose views on such matters I value most highly, have just made good cases for giving Twitter its due. I learned of Rebecca’s views via that most old-fashioned of communication formats, a face-to-face conversation (admittedly illustrated by show and tell on her laptop) we had at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong earlier this week before taking the stage together for a public dialogue on blogs (more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> later post perhaps). She described the way that (as a reader) “tweets” by others can help her get a sense of what’s happening on the ground in China, while (as a writer) her twittering can assist others who strive to stay up to date on various things (even where and when events she’s involved in like our Literary Festival gig are taking place). I learned of Jeremy’s take in a more high-tech way: by reading his website (one that I keep up with via an RSS feed, a wonderfully useful method for staying abreast of Danwei or for that matter China Beat, which as many but not all people reading this know isn’t hard to set up at all via Google Reader). He claimed Twitter was perfect for haiku-like mini-reviews of “really bad books,” using this tweet to illustrate his point: “Just finished ‘The Black Swan’ by Nassim Nicholas Talib.

40|$|Gradovi srednje Dalmacije: Split, Trogir, Kaštela, Hvar, kao i Korčula i Orebić, baštine tradicijsku odjeću koja se, iako pripada urbanim sredinama, smatra narodnom nošnjom. Narodna nošnja je tradicijski način odijevanja koji se kroz duže vremensko razdoblje koristi na određenom geografskom području, a određuju je karakteristični odjevni predmeti, vrste materijala, boje, vezovi, ukrasi i nakit. Činjenica da se tradicijski stil odijevanja u spomenutim gradovima održao do početka 20. st., bez obzira na vanjske utjecaje, proširuje pojam narodne nošnje sa seoskih i na gradske sredine. Nošnje spomenutog područja pripadaju jadranskoj etnografskoj zoni, točnije njenom građanskom tipu. U biti je ova nošnja zakašnjeli oblik odijevanja zapadne Europe, koja je do naših priobalnih i otočkih mjesta došla dijelom i s istoka, zahvaljujući pomorskim i trgovačkim vezama sa zemljama Mediterana. The {{traditional}} {{style of}} clothing {{which was used}} {{over an extended period}} of time in certain geographical areas is called national costume. Clothing has been an identifying factor for man since the cave-dwelling times when he covered himself with animal skins. In truth, clothes do not make a man, but they do reveal something about him. In many cases clothes tell us which climatic area a person comes from, how he is placed economically, what his social status is, how much taste he has, what times and artistic style he belongs to, and often his ethnic origins. The urban style of clothing described here is that of the towns of central Dalmatia: Split, Hvar, Kaštela and Trogir, also from Korčula and Orebić. It dates from the middle of the 19 th century, and in most of the towns was preserved up to the Second World War. This region belongs to the Adriatic ethnographic zone within which clothing belongs to the urban style of dress. This urban style is a late version of European 19 th century fashion, which came to these parts through maritime links and trading, and emanated from east and west. Quite often the clothes are stitched from imported materials, with decorative edgings, lace and various embellishments (jewellery, fans, hats and other decorative elements). Venice had the greatest influence on how people dressed in this region, both in style and in the use of colour and decoration. Many influences, especially in menswear, came from the east, such as the knee breeches called “brageše” which emerged in Dubrovnik, Hvar and Krk, each place having its specific version. This was also the case for the long cylindrical headgear, known as the levantine cap, which was characteristic on Hvar. Also from the east was the long sash which held in the men’s nautical style trousers and the white shirt with stitched collar and gathered cuffs which was worn in this region from renaissance times. The costumes of the region underwent an interesting linking of influences. Women’s clothing was influenced by Venice and later by Spain in the Counter-Reformation, so it was more of the aristocratic, town type, whereas the men’s was more influenced from the east or the Dalmatian hinterland (Split, Trogir, or Kaštela male dress with the characteristic red cap which differs very slightly different from place to place). This conjunction of urban and rural influences would lead one to expect a mismatch between male and female dress styles, but this was not so. On the contrary, the admixture of different influences created exceptional harmony in the costumes of this area. Even though the towns were open to outside influences through their overseas and mainland links, almost all of them took on those influences and modified them according to their own particular traditions and taste. That is how it came <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relatively small geographical area, there were several really elegant town costumes which were very similar in style, and yet were individual and different from each other...|$|E
