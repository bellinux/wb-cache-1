500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} {{for the first}} issue, David Pepose of Newsarama wrote, [...] "The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> him quickly. Even though we're still {{scratching}} the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher. But that kind of Parker-style guilt—that neurotic, nearly masochistic tendency for self-sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility—is still intact." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that [...] "Miles still feels like {{a bit of an}} outsider in his own book. Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles—his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." [...] Schedeen also opined that [...] "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's". James Hunt of CBR.com rated the issue #1 four and a half out of five stars, lauding Bendis for emphasizing Morales' character and his supporting cast instead of rushing him into costume. The first issue holds a score of 7.8 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on 11 reviews, while the final issue, #28, holds a score of 8.3, based on 9 reviews, and the series overall holds an average issue rating of 8.3.|$|E

Award-winning author Nancy Kress writes [...] "Michael Bishop has pulled off a rare and amazing feat. [...] Unicorn Mountain successfully weaves such traditional fantasy elements as unicorns and Indian lore together with the all-too-contemporary..." [...] Orson Scott Card writes [...] "The triumph of this, Bishop's most artistically whole and successful novel to date, is that {{he set out to}} do something that is nearly impossible in fiction: He wrote a novel about constructing a tribe...To do it, he had to bring us to know and understand <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> more created characters than most writers produce in a career." [...] John Clute's assessment emphasizes another theme of the work: [...] "Michael Bishop, whose voice is like a shout {{from the bottom of the}} well of the enormous South, and whose heart is on his sleeve, [...] in Unicorn Mountain to generate a moving tale out of ecological disaster here and in another world, AIDS, the death of cultures, the death of species, and the slow sea-changing of America into themeparks." [...] The novel would go on to win the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and was shortlisted for the 1989 Locus Award.|$|E
2500|$|Jackman first created {{three pieces}} of music for {{directors}} Anthony and Joe Russo: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute suite for the Winter Soldier; and a track representing Hydra. Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having [...] "enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, {{but not so much}} that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant", and stated that in the third act [...] "the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [...] to come through". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace [...] "those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic", such as when the character visits his own Smithsonian exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland. Jackman described the Winter Soldier as [...] "a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be [...] "inappropriate ... instead [...] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records." [...] In the Winter Soldier suite, [...] "the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral." [...] Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of [...] "tortured, time-stretched human cries of someone who has been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time but you can still hear the human in there". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more [...] "revealed {{toward the end of the}} film" [...] as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> him. When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, [...] "I really want to hear that in the movie and not just 20% of" [...] it. For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the [...] "Wagnerian symphonic baddie music" [...] of the first film, and [...] "come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary." [...] Jackman also introduces a motif for the Falcon.|$|E
2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked. It's not so much a 'whodunnit?' as a 'who-done-her?'" ...|$|E

In our day the {{majority}} of people who tell me about a play which they have seen, cannot tell me the name of the author. Yet it is usually printed on the playbill, though in modest type. The public does not care a straw about the author's name, unless he be deservedly famous for writing letters to the newspapers on things in general; for his genius as an orator; his enthusiasm as a moralist, or in any other extraneous way. Dr. Forman in his queer account of the plot of [...] "Mack Beth" [...] does not allude to the name of the author (April 20, 1610). Twelfth Night was not published till 1623, in the Folio: there was no quarto to enlighten Manningham about the author's name. We do not hear of printed playbills, with author's names inserted, at that period. It seems probable that occasional playgoers knew and cared no more about authors than they do at present. The world of the wits, the critics (such as Francis Meres), poets, playwrights, and players, did know <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the authors; apparently Manningham did not.
