25|$|Mannitol is {{commonly}} produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, {{the transformation of}} starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol.

Under ideal conditions the reaction produces only 50% of the alcohol and the carboxylic acid (it takes two aldehydes to produce one acid and one alcohol). [...] To avoid the low yields, {{it is more}} common to conduct the crossed Cannizzaro reaction, in which a sacrificial aldehyde is used in combination with a more valuable chemical. In this variation, the reductant is formaldehyde, which is oxidized to sodium formate and the other aldehyde chemical is reduced to the alcohol. In this scenario, {{each of the two}} separate aldehydes can be converted completely to its corresponding product rather than losing 50% of a single reactant to each of two different products. Thus, the yield of the valuable chemical is high, although the atom economy is still low.|$|E

As previously observed in pure water systems, all <b>alkaline</b> <b>reactions</b> displayed the same lignin model disappearance rate, verifying that quinone methide formation was the rate-determining step. The addition of methanol did not affect 13 -aryl ether fragmentation efficiency for model 1 in the case of HO-, HS-, and alkaline SO 3 - 2 additives. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) slowed the disappearance rate of 1 for neutral sulfite and acid bisulfite cases; 13 -aryl ether fragmentation was marginally enhanced with neutral sulfite. 13 -Aryl ether scission was significantly improved when methanol was added to a soda/AHQ system. The enhancement of fragmentation correlated with the amount of methanol present. Several other solvents also displayed a response similar to methanol. The observed synergism in the AHQ/solvent cases is probably related to the unique electron transfer (radical) chemistry of the AHQ system. The solvents may act as radical scavengers and deactivate reactive free radicals that interfere with AHQ species, and/or alter the oxidation and reduction potentials of AHQ and QM species. - 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{chemical}} durability and mechanical properties {{of a kind}} of alkali-proof basalt fiber BF-CMD- 01 and its reinforced F 46 epoxy resin matrix composites are presented. The basalt fiber was boiled in distilled water, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, respectively. Then the mass loss and strength change of the fibers were studied showing that the alkali resistance of the basalt fiber is better than acid resistance. The flexural properties and surface morphologies of the composites were investigated after being immersed in 8 kinds of chemical mediums for 15, 30 and 90 days. Due to the difference of basalt fiber resistance in two kinds of mediums, the composites corrosion behaviors differ greatly in acid and <b>alkaline</b> <b>reactions.</b> In acid mediums, the flexural strength and flexural modulus change in the same way. In alkaline mediums, the flexural modulus keeps close to the original value while the flexural strength declines gradually. Additionally, the mechanical properties of basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) and S- 2 glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) have been tested, and analyzed contrastively. The results show that the interface formed between basalt fiber and epoxy resin is better than that of glass fiber and epoxy resin.

50|$|For the pH of {{drinking}} water, the threshold value is 6.5 - 9.5. pH values outside the neutral range (pH 6.5 - 7.5) are principally critical, since they provide {{an indication of}} the corrosion behaviour of water. Slightly acidic water (pH 4 - 6.5) usually corrodes galvanized iron pipes, but also copper and asbestos cement pipes. This process is known as acid corrosion. Practical experience has shown that the use of unprotected steel pipes is only possible at neutral pH values. By lower pH values, the removal of the pure zinc layer is promoted. As a result of the dissolved salts and gases, natural cold waters usually show a slightly <b>alkaline</b> <b>reaction.</b> These properties are created by setting the equilibrium concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. Higher alkaline pH values (pH 9 - 14) in the presence of oxygen as an oxidant lead to so-called oxygen corrosion. To avoid the described acid or oxygen corrosion, buffer solutions are added to the raw water for drinking water production. By the pH-stabilizing effect of hypolimnetic aeration, the application of these buffer solutions can be reduced, thus reducing operating costs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe present work aims to {{investigate}} the action of associated iron species contained in lateritic clays in the strengthening process of "geomimetic" materials (compressive strength of 12 MPa). The starting products are a lateritic clay from Cameroon, fulvic acid and lime. The synthesis involves acidic and <b>alkaline</b> <b>reactions</b> followed by a curing period of 18 days at 60 °C under water-saturated atmosphere. Since goethite (α-FeOOH), hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) and ferrihydrite (5 Fe 2 O 3 * 9 H 2 O) are the main iron compounds in the raw clay, investigations {{have been carried out}} to identify to which extend each of these phases participates in the consolidation process. It appears that hematite and ferrihydrite may contribute to the consolidating mechanism since the as obtained "geomimetic" products exhibit characteristic compressive strength of 8. 3 and 4. 5 MPa respectively. Besides, the use of goethite leads to consolidated products with characteristic compressive strength of 6. 5 MPa. The strengthening is effective when the synthesis of iron species is performed separately (no direct precipitation onto kaolin particles). Moreover, among the various model samples tested, only those elaborated with goethite were resistant towards water seeping and wearing.
