2500|$|... 'The Christmas Tree' was {{supposed}} to {{have something to do with}} playing colors by light, but it was totally random as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> just absurd. -- Bruce Conner ...|$|E

60|$|Jabez's {{calculations}} {{could not}} have been far out, for it was just midnight, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> when we saw a flash right ahead.|$|E
6000|$|It was Sammy Jay's turn to grin, [...] "Just <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you any news, Reddy Fox! Just <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you any news!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Why, {{everybody}} knows that you are so smart that you find out everything {{as soon as it}} happens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{said the}} girl, with a troubled voice, [...] "and I don't {{know what to}} do about it. It don't seem <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her, and yet it's wrong to let her go on." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{she had any}} drawback, good girl, it was {{the idea}} of deserting me; but then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{honestly}} <b>tell</b> her, nobody need fear for my happiness, since Clarence was given back to me. And she believed, and was ready to go to China with her Lawrence.|$|R

60|$|I {{turned to}} the last page. As well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> it related to some publication, which he was recommending to {{religious}} persons of our way of thinking.|$|E
60|$|So far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> {{the night}} passed quietly. The next morning I heard that my {{mistress}} was suffering so severely from a nervous attack {{that she was}} unable to rise from her bed. It was no surprise to me to be told that, knowing as I did what she had gone through the night before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{broke it}} to her <b>as</b> gentle <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> didn’t <b>tell</b> ’er much, I just gave her a few ’ints. Just {{enough to make her}} ask for more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw him a {{few days}} before I came home, and found him more disconsolate than ever,--' just ready to go to the Devil,' as he {{forcibly}} expressed himself. I consoled the poor lad <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>telling</b> him his wisest plan was to defer his proposed expedition, and go on as steadily as he had begun,--thereby proving the injustice of your father's prediction concerning his want of perseverance, and the sincerity of his affection. I told him the change in Laura's health and spirits was silently working in his favor, and that a few more months of persistent endeavor would conquer your father's prejudice against him, and make him a stronger man for the trial and the pain. I read him bits about Laura from your own and Di's letters, and he went away at last as patient as Jacob ready to serve another 'seven years' for his beloved Rachel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My servant and I {{slept in}} a dormitory'--a {{thousand}} devils! monsieur, in a dormitory! Do you realize it? We had for company a drunken vintner, a pedlar, a pilgrim {{on his way to}} Rome, and two peasant women; and they sent us to bed without candles, for modesty's sake. I ask you to conceive my feelings in such a case <b>as</b> that. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you more; but that as a sample of what <b>I</b> have undergone <b>could</b> scarcely be surpassed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joan, I {{tell you}} it was a {{magnificent}} bluff," [...] went on Jim, excitedly. [...] "And it worked. Kells walked away amid cheers. He meant to give an impression of character and importance. He succeeded. So far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> there wasn't a man present who did not show admiration for him. I saw that dead gambler kicked." ...|$|E
60|$|Hooja {{called to}} Juag to stop {{when he saw}} that our craft was moving. He was much {{interested}} in the sail, and not a little awed, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by his shouted remarks and questions. Raising my head, I saw him plainly. He would have made an excellent target for one of my guns, and I had never been sorrier that I had lost them.|$|E
6000|$|... "This lady {{immediately}} began to ask me questions. She had perceived that I was a stranger, {{and she wanted to}} know where I came from, what was my business, and as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her of myself. 'I knew you were a scholar,' she said, 'because of your book, and I believe in scholars.' Then briefly she told me her story and what she wanted of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The prince told me, {{half an hour}} since. He {{heard it}} from the Admiral. He told me he wished he was going with you, instead of with the army. He is always thirsting after adventure. He bade me bring you in to him, if you came. I said you would be sure to do so. It was useless my going out to look for you, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what {{you might have to}} do before starting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You foolish man!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You do not understand. The {{days when}} I was Hildegarde, and Ulric was my lover, are as {{clear to me}} <b>as</b> moonlight. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you many things of those days if you cared to listen--how Ulric slew his brother because he lifted his eyes to me, and how once we were both taken prisoners by the King of East Mercia, and Ulric burst his bonds, the strongest they could forge, and slew the guards one by one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I remarked, [...] "all this proves nothing, since {{elephants}} certainly {{live for}} at least two hundred years, and perhaps much longer. Also, after they become 'rogues' they acquire every kind of wicked and unnatural habit, <b>as</b> to which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you lots of stories. Have you seen this elephant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{very sad}} affair." [...] Greythorpe mused. [...] "A {{promising}} career cut short {{and a life}} ruined by a moment's failure of nerve. The price paid for it was a heavy one. Still, I found the matter difficult to understand, because, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> {{there was nothing in}} Blake's character that made such a failure possible. Then it's known that personal courage was always a characteristic of your family." ...|$|E
6000|$|One day {{shortly after}} I had arrived I had an {{interesting}} visit, for de Souza, wishing to have an argument brought Mr. Grobelaar to see me. This gentleman was the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and {{had just returned from}} Mafeking, whither he had been conducting a 6-inch gun. He was a very well-educated person, and so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> honest and capable besides. With him came Reuter's Agent, Mr. Mackay, and the odious Malan. I received them sitting on my bed in the dormitory, and when they had lighted cigars, of which I always kept a stock, we had a regular durbar. I began: ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{in front}} of the gateway of the cattle-kraal, shading it, grew a single big tree of the wild fig order. Passing under this tree I looked and saw that the gateway was quite {{securely}} closed, as now I remembered I had noted at sunset. Then I started to go back but had not stepped {{more than two or three}} paces when, in the bright moonlight, I saw the head of my smallest ox, a beast of the Zulu breed, suddenly appear over the top of the wall. About this there would have been nothing particularly astonishing, had it not been for the fact that this head belonged to a dead animal, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> from the closed eyes and the hanging tongue.|$|E
6000|$|Her grief almost wrecked my own {{self-control}} but <b>I</b> soothed her <b>as</b> best <b>I</b> <b>could</b> by <b>telling</b> {{her that}} she would soon be among old friends and that she couldn't turn back now. [...] "Go on and make a little visit anyway," [...] I added. [...] "It's {{only a few hours}} from Ordway and you can go home at any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are coming}} out in quite a new light, Bob, as a squire of dames. But I won't laugh at you, now; I {{want to hear the}} last news. I {{overhauled}} that craft, not so much to capture her, as to get the last news. There were reports, before I started, that the Moors were joining the Spaniards, and that their ports were closed to us; and what you say confirms that. That was one of the points I wanted to know, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run in there safely, were <b>I</b> chased. Now, <b>as</b> to getting into the Rock, are their cruisers active, at present?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A leaf of it, at least, as far <b>as</b> you or <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> for Professor Westwood's copy {{is just as}} good, in all {{the parts}} finished, as the original: and, for all {{practical}} purpose, I show you here in my hand a leaf of the Bible which your own King Alfred saw with his own bright eyes, and from which he learned his child-faith {{in the days of}} dawning thought! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or say twenty quid, now. That's a fair offer. Would I? Eh! Would I? Not on your life. What d'ye say {{to fifty}} quid? That {{might begin to}} {{interest}} me, but a hundred quid would interest me more. Why, a hundred quid all in beer 'd come pretty close to floatin' this old hooker. But who in Sam Hill'd offer a hundred quid? I'd like to clap eyes on him once, that's all, just once. D'ye {{want to know what}} for? All right. I'll whisper it. So <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him to go to hell. Sure, Killeny Boy, just like that--oh, most polite, of course, just a kindly directin' of his steps where he'd never suffer from frigid extremities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One of them {{called to}} his {{companion}} {{that it was}} strange, if the Gentiles and the Child of Kings had perished in the fire, {{that they had not}} found their bones which would be known by the guns they carried. His friend answered that it was strange indeed, but being magicians, perhaps they had hidden away somewhere. For his part he hoped so, as then sooner or later they would be found and put to death slowly, as they deserved, who had led astray the Child of Kings and brought so many of the heaven-descended Abati to their death. Then fearing lest they should find and kill me, for they drew near <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by their voices, I crept back again, and that is all my story." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} {{that when we}} headed into the hollow {{it was at a}} point just above where the deer carcass hung in the scrub oak. Don in spite of Jones' stern yells, let out his eager hunting yelp and darted down the slope. The pack bolted after him and in less than ten seconds were racing up the hollow, their thrilling, blending bays a welcome spur to action. Though I spoke not a word to my mustang nor had time to raise the bridle, he wheeled to one side and began to run. The other horses also kept to the ridge, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by the pounding of hoofs on the soft turf. The hounds in full cry right under us urged our good steeds to a terrific pace. It was well that the ridge afforded clear going.|$|E
60|$|I {{think you}} can {{understand}} me when I say that I have a great fund of love, and no one to spend it upon, because there are not any to whom <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give it fully, and I love my pets so dearly, but I dare not and cannot enjoy it fully because--they die, or get injured, and then my misery is intense. <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you much, because your sympathy is so refined and so tender and true. Cannot I {{be a sort of}} second mother to you? I am sure the first one was often praying for blessings for you, and in this, at least, I resemble her.|$|R
60|$|He {{told me that}} he had {{cleansed}} and sewn up Stephen's wound, {{which appeared}} to be doing well, although the spear had pierced right through the shoulder, luckily without cutting any artery. So I went in to see the patient and found him cheerful enough, though weak from weariness and loss of blood, with Miss Hope feeding him with broth from a wooden native spoon. I didn't stop very long, especially after he got on to the subject of the lost orchid, about which he began to show signs of excitement. This <b>I</b> allayed <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> by <b>telling</b> him that I had preserved a pod of the seed, news at which he was delighted.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} deep red puckers in it, one {{just below the}} collar bone, and the other about half-way down on the right side. The skin of his body was {{extremely}} white up to the brown line of his neck, and the angry crinkled spots looked the more vivid against it. From above <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see {{that there was a}} corresponding pucker in the back at one place, but not at the other. Inexperienced <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> what that meant. Two bullets had pierced his chest; one had passed through it, and the other had remained inside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mind ye, Jess, I hae {{no desire}} to be friends wi' Marget. Naething could be farrer frae my wish than to hae helpit in the layin' oot o' Pete Lownie, an', I assure ye, Davit wasna keen to gang to the bural. 'If they dinna want me to their burals,' Davit says, 'they hae nae mair to do than to say sae. But I warn ye, Tibbie,' he says, 'if there's a bural frae this hoose, be it your bural, or be it my bural, not one o' the family o' Lownies casts their shadows upon the corp.' Thae was the very words Davit said to me as we watched the hearse frae the sky-licht. Ay, he bore up wonderfu', but he felt it, Jess--he felt it, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by his takkin' to drink again that very nicht. Jess, Jess. [...] .|$|E
60|$|For most of {{that time}} we were sitting now on turf, now on a chalk boulder, now on a timber groin, and talking one to the other, with the frankness proper to the {{intercourse}} of men of good intent, without reservations or aggressions, in the common, open fashion of contemporary intercourse to-day, but which then, nevertheless, was the rarest and strangest thing in the world. He for the most part talked, but at some shape of a question I told him--as plainly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> of passions that had for a time become incomprehensible to me--of my murderous pursuit of Nettie and her lover, and how the green vapors overcame me. He watched me with grave eyes and nodded understandingly, and afterwards he asked me brief penetrating questions about my education, my upbringing, my work. There was a deliberation in his manner, brief full pauses, that had in them no element of delay.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes or}} so more brought us to the eastern head of the lake, where the reeds whispered in the breath of the night wind like things alive. As I expected, {{it proved to be}} a bare, open space where nothing seemed to grow. Yes, and all about me were the {{decaying}} remains of elephants, hundreds of them, some with their bones covered in moss, that may have lain here for generations, and others more newly dead. They were all old beasts <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by the tusks, whether male or female. Indeed about me within a radius of {{a quarter of a mile}} lay enough ivory to make a man very rich for life, since although discoloured, much of it seemed to have kept quite sound, like human teeth in a mummy case. The sight gave me a new zest for life. If only I could manage to survive and carry off that ivory! I would. In this way or in that I swore that I would! Who could possibly die with so much ivory to be had for the taking? Not that old hunter, Allan Quatermain.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but {{you don't}} see all. I had no brother--no friend. You {{might have been}} both. You might have made me what you liked. You might have educated me far better than these teachers, or, at least given me some pride in my studies. There were so many things I wanted {{to know that they}} couldn't teach me; so many times I wanted advice from some one that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust. Colonel Pendleton was very good to me when he came; he always treated me like a princess even when I wore short frocks. It was his manner that first made me think he knew my family; but <b>I</b> never felt <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him anything, and I don't think, with all his chivalrous respect, he ever {{understood}} me. As to the others--the Mayors--well, you may judge from Mr. Henderson. It is a wonder that I did not run away or do something desperate. Now, are you not a LITTLE sorry?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I was {{not even}} able to touch the floor, the {{concrete}} floor of the warehouse.... After the shooting, I felt a strange kind of heat, warmth, which {{was coming from the}} blood that covered the concrete floor and I was stepping on the dead people who were lying around. But there were even men (just men) who were still alive, who were only wounded and <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> would step on him, I would hear him cry, moan, because I was trying to move <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that people had been completely disembodied and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel bones of the people that had been hit by those bursts of bullets or shells, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel their ribs crushing. Then I would get up again and continue....|$|R
60|$|I {{occupied}} the interval {{day at the}} farm in writing a plain narrative of the conspiracy, and in adding to it a statement of the practical contradiction which facts offered to the assertion of Laura's death. This I submitted to Mr. Kyrle before I read {{it the next day}} to the assembled tenants. We also arranged the form in which the evidence should be presented {{at the close of the}} reading. After these matters were settled, Mr. Kyrle endeavoured to turn the conversation next to Laura's affairs. Knowing, and desiring to know nothing of those affairs, and doubting whether he would approve, as a man of business, of my conduct in relation to my wife's life-interest in the legacy left to Madame Fosco, I begged Mr. Kyrle to excuse me if I abstained from discussing the subject. It was connected, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> truly <b>tell</b> him, with those sorrows and troubles of the past which we never referred to among ourselves, and which we instinctively shrank from discussing with others.|$|R
