60|$|The Eminent Authority took <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> at his tea, {{and looked}} round at us through his spectacles.|$|E
60|$|Liza took <b>another</b> <b>sip,</b> a {{slightly}} longer one; it burnt {{as it went}} down her throat, and sent through her a feeling of comfortable warmth.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause, {{during which}} both men eyed the noble {{specimens}} of fish which are preserved for tavern parlours. Captain Barber took <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of whisky.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused for}} breath, {{and she gave}} him <b>another</b> small <b>sip</b> of the brandy.|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{pause in}} the {{conversation}} appeared to startle Mr. Bashwood. He comforted himself with <b>another</b> little <b>sip</b> of wine, and, leaving the letter untouched, burst irrepressibly into words, as if the silence was quite unendurable to him.|$|R
60|$|And, {{leaving his}} unemptied glass upon the table, he {{departed}} {{and was never}} known to <b>sip</b> <b>another</b> drop of wine.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sharp, {{still on}} his legs, took <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of port and, {{avoiding}} the eye of Mr. Culpepper, which was showing signs of incipient inflammation, looked for encouragement to Miss Garland.|$|E
6000|$|Peter ventured on <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b> [...] "You don't {{think they}} would be {{satisfied}} if I recommended it as a medicine?" [...] insinuated Peter--"something to have about the house in case of accidental poisoning?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Colonel {{slightly}} {{lifted his}} shoulders, fortified himself with <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of the julep, and, leaning back, oratorically began to read,--the stranger leaning {{over him and}} following line by line with shining eyes.|$|E
50|$|Albanese was {{nominated}} as the Liberal {{candidate for the}} February 8, 2007 provincial by-election in the riding of York South—Weston. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of Joe Cordiano, who resigned his seat for personal reasons. The appointment of Albanese as the Liberal candidate was contested by David-Paul <b>Sip,</b> <b>another</b> potential candidate. <b>Sip</b> said that his candidacy was ignored by the riding association who wanted someone who would appeal to the riding's large Italian-speaking community. Sip launched {{a lawsuit against the}} Liberal party but Albanese remained as the Liberal candidate.|$|R
50|$|In <b>another</b> approach, <b>SIP</b> over P2P, the SIP {{location}} {{service is}} replaced by conventional P2P overlay networking approach, such as the OverSim framework.In this model, the overlay network is used for service or node discovery and rendezvous. The search key in such a mechanism is the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of a user agent. This URI requires resolution to a particular device or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that must be performed in real time.P2P-SIP systems may employ structured peer-to-peer approaches, as well as unstructured peer-to-peer architectures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new method for bounding the solution to constraint optimization problems called semi-independent partitioning. We show that our method is a strict generalization of the mini buckets algorithm [1]. We demonstrate empirically that <b>another</b> specialization of <b>SIP,</b> called greedy SIP, generally produces a better answer than mini buckets in much less time. ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Lord Badgery plucked sharply {{at one of}} his long coat tails. Mr. Tillotson paused, took <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of wine, and then went on with a newly won {{coherence}} and energy.|$|E
60|$|Quintal's amiability, {{even when}} roused to excess by drink, was easily dissipated. The free remarks of his comrade did not tend to {{increase}} it, {{but he said}} nothing, and refreshed himself with <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b>|$|E
60|$|That {{seemed to}} please the {{creature}} and it began walking around the cavern, making its way easily up the slope. While it was gone, Trot and Cap'n Bill each took <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> from the water-flask, to wash down their breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|There was a pause. Lord Marney dashed off <b>another</b> bumper; Egremont <b>sipped</b> his wine. At length he said, [...] "This {{argument}} made me {{forget the}} principal reason, George, why I am glad {{that we are}} alone together to-day. I am sorry to bore you, but I am bored myself deucedly. I find a letter from my agent. These election accounts must be settled." ...|$|R
50|$|For instance, for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User agent (B2BUA), an ALG {{can allow}} {{firewall}} traversal with SIP. If the firewall has its SIP traffic terminated on an ALG then {{the responsibility for}} permitting SIP sessions passes to the ALG instead of the firewall. An ALG can solve <b>another</b> major <b>SIP</b> headache: NAT traversal. Basically a NAT with a built-in ALG can rewrite information within the SIP messages and can hold address bindings until the session terminates. A SIP ALG will also handle SDP {{in the body of}} SIP messages (which is used ubiquitously in VoIP to set up media endpoints), since SDP also contains literal IP addresses and ports that must be translated.|$|R
50|$|Commonly, {{the couple}} ceremonially cut {{the first piece}} of the cake, and in a nod to an ancient Roman wedding rite, may feed a bite to one <b>another</b> and perhaps <b>sip</b> a glass of wine or other drink with linked arms. Then the cake is served to the guests. Like being asked to pour tea at a formal tea party, being asked to serve the cake is {{generally}} considered an honor.|$|R
6000|$|Foster's {{first impulse}} was to spit out the sip he had taken, for to his {{surprise}} the coffee was thick with grounds. He swallowed it, however, and wondered. Then, on taking <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> and considering it, he perceived that the grounds were not as grounds {{to which he had}} been accustomed, but were reduced--no doubt by severe pounding--to a pasty condition, which made the beverage resemble chocolate. [...] "Coffee-soup! with sugar--but no milk!" [...] he muttered, as he tried <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b> This third one convinced him that the ideas of Arabs regarding coffee did not coincide with those of Englishmen, so he finished the cup at the fourth sip, much as he would have taken a dose of physic, and thereafter amused himself with contemplating the other coffee-sippers.|$|E
60|$|The bluff doctor {{put on his}} spectacles, {{and looked}} over the slip of yellow and worn paper scrutinizingly, puffing tobacco-smoke upon it in great volumes, as if thereby to make its hidden purport come out; he mumbled to himself, he took <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> from his flask; and then, putting {{it down on the}} table, {{appeared}} to meditate.|$|E
60|$|On examination, Ned found, to {{his great}} relief; that his friend's hurts were slight. He had been {{stunned by the}} {{severity}} of his fall, but no bones were broken, {{and only a few}} scratches received, so that, after <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of brandy, he felt almost as well as ever. But he firmly resisted his companion's entreaty to leave the cavern.|$|E
60|$|The Rector ate a biscuit, {{mechanically}} <b>sipped</b> <b>another</b> {{glass of}} wine, {{and was even}} able to eat a kidney when they were brought up. Although September was not yet out, the Squire had a fire lighted in the room, and after the meal was over, and two steaming tumblers of punch were placed upon the table, {{he took a long}} pipe from the mantel, filled and lighted it, then filled another, and handed it to the Rector, at the same time holding out a light to him.|$|R
5000|$|The label 'social media' {{has been}} {{attached}} to a quickly growing number of Web sites whose content is primarily user-driven. These communities are large-scale examples of SIP. Navigating the 'social' world of information online is largely a product of interpersonal connections online, and has prompted the creation of aggregating, or collaborative sources, to help assist collective groups of people sort through information. Learning about others through the concept of [...] "seamless sharing" [...] opens <b>another</b> word for <b>SIP.</b> Some computer tools that facilitate this process are: ...|$|R

These problems are NP-hard in general, but have many practical applications. State of the art methods for solving them[3, 6, 8, 7] rely upon branch and bound search with a heuristic to compute a lower bound {{on the quality of}} the best solution that can be found by extendingthe partial assignment associated with the current node...|$|R
6000|$|Jack waited. The fiery grip of {{the brandy}} relaxed; the genial warmth of it was wafted through him persuasively from head to foot. He took <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b> His eyes began to glitter. [...] "What divine being made this?" [...] he asked. Without waiting to be answered, he tried it again, and emptied the cup. [...] "More!" [...] he cried. [...] "I never felt so big, I never felt so strong, I never felt so clever, as I feel now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have no {{hesitation}} in saying,' said Mr. Chillip, fortifying himself with <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of negus, 'between you and me, sir, {{that her mother}} died of it--or that tyranny, gloom, and worry have made Mrs. Murdstone nearly imbecile. She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her, now, more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law. That was Mrs. Chillip's remark to me, only last week. And I assure you, sir, the ladies are great observers. Mrs. Chillip herself is a great observer!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{spoke the}} heart of a Blanco!" [...] he exclaimed, {{clutching}} my arm, and then, the boat giving a lurch at that moment, almost dragging me down in his efforts to steady himself. After <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of rum he went on: [...] "But who are you, young sir, if that is not an impertinent question? Do you possess money, influence, powerful friends, that you take upon yourself the care of this woman? Is it in your power to baffle and crush her enemy or enemies, to protect not only her person, but her property, which, in her absence, will become the prey of robbers?" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> area of <b>SIP</b> {{that has}} {{received}} some criticism relates to its testability. Walther has been a self-reflective critic of his own theory. First, Walther acknowledges that SIP has not fully acknowledged nor clarified {{the role of the}} issue of time in CMC relationships. Second, in discussing the hyperpersonal perspective, Walther admits that not all of the theoretical components of his hyperpersonal approach have been researched sufficiently. Third, in examining the warranting hypothesis, Walther, Brandon Van Der Heide, Lauren Hamel, & Hillary Shulman accept the fact that high warranting value may exist on those matters that have strong social desirability. For example, physical attractiveness is a highly desirable trait in the United States, making it socially desirable. So, as Walther accepts, online communicators would seek corroboration for those qualities that society deems important or desirable. Whether or not other less socially desirable qualities are prone to warranting overtures is not fully explained.|$|R
5000|$|... a {{grouping}} of some dissident {{members of the}} TBKP who held a [...] "rebirth meeting" [...] in 1993, started to publish the periodical Ürün Sosyalist Dergi (Harvest Socialist Magazine). Actually, in the aim of giving out the voice of TKP through a legal path, the first publication of Ürün Sosyalist Dergi was made in 1974, but the martial law authority banned its publication in 1980. After the [...] "rebirth meeting" [...] in 1993, the contributors of the meeting restarted the periodicals publication in 1997. Almost after a decade, the group which summoned up around this publication, expanded enough to reestablish the TKP again. In 2012, they officially announced the reestablishment of the TKP. But this initiative resulted as a dichotomy, because {{of the existence of}} <b>another</b> party (Former <b>SIP)</b> which started to use the same name in 2001. So the contributors of the rebirth initiative decided to change the official name of the TKP as TKP 1920.|$|R
40|$|Tacitus 1 {{writes that}} after the {{destruction}} of Rome, Nero hosted the largest party {{in the history of}} the Roman Empire. The writers, playwrights, men of letters, senators, artists, the crème de la crème of Roman society were there. As darkness fell on this extravaganza, Nero ordered that the Christian captives be brought in and set alight to provide illumination for the proceedings. We know Nero was crazy, but what about his guests? You wonder, what kind of mindset would allow you to reach for <b>another</b> canapé and <b>sip</b> from your goblet of wine as another prisoner bursts into flame? There is a common myth that bad things can only done by people who are born bad and take sadistic pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on others. It was thought that the innate evil qualities of Nazi war criminals would be indicated across the various psychological tests given them around the Nuremberg trials. To everyone’s surprise, no particular orientation emerged. Indeed the tests showed that they were reasonably well-balanced and very intelligent, not the psycho-pathological monsters everyone was expecting. (Browning, Baumeister...|$|R
60|$|This {{unexpected}} deviation into sense {{increased the}} general feeling of discomfort. It became {{necessary to take}} the old man seriously, to regard him as a human being. Up till then he had been {{no more than an}} object of curiosity, a mummy in an absurd suit of evening-clothes with a green ribbon across the shirt front. People could not help wishing that they had subscribed a little more. Fifty-eight pounds ten it wasn't enormous. But happily for the peace of mind of the company, Mr. Tillotson paused again, took <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of wine, and began {{to live up to his}} proper character by talking absurdly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, {{thanks for}} {{reminding}} me. Let me have <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of that mixture. Then I shall speak of other more hopeful things. And {{the sweetness of}} hope shall be like that rosy honey, rose-scented, to soften my throat, made dry and harsh with barren themes. After all, Connie, these troubles which have tried us so severely have only proved blessings in disguise. Yes, Fan, we have been driven hither and thither about the sea, encountering terrible storms, and sometimes fearing that our bark was about to founder; but they have at last driven us into a haven more sweet and restful than storm-tossed mariners ever entered before. And looking back we can even feel grateful to the furious wind, and the hateful dark blue wave that brought us to such a goal." ...|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{he began}} slowly and painfully, but with unyielding perseverance, to push, and draw, and hitch himself, while lying at full length, towards the spring, which he reached at last so exhausted, {{that he had}} barely put his lips to it and {{swallowed}} a mouthful, when his head dropped, and he almost fainted. He was within an ace of being drowned, but with a violent effort he drew his face out of the spring, and lay there in a half unconscious condition for some time, with the clear cool water playing about his temples. Reviving in a little time, he took <b>another</b> <b>sip,</b> and then crawled back to his couch. Immediately he fell into a profound slumber, from which Cuffy strove in vain to awaken him; therefore, like a sagacious dog, he lay down at his master's side and joined him in repose.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Sey," [...] my {{respected}} connection went on, after <b>another</b> long pause, <b>sipping</b> {{his coffee}} pensively, [...] "I feel I must be aided in this superhuman task {{by a professional}} unraveller of cunning disguises. I shall go to Marvillier's to-morrow--fortunate man, Marvillier--and ask him to supply me with a really good 'tec, who will stop {{in the house and}} keep an eye upon every living soul that comes near me. He shall scan each nose, each eye, each wig, each whisker. He shall be my watchful half, my unsleeping self; it shall be his business to suspect all living men, all breathing women. The Archbishop of Canterbury shall not escape for a moment his watchful regard; he will take care that royal princesses don't collar the spoons or walk off with the jewel-cases. He must see possible Colonel Clays in the guard of every train and the parson of every parish; he must detect the off-chance of a Mme. Picardet in every young girl that takes tea with Amelia, every fat old lady that comes to call upon Isabel. Yes, I have made my mind up. I shall go to-morrow and secure such a man at once at Marvillier's." ...|$|R
