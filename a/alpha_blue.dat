50|$|To {{render a}} 2D {{projection}} of the 3D data set, one first needs to define a camera in space relative to the volume.

40|$|A {{solid-state}} {{digital camera}} {{was developed for}} obtaining H alpha images of solar flares with 0. 1 s time resolution. Beginning {{in the summer of}} 1988, this system will be operated in conjunction with SMM's hard X-ray burst spectrometer (HXRBS). Important electron time-of-flight effects that are crucial for determining the flare energy release processes should be detectable with these combined H alpha and hard X-ray observations. Charge-injection device (CID) cameras provide 128 x 128 pixel images simultaneously in the H <b>alpha</b> <b>blue</b> wing, line center, and red wing, or other wavelength of interest. The data recording system employs a microprocessor-controlled, electronic interface between each camera and a digital processor board that encodes the data into a serial bitstream for continuous recording by a standard video cassette recorder. Only {{a small fraction of the}} data will be permanently archived through utilization of a direct memory access interface onto a VAX- 750 computer. In addition to correlations with hard X-ray data, observations from the high speed H alpha camera will also be correlated and optical and microwave data and data from future MAX 1991 campaigns. Whether the recorded optical flashes are simultaneous with X-ray peaks to within 0. 1 s, are delayed by tenths of seconds or are even undetectable, the results will have implications on the validity of both thermal and nonthermal models of hard X-ray production...|$|E

The cartel is a production agreement between the following companies: Anglo <b>Alpha</b> Limited, <b>Blue</b> Circle Limited and Pretoria Portland Cement Company Limited. The Government has advised, due to the discouragement of competition resulting from the determination of market prices by the cartel, that the cartel be disbanded as from 31 December 1995. Companies within the cement industry applying for credit facilities, need to be evaluated and their credit risk analysed before they can be granted with credit. The financial information that the company provides is not adequate enough to assess the creditworthiness of the company. Other factors affecting the cement industry should also be identified to help with the evaluation. This need together with the disbandment of the cartel emphasises the fact that risk areas should now be identified that can later be used to evaluate the company's creditworthiness. Therefore a model for credit evaluation is developed...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} be {{published}} {{as part of the}} Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Astrophysical Journal Letters Special Issue. Links to the full set of papers will be available at [URL] after November 22, 2004 We present measurements of the UV galaxy luminosity function and the evolution of luminosity density from GALEX observations matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We analyze galaxies in the Medium Imaging Survey overlapping the SDSS DR 1 with a total coverage of 44 deg^ 2. Using the combined GALEX+SDSS photometry, we compute photometric redshifts and study the LF in three redshift shells between z= 0. 07 and 0. 25. The Schechter function fits indicate that the faint-end slope alpha is consistent with - 1. 1 at all redshifts but the characteristic UV luminosity M* brightens by 0. 2 mag from z= 0. 07 to 0. 25. In the lowest redshift bin, early and late type galaxies are studied separately and we confirm that red galaxies tend to be brighter and have a shallower slope <b>alpha</b> than <b>blue</b> ones. The derived luminosity densities are consistent with other GALEX results based on a local spectroscopic sample from 2 dF and the evolution follows the trend reported by deeper studies...|$|R

40|$|A sensitivemethod for the {{detection}} of ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase) in human serums, using Fe(Il) as the substrate, is described. Initial Fe(ll) concentrations of 30 and 120 p.

S INCE 1948, when Holmberg and Laurell (1) first isolated the <b>blue</b> <b>alpha</b> 2 globulin from plasma, which they called ceruloplasmin, various methods have been employed for the determination of its enzymatic ac-tivity and/or concentration in human serum.
