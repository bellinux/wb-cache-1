25|$|Kurzweil says {{evolutionary}} progress looks smooth, {{but that}} really it {{is divided into}} paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm.</b> So {{what looks like a}} single smooth curve is really series of smaller S curves. For example Kurzweil notes that when vacuum tubes stopped getting faster, cheaper transistors became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> for multi-objective {{optimization}} {{based on}} novelty was presented using evolutionary algorithms. This new paradigm searches for novel solutions in objective space (i.e., novelty search on objective space) {{in addition to}} the search for non-dominated solutions. Novelty search is like stepping stones guiding the search to previously unexplored places. It is specially useful in overcoming bias and plateaus as well as guiding the search in many-objective optimization problems. Subpopulation Algorithm based on Novelty is the first algorithm based on this paradigm.|$|E

25|$|In the Six-Day War, Sharon, {{in command}} of an armored {{division}} on the Sinai front, drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's 38th Division faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the Battle of Abu-Ageila led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> in operational command. Researchers at the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering {{each other as they}} were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.|$|E
25|$|The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll {{responded that}} Grinder has not {{understood}} Kuhn's {{text on the}} history and philosophy of science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create paradigm shifts volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn's text does not contain the idea that being unqualified {{in a field of}} science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates a paradigm shift in that field and (c) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is foremost a work of history and not an instructive text on creating paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible—extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that a paradigm shift is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current (dominant) paradigm that produces data that can't be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence a paradigm shift, i.e. the adoption of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm.</b>|$|E
25|$|In any {{community}} of scientists, Kuhn states, {{there are some}} individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a crisis exists, embark on what Kuhn calls revolutionary science, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear {{to be accompanied by}} numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a paradigm shift will have occurred.|$|E

500|$|For Kuhn, {{the choice}} of {{paradigm}} was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more [...] "portraits" [...] against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process {{as much as a}} logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism. According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> makes sense of them. That is, {{the choice of}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.|$|E

500|$|The book {{opens with}} the {{statement}} that [...] "war no longer exists"; that is, war as [...] "battle in a field between men and machinery" [...] or [...] "a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs" [...] is unlikely to happen again. The premise of the book is that the world is experiencing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> of war in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, which Smith dubs [...] "war amongst the people", in which nebulous, open-ended conflicts have become the norm. Smith believes that Western, industrialised armies struggle to win in [...] "wars amongst the people" [...] because their opponents are not uniformed armies. He uses the term [...] "rhizomatic" [...] to describe terrorist and guerrilla movements; he states his belief that such fighters can adapt much more easily than state institutions, and that they exhibit a greater understanding of the utility of force. Rather than being part of a recognisable army, the fighters are part of the civilian population, and their objectives are more political than military—they seek to [...] "win hearts and minds" [...] rather than take or hold territory. As a consequence, wars are no longer confined to a battlefield, but the theatre of operations is fluid, and commanders now operate inside the theatre.|$|E
500|$|The Edgeworths jointly {{developed}} {{the concept of}} [...] "Practical Education", a principle that would become <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> by the 1820s. Having determined that after eight years, Richard Edgeworth's attempt to raise his eldest son Richard according {{to the principles of}} Rousseau was a failure, he and Honora were determined to find better methods. After the birth of Honora's first child (1774), the Edgeworths embarked on a plan, partly inspired by Anna Barbauld, to write a series of books for children. After trying many other methods, Barbauld's Lessons for Children from two to three years old was published in 1778, and the Edgeworths used it on Anna (5) and Honora (4), and were delighted to find that the girls learned to read in six weeks. Now back in England, at Northchurch the Edgeworths were in closer contact with the intellectuals of the Lunar society. Richard Edgeworth and Honora were determined to design a plan for the education of their children. They started by reviewing the existing literature on childhood education (including Locke, Hartley, Priestley in addition to Rousseau), and then proceeded to document their observations of the behaviour of children and then {{developed the}}ir own [...] "practical" [...] system. To this end Erasmus Darwin suggested they start by reading the work of Dugald Stewart. Honora Sneyd then started recording extensive notes on her observations of the Edgeworth children. These then became the dialogues in the final book.|$|E

500|$|Smith's thesis, and {{the central}} theme of The Utility of Force, {{is that the world}} entered <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> of {{conflict}} {{at the end of the}} 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, which he calls [...] "war amongst the people", and that Western, industrialised armies are ill-suited to the new style of warfare. The defining characteristics of [...] "war amongst the people" [...] are that conflicts tend to be timeless, more political in nature, and fought between parties that are part of, and in amongst, the civilian population rather than between uniformed armies on a battlefield. To prove his theory, Smith provides a detailed history starting with Napoleon, who invented what Smith calls [...] "industrial warfare"—the paradigm in which the entire resources of the nation were mustered and which culminated in the two world wars. In the second half of the book, Smith states that the advent of nuclear weapons rendered industrial warfare obsolete, but that Western governments and generals refused to acknowledge the new paradigm, which led to several significant defeats in the second half of the 20th century. He provides six themes which characterise modern conflicts and proceeds to analyse each in detail, before dedicating his final chapter to his reflections on his command in Bosnia. He concedes that he did not foresee the Srebenica massacre, but criticises UNPROFOR, believing that it was not in a position to act even had the massacre been foreseen and that it had no strategy for effectively intervening in the war. In his conclusion, Smith argues that military force is only part of the solution in modern conflicts, and that it must be combined with political initiatives which together will subdue but not necessarily end the conflict.|$|E
