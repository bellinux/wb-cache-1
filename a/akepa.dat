5|$|Bird species {{native to}} the acacia koa–ōhia forest include the Hawaiian crow (Corvus hawaiiensis), the <b>akepa</b> (Loxops coccineus), Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana), ʻakiapōlāʻau (Hemignathus munroi), and Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), {{all of which are}} endangered, threatened, or near threatened; the Hawaiian crow in {{particular}} is extinct in the wild, but there are plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds have}} a {{breeding}} season in spring. The Hawaii <b>akepa</b> {{is the only}} obligate cavity-nester in Hawaii. There are no cavity-making birds in Hawaii (another honeycreeper, the ʻakiapolaʻau, drills small holes and excavates bark, but does not make holes large enough for <b>akepa</b> nests). Thus, the <b>akepa</b> must find naturally occurring cavities in the trunks and branches. Such cavities are generally found only in very large, old trees, making the <b>akepa</b> an old-growth obligate. Large courtship groups have been observed during the breeding season, which is curious because this species makes permanent bonds. Another anomaly {{is the fact that}} for such a small bird, it does not lay many eggs—usually one or two, instead of the three to five of other similarly sized species.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} need for tree cavities, <b>akepa</b> rely on old-growth ōhia and koa forests for nesting. Although the largest populations of <b>akepa</b> live within {{protected}} lands, large trees appear to be falling faster than they are replaced. It is unclear how management can deal with this in the medium-term, except by use of artificial nest boxes. Past experiments with nest boxes (Freed et al., 1987) have shown that birds will occasionally use them, with high nesting success. There is no ongoing research or use of nest boxes for <b>akepa</b> as of 2010.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{selection}} plays {{a fundamental}} {{role in the}} ecological theory of adaptive radiation. A prediction of this theory is the convergent evolution of traits in lineages experiencing similar environments. The Hawaiian honeycreepers are a spectacular example of adaptive radiation and may demonstrate convergence, but uncertainty about phylogenetic relationships within the group has made it difficult to assess such evolutionary patterns. We examine the phylogenetic relationships of the Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana), a bird that in a suite of morphological, ecological and behavioural traits closely resembles the Kauai creeper (Oreomystis bairdi), but whose mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and osteology suggest a relationship with the amakihis (Hemignathus in part) and <b>akepas</b> (Loxops). We analysed nuclear DNA sequence data from 11 relevant honeycreeper taxa and one outgroup to test whether the character contradiction results from historical hybridization and mtDNA introgression, or convergent evolution. We found no evidence of past hybridization, a phenomenon that remains undocumented in Hawaiian honeycreepers, and confirmed mtDNA and osteological evidence that the Hawaii creeper is most closely related to the amakihis and <b>akepas.</b> Thus, the morphological, ecological and behavioural similarities between the evolutionarily distant Hawaii and Kauai creepers represent an extreme example of convergent evolution and demonstrate how natural selection can lead to repeatable evolutionary outcomes...|$|R
50|$|Surviving <b>akepa</b> {{live only in}} {{old growth}} forest above 1,200 m elevation. This {{is a sign that}} avian malaria and avian pox {{have played a role in}} killing off populations of <b>akepa</b> at lower elevations. These {{introduced}} diseases are implicated in more than 20 bird extinctions in Hawaii since 1826, when the first mosquito (Anopheles species) was introduced to the islands. Disease continues to be a threat, and could result in extinction of the <b>akepa</b> if Hawaiian climate continues to warm (or if new bird diseases or mosquito species are allowed to invade the islands).|$|E

5000|$|Loxops ochraceus: The Maui <b>akepa</b> {{was found}} on the {{mountain}} of Haleakalā in east Maui. This population was detected at low numbers until 1992, when the last sighting was documented. There are still reports of green yellow birds flying in the remote reserve, so there may be individuals remaining, but this is very unlikely as dedicated intensive surveys have failed to confirm any Maui <b>akepa.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Hawaiʻi <b>akepa</b> survives only in two {{or three}} locations, all on the island of Hawaii: one {{population}} in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (on the Hamakua Coast of Mauna Kea), one in the upper forest areas of Kau (in {{the southern part of the}} island), and one on the northern slope of Hualālai (perhaps extirpated). As of 2000, about 14,000 Hawaii <b>akepa</b> remained. They were listed as an endangered species in 1975.|$|E
50|$|All <b>akepa</b> have {{an unusual}} cross-bill. When closed, the upper bill tip {{slightly}} overlaps the lower bill tip {{to one side}} (this cannot {{be seen in the}} field). When opening the bill, as in prying open leaf buds to extract small caterpillars, the bills swing dramatically sideways, and this is easily seen in the hand. Some birds cross one way, and some the other, apparently randomly. The <b>akepa</b> cross-bill operates similarly to that in the North American crossbills (genus Loxia), but is much less obvious when the bill is closed.|$|E
50|$|The {{group is}} highly {{dependent}} on ʻōhiʻa lehua trees and koa trees for food. The bills are specialized for opening ʻōhiʻa lehua leaf buds in search of small caterpillars. Fretz (2002) suggests that this food source is only found in old-growth Hawaiian forests and could be one factor in <b>akepa</b> population declines. The lehua (or blossom) of the ʻōhiʻa tree provides a source of nectar that this bird consumes occasionally. The koa tree's cracked bark serves as a home for many insects and arthropods that the <b>akepa</b> finds delectable.|$|E
50|$|The akekee is a greenish-yellow {{bird with}} a black mask around the eye (especially {{prominent}} in the male) and a bluish bill, unlike the <b>akepa,</b> which is usually red, canary-yellow or orange, without black, and has a horn-colored bill. The bill-tips are crossed over, though not bent as in the distantly-related crossbills (Loxia). The akekee uses its bill like scissors to cut open buds in search of insects to eat. It also feeds on the nectar of some trees. This bird builds nests primarily of twigs high up in trees, while the <b>akepa</b> uses tree cavities as nest sites.|$|E
50|$|Its call {{is a short}} “chip”, {{which is}} similar to the Maui Nui alauahio, chirped every three to five seconds. It song {{consists}} of “cheer” notes that are slower and richer than the <b>ākepa.</b> It also has a short song that sounds like “cheer-wee”.|$|E
5000|$|Loxops wolstenholmei: The Oahu <b>akepa</b> {{was found}} in large numbers until the 1890s. Immediately afterward, {{a sharp drop in}} its numbers was noted. Many feel that it had {{disappeared}} by the 1920s; however, scattered, unconfirmed reports were posted in the 1990s. This subspecies' male was brick red in coloration, while the female was dark gray.|$|E
5000|$|Loxops coccineus: The Hawaiʻi <b>akepa</b> survives only in two {{or three}} locations, all on the island of Hawaii: one {{population}} in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (on the Hamakua Coast of Mauna Kea), one in the upper forest areas of Kau (in {{the southern part of the}} island), and one on the northern slope of Hualālai (perhaps extirpated).|$|E

It is endemic to the island of Kauai where it is found in small numbers in higher elevations. Because of their similar size, shape, and unusual bill, the akekee and the <b>akepa</b> (Loxops coccineus) were for some time classified as a single species. This was eventually changed, because of differences in their color, nesting behavior, and calls.|$|E

Only ten months after his defeat in Chimbu, {{he was back in}} Parliament as the representative for the Unggai-Bena Open electorate. By August 1983 he had resumed the Leadership of National Party and again became Leader of the Opposition. In mid November a move for a No Confidence Motion was in the works again.

5000|$|The Hawaiʻi ʻakepa (Loxops coccineus) is an {{endangered}} ʻakepa native to Hawaiʻi in the Hawaiian Islands. All {{three of the}} ʻakepa were considered monotypic before being split by the NACC of the AOU in 2015. The Hawaii <b>akepa</b> was first collected by western science during Captain James Cook's third voyage around the world. Several specimens were collected, as well as feather leis (necklaces resembling strings of flowers) constructed by Hawaiian artisans. The specimens were classified when brought back to England several years later. The Latin name of the bird, Loxops coccineus, means [...] "crossed" [...] (Loxops) and [...] "red" [...] (coccineus). The word coccineus is also used in another Hawaiian bird, the ʻiʻiwi (Vestiaria coccineus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>akepa</b> (Loxops sp.) are a {{group of}} one of the {{smallest}} Hawaiian forest birds, at four inches long and weighing 10 grams. They are placed in the genus Loxops. Only one of the species in the genus, the Hawaiʻi ʻakepa, is still extant, and is classified as Endangered by the IUCN. Previously considered conspecific, the group was split into distinct species in 2015. Found only in high elevation old growth rainforest, these nonmigratory passerines have rounded heads, black eyes, and black wings and tail. Adult males sport one of the most brilliant orange colors found in any bird, a plumage which takes four years to develop. Females are greenish gray on back, lighter gray on front, with varying amounts of yellow and sometimes pale orange on the breast and belly. Juveniles appear similar to females, though are generally duller in color.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} passage is worth quoting directly; [...] "Fr.

No permanent buildings had been erected and Fr. Mathews on visiting the site found two priests ‘living there in the most primitive wattle and daub construction you can imagine’. It was decided to transfer them to Budaka and let two more experienced men, Father Kirk and Father Drontman takeover for a time. Sometime later Father Kiggen who was assistant at Budini was sent to Ngora to get the foundation going. He arrived there on 12 March 1912, and showed great enterprise encouraging the use of plough among the Teso, teaching them to use the yoke {{and was the first}} to undertake the burning of bricks" [...] (Tom Tuma, Phares Mutibwa, A Century of Christianity in Uganda 1877-1975: Nairobi, Uzima Ltd.,1978, p. 54).

50|$|Increases in the Japanese white-eye {{population}} in Hawaii have {{negative effects on}} the growth and survival of native birds in the community. In one study, the bill length, tarsus length, and mass of native Hawaiian passerine birds were measured during 1987-2006 using the technique of mark and recapture. In 2000, juveniles of every native species showed lower mass and shorter bills than before. These changes led to decreased survival of both juveniles and second year individuals/older adults. These birds also showed shorter tarsi, the group of bones in the hind feet of some vertebrates, although this change was less drastic than that seen with the bills. Birds with original bill lengths closest {{to that of the}} white-eye suffered the most, undergoing changes that lowered their foraging efficiency. For example, the endangered Hawaiian <b>akepa</b> was viable during 1987-1999, but not during 2000-2006, in association with an abrupt increase in white-eyes. These facts document strong community-wide exploitative competition for food between the Japanese white-eye and passerine birds native to Hawaii, meaning the white-eye depletes the availability of food for other bird species. They also compete for space; the white-eye has expanded its range into remote areas within the two decades 1980-2000. The distribution of the Japanese white-eye has been shown to negatively correlate with the distributions of native birds, meaning as the white-eye becomes more highly distributed, native birds become less distributed. Many Hawaiian birds are endangered or already extinct; this occurrence is believed {{to be related to the}} invasion of the white-eye.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 51 - 62). viii, 62 leaves, bound 29 cmAs {{a result}} of disease, habitat destruction, and other anthropogenic factors, the Hawaii <b>Akepa</b> (Loxops coccineus coccineus) currently occupies less than 10 % of its original range and exists in five widely separated populations, raising concerns about what effect such reduction and fragmentation has had on the connectivity and diversity of <b>Akepa</b> populations. In this study, both historical and contemporary samples were utilized to assess genetic diversity and structure in this endangered Hawaiian honeycreeper. Sequence data from ND 2, control region, and two nuclear introns were obtained from {{three of the five}} current populations, and control region sequence data were obtained from museum specimens collected over 100 years ago throughout the historical range of the bird. Results indicate that despite recent declines and fragmentation, genetic diversity has not yet been lost. No clear phylogeographic breaks were observed across the historical range of <b>Akepa,</b> but rather genetic differentiation was modest and seemed to follow a pattern of isolation-by-distance. Low levels of differentiation between the contemporary populations observed with mtDNA but not nuclear sequences indicate that not much divergence, if any. has occurred post-fragmentation. Rather, the present structure seen likely reflects historical isolation-by-distance. Ironically, this declining species exhibits the genetic signal of an expanding population, demonstrating that earlier demographic events are outweighing the effects of recent changes in population size, and genetic estimates of N., though crude, suggest Hawaii <b>Akepa</b> were at least an order of magnitude more abundant prior to the decline...|$|E
40|$|SummaryExploitative {{competition}} {{is a major}} determinant of community structure in natural assemblages [1, 2], but, introduced species are rarely competitors that lead to extinction of native species [3, 4]. Here we document strong community-wide competition from the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) on native Hawaiian passerine birds. Introduced in 1929 [5], white-eye successfully invaded old-growth forest and coexisted with eight native species [6], overlapping multiple foraging substrates with each but evidencing no agonistic interactions [7]. The endangered Hawaii <b>akepa</b> (Loxops coccineus coccineus) was viable during 1987 – 1999 but became nonviable during 2000 – 2006 in association with an abrupt increase in white-eyes [7]. We show that after 2000, juveniles of every native bird species measured had lower mass and shorter bills and tarsi. For most species, lower mass led to decreased juvenile survival, and shorter bills to decreased survival of second-year and older adults. Lower survival of smaller birds represents normalizing selection that is restoring previous size means to future generations [8]. Birds at a nearby site with fewer white-eyes had normal size. White-eye had less stunting of bills and did not suffer the survival consequences of native species. Exploitative competition for food between native birds and an introduced species requires intensive management to prevent further declines...|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. The Kilauea Forest Reserve is notable for the island of Hawaii because it provides habitat for at least nine species of endemic birds, of which six species are members of the Hawaiian Honeycreeper family (Drepanididae) : Amakihi, <b>Akepa,</b> Creeper, Akiapolaau, Apapane, and Iiwi. The other endemic species are the Hawaiian Hawk, the Elepaio, and the Hawaiian Thrush. The thrush is abundant throughout the forest, and is common even in areas that have been disturbed by cattle and by logging operations. Two species of introduced birds occur in relatively large numbers: Japanese White-eye and Red-billed Leiothrix. Other species of introduced birds are found in the pasture land adjacent to the forest but have not been seen within the forest itself. The foraging behavior of endemic and introduced species is discussed. No data are available to suggest that introduced species compete with endemic birds for food or for nesting sites. Nesting data are presented. An apparently unusual feature about the Apapane is that this species not uncommonly builds its nest on the tops of tree fern fronds, rather than in ohia trees, which is the typical site for nests of this species in ohia-tree fern forests. The adaptability of three endemic species (Elepaio, Amakihi, Akiapolaau) and two introduced species (Japanese White-eye, Red-billed Leiothrix) to wide vegetational and climatic conditions is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Biodiversity is {{threatened}} by habitat loss and degradation. In Hawaiʻi, species persistence will likely depend on varying degrees of habitat restoration. Efforts to restore habitats for Hawaiian forest birds include reforestation of degraded pasture with Acacia koa (koa), a valuable endemic hardwood. I investigated the ecological benefits of koa reforestation areas (KRAs) to forest bird conservation at two sites on Hawaiʻi Island. I compared vegetation characteristics of KRAs and native forests and found that koa forestry can facilitate native understory development in some cases. The "Field of Dreams" hypothesis, which states that animals will colonize restored vegetation structure, was assessed by analyzing bird behavior in KRAs and native forest sites. Two endangered species in this community (Hawaii <b>akepa</b> (Loxops coccineus) and Hawaiʻi Creeper (Oreomystis mana)) are missing or uncommon in the KRAs. Four species have colonized the KRAs: Hawaiʻi 'Amakihi (Hemignathus virens), 'Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis), 'Oma'o (Myadestes obscurus) and 'Akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi). 'I'iwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea) allocate time differently in the KRAs and native forests. Sequential behavior analysis suggested that KRAs and intact forests may not be equivalent habitat for juveniles of four species. Six species of forest birds use the KRAs for foraging. I found that foraging microhabitat differs between KRAs and native forest sites for Hawaiʻi 'Amakihi. Foraging niche breadth and overlap for all species were similar across sites. I calculated indices of foraging effort and opportunity and found that !Apapane appear to forage differently in the KRAs and native forest sites. My results suggest that animal behavior can be informative in assessment of restoration success. I conclude that KRAs have ecological benefits: they provide some ecosystem services and can enhance native forest understory development. KRAs provide foraging habitat for Hawaiian forest birds. While four bird species have colonized the KRAs, we will not know if {{they have done so}} successfully until demographic studies can be completed. Finally, the conservation benefit of the KRAs exists only {{as long as they are}} standing: if these forests are to be harvested in the future, extreme care will be required if it is to be sustainable...|$|E
