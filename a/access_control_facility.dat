5000|$|Throughout the decade, {{the company}} grew rapidly via several {{strategic}} and some surprising acquisitions: CGA Computer's Top Secret product, plus software makers Capex Corporation (flagship products OPTIMIZER, TLMS, SCHEDULER), Johnson Systems (flagship product JARS), Value Software (flagship product DISPATCH) and Uccel Corporation among them. In {{recognition of his}} success in 1983, Charles Wang was given a [...] "Software CEO of the Year" [...] award. In May 1985, CA-Unicenter was introduced as an integrated collection of many of its recently acquired, mainframe systems products. Its sales (often [...] "wrap & roll" [...] financial deals) helped bring CA enough revenue and market share, especially from existing customers converting from DOS/VSE (z/VSE today) to OS/MVS (z/OS today), that CA was eventually able to acquire its archrival, UCCEL Corporation, in 1987. Ownership of those industry-standard, flagship products (UCC-1, UCC-7, UCC-11, plus ACF2) made CA the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of OS/MVS security software with CA-Top Secret (#2 market share) and CA-ACF2 (#1 market share). IBM's Resource <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Facility</b> (RACF) product held the #3 market share position. On 24-May-2012, Jeffrey R. Yost, Ph.D. (conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/132470/oh404bs.pdf) interviewed Barry Schrager, one of ACF2's three original developers, who noted that: (a) When SKK was sold in 1986, ACF2 had a 60% market share while IBM’s RACF and CA’s Top Secret split the other 40%; and (b) Currently (2015), RACF has 75% market share while ACF2 and Top Secret from CA share the other 25 percent. UCCEL's acquisition also made Walter Haefner, that company's half-owner at the time, CA's largest individual shareholder—a distinction he enjoyed {{until his death in}} June 2012.|$|E

40|$|Transcript, 75 pp. Barry Schrager, {{who has a}} M. S. {{in applied}} {{mathematics}} from Northwestern University, is a seminal figure {{in the design and}} development of early commercial computer security software products. From 1968 to 1978 he served as Assistant Director of the University of Illinois-Chicago Circle Computer Center, where activity of student hackers on the center’s time-shared system led him to investigate methods and tools to achieve greater security. In the early 1970 s he became involved with IBM SHARE, and led a committee of emerging computer security experts – SHARE’s Data Security and Management Group. Schrager and his group’s 1974 SHARE white paper defined access control requirements to achieve security, which led to IBM’s 1976 computer security software product, Resource <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Facility</b> (RACF). Initially this product fell short of the requirements outlined in the white paper and Schrager and a colleague, Eberhard Klemens, developed a prototype <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Facility</b> (ACF) which met the requirements. In 1978 these two teamed up with Scott Krueger to found SKK, Inc. and refine this computer security software product as ACF 2 for its first customer London Life Insurance (Ontario, Canada). Soon thereafter SKK sold this product to General Motors and many other major corporations/organizations. ACF 2 became a billion dollar product that is now owned by Computer Associates. This oral history concentrates on Schrager’s work with SHARE, the creation of ACF 2, and his leadership of SKK, Inc.

Todays portal platforms provide some security functionality, mainly targeting at supporting a single-sign-on for the underlying applications. We argue that single-sign-on is not sufficient, {{but rather a}} mature security service is needed as a central authorization instance. As access control is needed on different levels of a portal architecture, only this allows an integrated approach to security management. We present CSAP (Communication Security, Authentication, and Privacy), a flexible security system for enterprise and e-government portals. CSAP was originally developed within the EU-funded research project Webocracy. Meanwhile, various enhancements to CSAP have been made, which are being discussed in this paper. The major enhancement is a Metadata-based <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>facility</b> (MBAC) which allows more flexibility in highly open and heterogeneous systems.

40|$|Computer {{security}} auditing {{constitutes an}} important part of any orga-nization’s security procedures. Because of the many inadequacies of the currently used manual methods, thorough and timely auditing is often difficult to attain. The recent literature suggests that expert sys-tem techniques can offer significant benefits when applied to security procedures such as risk analysis, security auditing, and intrusion detec-tion. This chapter presents an example of a novel expert system appli-cation, an expert system for security auditing (AudES). Issues in the development and use of the expert system that are unique to the appli-cation domain are discussed. The importance of effective computer security measures has become increasingly evident with the advent of recently publicized intrusion at-tempts and virus attacks. Any organization implementing computer se-curity policies is faced {{with a wide range of}} potential threats. Although some types of threats can be effectively countered using real-time methods (Anderson 1980; Denning 1987; Lunt and Jagannathan 1988), detection of others remains too time or resource intensive to address in real time. After-the-fact security auditing is frequently used to detect anomalous events that fall out of the scope of real-time securi-ty measures. A landmark study by Anderson (1980) suggests that exter-From: IAAI- 90 Proceedings. Copyright © 1990, AAAI (www. aaai. org).

Some recent literature indicates that AI techniques (expert system methods in particular) might have much to offer computer security practitioners (Summers and Kurzban 1988; Lunt 1988). The AudES ex-pert system is an experiment in investigating potential expert system applications in the area of computer security auditing. It is designed to automate manual security auditing procedures and alleviate the bur-den on human auditors.
