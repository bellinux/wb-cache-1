500|$|The Ambrose {{leader cable}} was an <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> {{with a single}} {{internal}} conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the Channel floor. It originated at Fort Lafayette (near the present day Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), then extended 16 miles down the Ambrose Channel to the vicinity of Lightship Ambrose offshore. [...] It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500Hz (cycles per second) current at 400volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field {{along the length of}} the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away. [...] The current was mechanically keyed to send the word [...] "NAVY" [...] in Morse Code.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{successful}} tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The minelayer Ord laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and <b>armored</b> <b>cable,</b> 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable. [...] The USS O'Brien was fitted with receiving equipment {{and attempted to}} follow the cable out of the Channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where {{a break in the}} cable prevented the signal from continuing. [...] The break in the cable was repaired, but {{over the course of the}} winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable. [...] Going back to the drawing board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable. [...] The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCrystalline rocks {{aquifers}} {{are often}} difficult to characterize since flows are mainly localized in few fractures. Inparticular, the geometry and the connections of the main flow paths are often only partly constrained with classicalhydraulic tests. Here, we show through few examples how heat {{can be used to}} characterize groundwaterflows in fractured rocks at the borehole, inter-borehole and watershed scale. Estimating flows from temperaturemeasurements requires heat advection to be the dominant process of heat transport, but this condition is generallymet in fractured rock at least within the few structures where flow is highly channelized. At the borehole scale,groundwater temperature variations with depth can be used to locate permeable fractures and to estimates boreholeflows. Measurements can be done with classical multi-parameters probes, but also with recent technologies such asFiber Optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (FO-DTS) which allows to measure temperature over long distanceswith an excellent spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, we show how a distributed borehole flowmeter canbe achieved using an <b>armored</b> fiber-optic <b>cable</b> and measuring the difference in temperature between a heatedand unheated cable that {{is a function of the}} fluid velocity. At the inter-borehole scale, temperature changes duringcross-borehole hydraulic tests allow to identify the connections and the hydraulic properties of the main flowpaths between boreholes. At the aquifer scale, groundwater temperature may be monitored to record temperaturechanges and estimate groundwater origin. In the example chosen, the main water supply comes from a depth of atleast 300 meters through relatively deep groundwater circulation within a major permeable fault zone. The influenceof groundwater extraction is clearly identified through groundwater temperature monitoring. These examplesillustrate the advantages and limitations of using heat and groundwater temperature measurements for fracturedrock hydrology...|$|R

50|$|A {{remotely}} operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is a tethered underwater mobile device. This meaning {{is different from}} remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air. ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew aboard a vessel. They are common in deep water industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. They are linked to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly which sits {{on top of the}} ROV. The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an <b>armored</b> <b>cable</b> that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The pump is then used for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms where electric motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle’s capabilities. These may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound velocity, light penetration, and temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary {{drilling}}, with {{a string}} of drill pipe rotated {{from the top of the}} string, and drilling fluid pumped down through the pipe and back up around the pipe, is the main method of drilling for minerals, and it has also been used for ice drilling. The cuttings are removed from the fluid at the top of the hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an <b>armored</b> <b>cable.</b> These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes. In the deeper holes, a drilling fluid will be used for both hole stability and cuttings removal, although the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly rather than circulated to the top of the hole. The fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in a chamber above the core. When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E
