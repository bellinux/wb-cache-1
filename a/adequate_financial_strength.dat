In turn, a measure of <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> is built, including indicators of capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity. Most importantly, our results indicate that banks with higher corporate governance indices exhibit higher <b>financial</b> <b>strength...</b>|$|R

More specifically, we examine how asymmetric <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> between the partners influences IJV termination in emerging economies, {{and consider the}} asymmetry direction {{as well as the}} local partner’s equity stake as contingency factors. Our event history analysis of 119 IJVs formed in Brazil shows that asymmetric <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> increases the likelihood of termination. However, notably, the findings reveal that higher local partner <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> is less harmful to IJV performance than lower local partner <b>financial</b> <b>strength.</b> Moreover, under both conditions, IJV performance is better when the highest equity stake is attributed to the local partner...|$|R
40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating {{indicates}} the fundamental <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> of a bank. The aim of <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating is to measure a bank’s fundamental <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> excluding the external factors. External factors can {{stem from the}} working environment or can be linked with the outside protective support mechanisms. With the evaluation, the rating of a bank free from outside supportive factors is being sought. Also the financial fundamental, franchise value, the variety of assets and working environment of a bank are being evaluated in this context. In this study, a model has been developed in order to predict the <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating of Turkish banks. The methodology {{of this study is}} as follows: Selecting variables {{to be used in the}} model, creating a data set, choosing the techniques to be used and the evaluation of classification success of the techniques. It is concluded that the artificial neural network system shows a better performance in terms of classification of <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating in comparison to multivariate statistical methods in the raining set. On the other hand, there is no meaningful difference could be found in the validation set in which the prediction performances of the employed techniques are tested...|$|R

40|$|First, {{the study}} {{attempts}} {{to know the}} capacity and willingness to pay the water charges based on the water productivity of the farmers of newly formed Canal Irrigation Cooperatives in Dharoi Irrigation Project in Gujarat being developed by Development Support Centre and AKRSP, Ahmedabad. The broad objective {{of this study is}} to use a new approach to help investigate the sustainability of irrigation cooperatives, especially small holding and ability of the farmers to pay the water fees determined by Irrigation Cooperatives (IC). The study tries to identify and analyze the critical factors for financial success or failure of canal irrigation co-operatives, assess the capacity of the farmers to pay and elicit the conscious steps taken by the government and farmers for ensuring the <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> of ICs. Research found that IC can help improve livelihoods. However, the sustainability of cooperatives largely depends on the fee collection efficiency and proper maintenance and repair of the canal network. <b>Adequate</b> <b>financial</b> planning to address these costs is key to the success of Irrigation co- operatives.

40|$|The initial {{matching}} {{relationships between}} underwriters and bonds/issuing firms and the certification quality of underwriters, {{as determined by}} changes in the issuing firm’s <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> post issue, are the two primary research topics in this dissertation. Based on total underwriter syndicate market share, two distinct categories, low market power (LMP) syndicates and high market power (HMP) syndicates were defined. Firm <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> is examined based on a new factor developed in this research. A comparison of the two underwriting categories, or pools, indicates that the HMP underwriters take on firms of lower initial <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> and additionally, the issuing firms decline more in <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> two years following bond issuance than do firms using LMP underwriters. Notwithstanding these results, the more interesting findings are the relationships within each of these pools. In the LMP pool of underwriters, financially stronger firms used the larger LMPs to underwrite their bonds, while the weaker firms used smaller LMPs. In contrast, among HMP underwriters, the largest HMPs aligned with the firms of relatively lower <b>financial</b> <b>strength.</b> The relationships in both pools reverse when changes in <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> are examined. Larger LMPs are associated with greater issuing firm financial decline while larger HMPs correlate {{with lower levels of}} decline in firm <b>financial</b> <b>strength.</b> Divergent patterns in initial underwriter-issuer matching and underwriter certification found in this research indicate that there are true differences in the “small” underwriting syndicates as compared to the larger syndicates. These patterns should be considered by both issuing firms and investors as both constituencies contemplate the corporate bond market...|$|R

40|$|Initial public {{offering}} (IPO) <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> measures are created to examine both the initial underpricing and aftermarket performance of firms in an emerging market. We {{find that the}} initial underpricing is positively related to <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> as proxied by cash flow and sales. Since bond ratings do not exist in Mauritius, a return-to-risk meas ure and Altman's z-score serve as proxies for <b>financial</b> <b>strength.</b> Using these measures, the aftermarket performance results indicate that net income is more higbly valued for strong firms. When net income is separated into dividends and earnings retained, we find dividends are valued more highly than earnings retained for firms in Mauritius...|$|R
