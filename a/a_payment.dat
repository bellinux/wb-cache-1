40|$|Recently, Scholten and Read (2014) {{found new}} {{violations}} of dominance in intertemporal choice. Although adding a small receipt before <b>a</b> delayed <b>payment</b> or adding <b>a</b> small delayed receipt after an immediate receipt makes the prospect objectively better, it decreases {{the preference for}} that prospect (better is worse). Conversely, although adding <b>a</b> small <b>payment</b> before <b>a</b> delayed receipt or adding <b>a</b> small delayed <b>payment</b> after <b>an</b> immediate <b>payment</b> makes the prospect objectively worse, it increases the preference for that prospect (worse is better). Scholten and Read explained these violations {{in terms of a}} preference for improvement. However, to produce violations such as these, we find that the temporal sequences need not be constructed as Scholten and Read suggested. In this study, adding a small receipt before a dated receipt (thus constructed as improving) or adding a receipt after <b>a</b> dated <b>payment</b> (thus constructed as improving) decreases preferences for those prospects.

His lawyer, who got him off third-degree burglary charges and several acquittals, also negotiated <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> of $20,000 to Gorney from Harriman for {{the pain and suffering}} of the amputated leg, despite the attempted crime he was shot for.

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, {{the public}} {{prosecution}} {{department of the}} city of Augsburg obtained the calendars of Karlheinz Schreiber, a German arms dealer. With the help of the documents, the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements, leading to Kiep. On 4 November 1999, the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep, charging him with having accepted <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> of one million Deutsche Marks from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes. After turning himself in a day later, Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money, with Horst Weyrauch present, as a donation for the CDU. This started the CDU donations scandal, in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered. On 30 November, former chancellor Helmut Kohl took full responsibility for the accounts and later admitted to having personally accepted a total sum of up to two million Deutsche Marks from anonymous sponsors, which were not declared. As a consequence of the illegal proceedings, the CDU was sentenced to <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> of 41 million Deutsche Marks by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse on 15 February 2000. Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion. One was closed in January 2004, after Kiep paid a monetary condition of 75,000 Euro. In another trial in 2001, he was sentenced to pay 45,000 Deutsche Marks. In early 2004, Kiep accepted a sentence of 40,500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal.|$|E

Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so {{it is evident that}} some accommodation had been reached by that time.
