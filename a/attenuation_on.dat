These waves are reflected and attenuated {{on the ground as}} well as within the ionospheric D layer, near 70 km altitude during day time conditions, and near 90 km height during the night. Reflection and <b>attenuation</b> <b>on</b> the ground depends on frequency, distance, and orography.

50|$|The {{pollutant}} species {{black carbon}} appears gray or black {{due to the}} absorption of electromagnetic energy by partially mobile electrons in the graphitic microstructure of the black carbon particles. This absorption is purely ‘resistive’ and displays no resonant bands: consequently, the material appears gray rather than colored. The attenuation of light transmitted through a deposit of these particles increases linearly with {{the frequency of the}} electromagnetic radiation, i.e. inversely with respect to wavelength. Aethalometer measurements of optical <b>attenuation</b> <b>on</b> a filter deposit will increase at shorter wavelengths as λ(-α) where the parameter α (the Angstrom exponent) has the value α = 1 for ‘gray’ or ‘black’ materials. However, other species may be co-mingled with the black carbon particles. Aromatic organic compounds associated with tobacco smoke and biomass smoke from wood-burning are known to have increased optical absorption at shorter wavelengths in the yellow, blue and near-ultraviolet portions of the spectrum.|$|E
50|$|When {{optical fibers}} {{are exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation such as energetic electrons, protons, neutrons, X-rays, Ƴ-radiation, etc., they undergo 'damage'. The term 'damage' primarily refers to the additional loss of the propagating optical signal leading to decreased power at the output end {{which could lead to}} premature failure of the component and or system. In the professional literature, the effect is often named Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA). The loss of power or 'darkening' occurs because the chemical bonds forming the optical fiber core are disrupted by the impinging high energy resulting in the appearance of new electronic transition states giving rise to additional absorption in the wavelength regions of interest. Once radiation source is removed, the fiber returns to its original state to some extent (a process called recovery). The extent of damage is governed by the balance between defect generation (excess <b>attenuation)</b> <b>on</b> one hand and defect annihilation (recovery) on the other hand. If the dose rate is low, an equilibrium state (between attenuation and recovery) is reached with some degree of darkening. On the contrary if the dose rate is high, the utility of fiber depends on the overall induced attenuation and the recovery time. Understanding these radiation induced effects is important particularly for space based applications where optical fibers are being considered for use in increasing number of applications.|$|E
