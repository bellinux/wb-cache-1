25|$|German armour-piercing shells {{were far}} more {{effective}} than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a picric <b>acid</b> <b>mixture</b> (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} sodium {{hydrogen}} phosphate/citric <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures</b> on enhancing phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil by alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) {{and the changes}} of metal availability in soils were investigated. Alfalfa plants grew healthily in heavy metals-contaminated soils (collected from molybdenum mine) for 30 days. The heavy metal content was determined by ICP-OES. In this paper, it was found that: the phytoextraction efficiency of alfalfa plants was enhanced after the sodium hydrogen phosphate/citric <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures</b> were added into soil. As usual, the phosphorus can promote plants to accumulate more biomass (increasing 0. 35 %- 24. 62 %) even if the availability of metals to extraction were increased by citric acid in the soil. With the treatment of sodium hydrogen phosphate/citric <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures,</b> the bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of alfalfa plants and the acid soluble fractions of heavy metals in soils were increased. The translocation factor (TF) values of all alfalfas in heavy metals were low, but the TF of As, Cr, Hg, Mo tended to increase with sodium hydrogen phosphate/citric <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures.</b> In other words, both the availability and the biological-validity of heavy metals in soils were increased after sodium hydrogen phosphate/citric <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures</b> were added into soils...|$|R

Influence of foliar {{application}} of algae extract and amino <b>acids</b> <b>mixture</b> on fenugreek plants in sandy and clay soils. Nusantara Bioscience 7 : 33 - 37. Two pot experiments {{were conducted to}} study the effect of {{foliar application}} of algae extract and amino <b>acids</b> <b>mixture</b> on the growth and chemical constituents of fenugreek plants (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.). Plants were sprayed with different concentrations of algae extract (0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0 g/L) or equivalent of amino <b>acids</b> <b>mixture</b> (0. 0, 0. 625, 1. 25 g/L). The results indicated that foliar application of amino <b>acids</b> <b>mixture</b> enhanced the vegetative growth of fenugreek plants, especially when plants were sprayed with 1. 25 g/L amino <b>acids</b> <b>mixture.</b> Data also show that total nitrogen, essential oil percentage and yield followed the same trend. These results hold true for plants cultivated in either clay soil or sandy soil. Data also indicated that foliar application of algae extract to fenugreek plants significantly increased plant height, number of leaves, number of branches and fresh and dry weights of plant at vegetative growth stage and flowering stage of fenugreek plant, especially in plants treated with 5 g/L algae extract in sandy and clay soils, respectively. Treatment of fenugreek plants with algae extract markedly increased nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium contents, especially at 5 g/L. ...|$|R

2500|$|The German {{scientist}} Johann Christian Poggendorff {{overcame the}} problems with separating the electrolyte and the depolariser using a porous earthenware pot in 1842. [...] In the Poggendorff cell, sometimes called Grenet Cell due to the works of Eugene Grenet around 1859, the electrolyte was dilute sulphuric acid and the depolariser was chromic acid. The two acids were physically mixed together eliminating the porous pot. The positive electrode (cathode) was two carbon plates, with a zinc plate (negative or anode) positioned between them. Because of the tendency of the <b>acid</b> <b>mixture</b> to react with the zinc, a mechanism was provided to raise the zinc electrode clear of the acids.|$|E

The viscosity behavior of this polymer in benzene/dichloroacetic <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures</b> (c= 0, 2. 10 - 3 - 1, 4. 10 - 3 g/cm 3) at 25 °CC is investigated. The results are compared with measurements on poly(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate), PBLG, (poly[L-imino- 1 -(2 -benzyloxycarbonylethyl) - 2 -oxoethylene]), (1 c) {{under the same}} conditions. A transition from a rigid hydrogen bonded helix to a random solvated coil occurs in two stages for both: PBPLG (first stage 0 - 55 %, second stage 55 - 100 % dichloroacetic acid) and PBLG (first stage 0 - 70 %, second stage 70 - 100 % dichloroacetic acid). Therefore, {{the introduction of a}} p-phenyl substituent in PBLG leads to a less stable helix in benzene/dichloroacetic <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The stability and viscosity behavior of PBLG in benzene/dichloroacetic <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures</b> (c= 0, 2. 10 - 3 - 1, 4. 10 - 3 g/cm 3) is quite similar to the behavior of PBLG in m-cresol/dichloroacetic <b>acid</b> <b>mixtures</b> (c= 1, 0. 10 - 3 - 4, 0. 10 - 3 g/cm 3) ...|$|R

40|$|Taste {{preferences}} of marble goby (Oxyeleotris marmoratus) for a mixture and several single L-isomer amino acids were determined through behavioral tests. Agar gel pellet {{was used as}} the medium to deliver the amino acids, and the fish acceptance on these pellets was evaluated by calculating the acceptance index (total pellet ingested/total pellet given; maximum and minimum values are 1 and 0, respectively). O. marmoratus were found to moderately accept L-alanine, L-glycine, and L-glutamine (index values 0. 38, 0. 32, and 0. 27, respectively) but reject L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-serine and taurine (index value 0). The amino <b>acids</b> <b>mixture</b> (AAM) showed the highest acceptance (0. 91) by the fish.

2500|$|Vespa amino <b>acid</b> <b>mixture</b> is a {{nutritional}} supplement consisting of larval saliva sold {{with the intent}} of improving endurance during exercise. Several companies in Asia and Europe have begun to manufacture dietary supplements and energy drinks which contain synthetic versions of secretions of the larvae of V. mandarinia, which the adult hornets usually consume. The manufacturers of these products make claims that consuming the larval hornet secretions (marketed as [...] "hornet juice") will enhance human endurance because of the effect it has on adult hornets' performance. During laboratory testing on mice, increased lipolysis (metabolism of fat) was observed in rat adipocytes (fat cells) alongside improved swimming endurance, decreased lactate, and increased glucose concentration in the blood stream. While testing on mice has produced optimistic outcomes, trial tests on humans were inconclusive. Ten trained cyclists were given either an 80 ml serving of the mixture or a sports-drink placebo. Variables tested included the time to complete the 20km race, peak power, average power, maximum heart rate, and average heart rate. Participants who consumed it had significantly lower maximum heart rates, but no other statistically significant changes were seen.|$|E
