5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

500|$|On {{the way to}} the Beechcraft, Eko and Charlie find a {{parachute}} in a tree, which leads to the corpse of a Nigerian man dressed as a priest that Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) had previously found. When Eko sees the dead man's gold tooth, he tells Charlie that the man [...] "saved his life." [...] Charlie loses his way, and Mr. Eko tells him to climb a tree. As he is above the tree, explosions and a cloud of black smoke emerge from the jungle. It confronts him whilst flashing images to him of his past. Mr. Eko stands his ground, despite Charlie telling him to run, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smoke before it pulls back and disappears. Eko and Charlie then find the plane, inside which Eko finds another corpse which Eko recognizes as Yemi. After taking the cross from Yemi's body, Eko tells Charlie that it is his brother, gives Charlie a Virgin Mary statue [...] "for the one [...] broke" [...] and sets the plane on fire. Charlie asks Eko if he is a priest himself, and as Eko puts the cross around his neck he replies [...] "Yes, I am." [...] The two then recite Psalm 23 from the Old Testament as the plane burns.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
6000|$|... (After {{giving it}} to ASHER, DR. JONATHAN takes his stand beside [...] MINNIE, {{who is at the}} back of the room, near the bench. He lays a [...] hand on her arm. ASHER tears open the {{envelope}} <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] telegram, his hands trembling.) ...|$|E

60|$|The {{friendly}} movers {{might not}} have been quite at their ease, even though the visitor had entered in the usual manner. But, leaning on the breast-high window, and staring in out of the darkness, they find the visitor extremely embarrassing. Especially Mr Venus: who removes his pipe, draws back his head, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> starer, as if it were his own Hindoo baby come to fetch him home.|$|E
60|$|For Tom-all-Alone's and Lincoln's Inn Fields {{persist in}} {{harnessing}} themselves, {{a pair of}} ungovernable coursers, to the chariot of Mr. Snagsby's imagination; and Mr. Bucket drives; and the passengers are Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn; and the complete equipage whirls though the law-stationery business at wild speed all round the clock. Even in the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken, it rattles away at a smoking pace from the dinner-table, when Mr. Snagsby pauses in carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kitchen wall.|$|E
60|$|The {{ponderous}} {{woman looked}} through the pattern of falling words at the flowers standing cool, firm, and upright in the earth, with a curious expression. She saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and {{closes his eyes and}} opens them, and seeing the brass candlestick again, finally starts broad awake <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> candlestick with all his powers. So the heavy woman came to a standstill opposite the oval-shaped flower bed, and ceased even to pretend to listen to what the other woman was saying. She stood there letting the words fall over her, swaying the top part of her body slowly backwards and forwards, looking at the flowers. Then she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Butterwell {{dropped the}} paper from his hands, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{secretary}} over his spectacles.|$|R
60|$|Karain {{covered the}} handle of his kriss in sign of respect, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowned head.|$|R
60|$|The sailor {{took his}} newly-lighted pipe from {{between his lips}} <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Captain in astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few moments}} before a horse jumps it slows, sidles, gathers itself together, goes {{up like a}} monster wave, and pitches down on the further side. Hedges and sky swoop in a semicircle. Then as if your own body ran into the horse's body and it was your own forelegs grown with his that sprang, rushing through the air you go, the ground resilient, bodies a mass of muscles, yet you have command too, upright stillness, eyes {{accurately}} judging. Then the curves cease, changing to downright hammer strokes, which jar; and you draw up with a jolt; sitting back a little, sparkling, tingling, glazed with ice over pounding arteries, gasping: [...] "Ah! ho! Hah!" [...] the steam going up from the horses as they jostle together at the cross-roads, where the signpost is, and {{the woman in the}} apron stands <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> doorway. The man raises himself from the cabbages to stare too.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile {{it occurs}} to me that by a remote New England fireside an unsophisticated young person of either sex is reading in an old volume of travels or an old romantic tale some account of these anniversaries and {{appointed}} revels as old Catholic lands offer them to view. Across the page swims a vision of sculptured palace-fronts draped in crimson and gold and shining in a southern sun; of a motley train of maskers sweeping on in voluptuous confusion and pelting each other with nosegays and love-letters. Into the quiet room, quenching the rhythm of the Connecticut clock, floats an uproar of delighted voices, a medley of stirring foreign sounds, an echo of far-heard music of a strangely alien cadence. But the dusk is falling, and the unsophisticated young person closes the book wearily and wanders to the window. The dusk is falling on the beaten snow. Down the road is a white wooden meeting-house, looking grey among the drifts. The young person surveys the prospect a while, and then wanders back <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire. The Carnival of Venice, of Florence, of Rome; colour and costume, romance and rapture! The young person gazes in the firelight at the flickering chiaroscuro of the future, discerns at last the glowing phantasm of opportunity, and determines with a wild heart-beat to go and see it all--twenty years hence! ...|$|E
50|$|In the court, Khan Girey sits, devastated, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fountain of Tears, as {{his orders}} are carried out.|$|E
60|$|Kennedy went across, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ghastly head {{which lay}} loosely on the {{shredded}} and mouldering mitre.|$|R
60|$|The worthy coast-guard-man {{scratched}} his nose <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shingle for some minutes before venturing to reply.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of}} the {{staircase}} I stood <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> worn steps, <b>and</b> Ayesha, turning, saw me.|$|R
50|$|Actor Nick Offerman {{released}} {{his own version}} of The Yule Log on December 2, 2015 in the style of his character Ron Swanson, from the television series Parks and Recreation. Offerman pours a glass of Lagavulin single malt scotch whiskey as the Yule Log fire plays <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera for 45 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{sixth and}} final chapter doesn't follow any {{specific}} character. Elizabeth's personality has finally solidified, {{and she gets}} her first-ever haircut. That night, she, along with her aunt and the doctor, re-visit the Arrows' home, where Elizabeth goes into the garden <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky. They leave, and Elizabeth announces that she is happy.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Clara {{finds herself}} {{back in her}} bedroom. She tells her aunt about the mice and her doll being missing, but Gerda insists talking {{nonsense}} and is ill with a fever. In her delirious state, Clara goes down {{to the living room}} <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> grandfather clock. Thinking she sees Uncle Drosselmeyer inside, she climbs in, only to be scared by the Ragman.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{stiffened}} {{his fingers}} on <b>the</b> rifle <b>at</b> his hip, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last figure with growing astonishment.|$|R
60|$|Evan, who {{was also}} leaning over the edge, swung round with startling suddenness <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other's back.|$|R
60|$|Jean saw Ellen {{catch the}} blouse {{and try to}} wrap it around her, while she sagged against <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. The hoof beats pounded to a solid thumping halt just outside.|$|R
50|$|The video {{features}} the band {{playing in the}} street in front of what appears to be a warehouse. Many people pass by as if nothing is happening. Near the end of the song, several colored balloons come out of a gutter and the warehouse's doors open, letting more and more balloons out. All the people seen in the video stop and look upwards to the balloons. The video ends when the band stops playing <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> balloons as well.|$|E
5000|$|The shot {{changes to}} Ciara, who is {{shopping}} for clothes at mini mall and see two [...] "haters" [...] gossiping about Shawn Jay. Shawn Jay's girlfriend is in a dressing room and overhears {{all of this}} nonsense. Soon as the chorus stats playing towards the end she quickly pulls the curtains away <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two [...] "haters". She then confronts Shawn Jay about what the two [...] "haters" [...] were talking about. He denies it all through his rap, but she eventually left the store.|$|E
5000|$|The audio used in Dramatic Chipmunk {{is taken}} from the score of the 1974 Mel Brooks film Young Frankenstein, which was {{composed}} by two-time Oscar nominee (and longtime Brooks collaborator) John Morris, and orchestrated by Morris and EGOT recipient Jonathan Tunick. It uses three dramatic chords (A minor, C minor, and E minor) performed in full orchestral tutti, and has a rumble of thunder in the background. The [...] "chipmunk" [...] turns its head <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera with a [...] "surprised" [...] look while the music is played.|$|E
60|$|The exclamation was so {{pronounced}} that it awoke Hal, and {{the youth}} {{opened his eyes}} wide, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man.|$|R
