5|$|Females {{predominantly}} scent mark {{with their}} anogenital scent glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that of 92 potentially possible modes of life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — no more than a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found any evidence of a collision.|$|E

5|$|On March 14, 1980, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007, an Ilyushin Il-62, {{attempted}} a go-around when the crew experienced troubles with a gear indicator. When thrust was applied, the low pressure turbine disc in engine number 2 disintegrated because of material fatigue; {{parts of the}} disc damaged engines number 1 and 3 and severed control pushers for both horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> stabilizers. After 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft crashed, killing all 87 people on board.|$|E

During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E

5|$|According to Chapter I, Article 28, {{paragraph}} 2 of the Constitution, {{the national}} colors of Poland are white and red. The Coat of Arms Act, Article 4, further specifies that {{the colors are}} white and red in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one is white and the bottom one is red. If the colors are displayed vertically, the white stripe {{is placed on the}} left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> alignment, as well as the official shades of both colors expressed as coordinates in the CIE xyY (CIE 1931) color space with the tolerated color differences (ΔE) specified in the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space (CIELUV).|$|E
5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> shear.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{to solve the problem}} of non-additivity {{revealed}} by the works that calculate the redistributive effect of the budget or public policies made up of different instruments of income or public spending. We use Shapley’s value to do this. This technique allows us to decompose the redistributive effect <b>and</b> the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal effects consistently and not arbitrarily. The main result obtained for the case of taxes and social transfers in the US is that previous calculations undervalued the redistributive effects <b>and</b> their <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal components for taxes and transfers.

5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E
