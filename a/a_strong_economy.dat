5|$|Salford {{became a}} major factory town and inland port during the 18th and 19th centuries. Cotton and silk {{spinning}} and weaving in local mills attracted an influx of families and provided Salford with <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>economy.</b> Salford Docks was a principal dockyard of the Manchester Ship Canal. By {{the end of the}} 19th century Salford had an enlarged working class community and suffered from chronic overpopulation. Industrial activities declined during the 20th century however, causing a local economic depression. Salford subsequently became one of contrasts, with regenerated inner-city areas like Salford Quays next {{to some of the most}} socially deprived and violent areas in England.|$|E
5|$|Trafford has <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>economy</b> {{with low}} levels of {{unemployment}} and contains both Trafford Park industrial estate and the Trafford Centre, a large out-of-town shopping centre.

Socially, the area includes both working class areas like Old Trafford and Stretford and middle class ones such as Bowdon and Hale. Altrincham and Sale West is one of the five parliamentary constituencies in Greater Manchester to be held by the Conservative Party, the others being Bury North, Hazel Grove, Cheadle and Bolton West.|$|E

5|$|The fusion effort {{failed and}} Grant was easily reelected. Liberal Republicans {{were unable to}} deliver many votes, and Greeley was only {{successful}} in areas the Democrats would have carried without him. Federal prosecution of the Klan, <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>economy,</b> debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 {{percent of the popular}} vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.|$|E
5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the Muslim world, on the other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>economy</b> and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E

25|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was very strong, {{maintained}} by emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, liberal use of military's coercive powers, and <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>economy.</b> Upon his retirement {{from the military}} in June 1976, Suharto undertook re-organization {{of the armed forces}} that concentrates power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces. A tough and capable soldier, Moerdani is also a Roman Catholic, which precluded him from posing a political threat to Suharto.|$|E

The Social Democrats, however, failed to capitalize on the economic boom. Opinion polls showed the party struggling to return to its post-election 36% approval level. Instead, the smaller Left Party, a Social Democrat ally, picked up support with its program of increased public spending and opposition to Swedish membership in the European single currency.|$|E

He established a strong central administration from Pataliputra (now Patna), patterned after Chanakya's text on governance and politics, the Arthashastra. Chandragupta's India was characterised by an efficient and highly organised structure. The empire built infrastructure such as irrigation, temples, mines and roads, leading to <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>economy.</b> With internal and external trade thriving and agriculture flourishing, the empire built a large and trained permanent army to help expand and protect its boundaries. Greek records suggest that art and city architecture thrived during his rule.

Indonesia, which had massive foreign reserves and was seen as having <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>economy,</b> responded on 11 July 1997, by widening its exchange rate band from 8 to 12%. Indonesia had taken similar actions in the years leading up to the crisis, in December 1995 from 2 to 3%, in response to the Mexican {{financial crisis}}, and in June and September 1996 from 3 to 5% and then 5 to 8%.
