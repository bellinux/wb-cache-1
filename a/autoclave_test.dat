This paper reports the behaviour of ACF joints under various mechanical loading, i. e., die shear and cyclic fatigue in shear. The mechanical behaviour of ACF joints that have been exposed to environmental effects, i. e., high moisture and elevated temperature (<b>autoclave</b> <b>test</b> conditions) has been examined using die shear test. The maximum shear force prior to fracture was determined as 465. 0 N, at which the contact resistance is found extremely high and can be considered as open circuits. Epoxy based ACF exhibits insignificant plastic deformation, especially for samples that have undergone <b>autoclave</b> <b>test.</b> Reduction trend was observed in the shear moduli over <b>autoclave</b> <b>test</b> time for ACF joints. Fracture surface of ACF that failed in shear test shows spalling and less plastic deformation after exposed to <b>autoclave</b> <b>test.</b> For cyclic fatigue test, the endurance limit is determined at about 143. 5 N and the corresponding calculated endurance ratio is around 32. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports that}} the {{stress-corrosion}} cracking induced by <b>autoclave</b> <b>test</b> condition reduces the mechanical strength of anisotropic conductive joints and also increases the contact resistance by allowing more moisture to reach the aluminium metallization. The use of anisotropic conductive joints with bumpless chips allows {{a reduction in the}} costs of the flip chip bonding process. The epoxy-based anisotropic conductive adhesive film (ACF) absorbs moisture and experiences hygroscopic swelling, hence degrading adhesion strength and elasticity in hazardous environments, e. g. if moisture at high vapour pressure, and test temperature near to its glassy temperature (Tg) are applied. Contact resistances also show an increasing trend that is similar to that typical of a corrosion process. It is most probably due to the formation of an oxidation layer on top of the aluminium metallization and to the hygroscopic swelling of the ACF. The elastic properties of ACF joints reduce by about 50 % after 384 h test time. In this study, 336 h of <b>autoclave</b> <b>test</b> is the critical test duration to affect the electrical and mechanical properties of an ACF joint...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{synthesis}} route {{was developed}} to produce exceptionally thermal stable SiBCN-based ceramics. This route {{turns out to be}} cheaper, simpler and faster than the conventional route. The SiBCN-based preceramic polymer was synthesized by using three monomers, trichlorosilane (HSiCl 3), boron trichloride (BCl 3), and hexamethydisilazane (HMDZ), at a molar ratio of about 1 : 1 : 4. The product becomes an amorphous structure with crosslinked bonds during the elimination of (CH 3) 3 SiCl. An intermolecular condensation with the loss of HMDZ occurs in a second stage without the addition of crosslinking agents. In the final pyrolysis stage, hydrogen-rich species such as CH 4 are lost.

Batch bench-scale <b>autoclave</b> <b>testing</b> with radioactive (actual) Tank 48 H waste is among the tests required in the WAO Technology Maturation Plan. The goal of the <b>autoclave</b> <b>testing</b> is to validate that the simulant being used for extensive WAO vendor testing adequately represents the Tank 48 H waste. The test objective was to demonstrate comparable test results when running simulated waste and real waste under similar test conditions. Specifically: (1) Confirm the TPB destruction efficiency and rate (same reaction times) obtained from comparable simulant tests, (2) Determine the destruction efficiency of other organics including biphenyl, (3) Identify and quantify the reaction byproducts, and (4) Determine off-gas composition. Batch bench-scale stirred <b>autoclave</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted with simulated and actual Tank 48 H wastes at SRNL. Experimental conditions were chosen based on continuous-flow pilot-scale simulant testing performed at Siemens Water Technologies Corporation (SWT) in Rothschild, Wisconsin. The following items were demonstrated {{as a result of this}} testing. (1) Tetraphenylborate was destroyed to below detection limits during the 1 -hour reaction time at 280 C. Destruction efficiency of TPB was > 99. 997 %. (2) Other organics (TPB associated compounds), except biphenyl, were destroyed to below their respective detection limits. Biphenyl was partially destroyed in the process, mainly due to its propensity to reside in the vapor phase during the WAO reaction. Biphenyl is expected to be removed in the gas phase during the actual process, which is a continuous-flow system. (3) Reaction byproducts, remnants of MST, and the PUREX sludge, were characterized in this work. Radioactive species, such as Pu, Sr- 90 and Cs- 137 were quantified in the filtrate and slurry samples. Notably, Cs- 137, boron and potassium were shown as soluble as a result of the WAO reaction. (4) Off-gas composition was measured in the resulting gas phase from the reaction. Benzene and hydrogen were formed during the reaction, but they were reasonably low in the off-gas at 0. 096 and 0. 0063 vol% respectively.

Thermoplastic composites compared with thermoset composites show a lot of advantages such as higher impact resistance, recyclability etc. and they are very suitable for primary structures of an aircraft. However, manufacturing of thermoplastic composites requires more efforts because of the very high viscosity of thermoplastic resin. This study proposed a manufacturing procedure to make flat thermoplastic laminates with different layup sequences by using a heated mandrel during layup process with AFP. It is shown that using a mandrel heated to a temperature higher than glass transition can make flat laminates. Processing parameters which consist of hot gas temperature, compaction force, layup speed, mandrel temperature, were found for different laminates. Moreover, repass after material deposition helps to reduce void content inside the laminates. The obtained flat laminates show the crystallized thermoplastic resin.

The failure mechanisms were studied from the fracture surface analysis. Moisture absorption and desorption studies at different aging time were carried out to understand the property changes due to moisture. The {{results show that the}} black oxide coating improved significantly the interfacial bond strength in the dry condition. The mechanical interlocking mechanism provided by the fibrillar copper oxide was mainly responsible for it. The interfacial bond strengths for all substrates remained almost unchanged after thermal ageing at 150 degreesC for 8 h. Thermal cycles between - 50 degreesC and 150 degreesC for 500 and 1000 thermal cycles exhibited generally a negligible influence or decreased slightly the interfacial adhesion. The hygrothermal ageing at 121 degreesC/ 100 % RH in an autoclave (i. e. PCT) resulted in large reductions in interfacial bond strength after the initial 48 h ageing and tended to level off with further ageing. Fracture analysis of tape peeled bare copper substrates after 500 cycles of thermal loading revealed a transition of failure mechanism from adhesive to cohesive failure. In contrast, the failure mechanism remained unchanged for oxide-coated substrates. The implications arising from the button shear and tape peel tests are different because of the different fracture modes involved. According to the available data discussed above, the PCT is regarded as the most severe test affecting the adhesion performance.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to understand the failure modes and mechanisms of adhesive materials used to flip-chip bond a silicon die onto a polyimide substrate. The bonding material investigated in {{this research}} is called Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF). This is a promising interconnection material and has gained extensive interest in the electronics packaging industry. Both the experimental and finite element analysis (FEA) methods were used in order to investigate the behaviour of the ACF materials when subjected to certain manufacturing and environmental testing conditions. The manufacturing condition investigated was a subsequent solder reflow process on an ACF flip-chip bonded device. The environmental testing condition investigated was the moisture test. For the manufacturing condition, both experimental and modelling results demonstrate the impact of a subsequent reflow process on the behaviour of the ACF joint. Typical failures observed after this process were cracks at the pad/particle interface. This failure mode was more sever with a higher peak reflow temperature. This was also found using FEA where high tensile stresses were predicted in these regions. FEA modelling was also used to help identify the mechanisms leading to these failures. This is primarily due to the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) miss-match in the materials and the elastic/plastic deformation behaviour of the conductive particle. Important design variables that can minimise these failures are the Young’s Modulus and CTE of the adhesive and the height of the hump on the die. For the environmental testing condition, an <b>autoclave</b> <b>test</b> at 121 °C, 100 %RH and pressure of 2 atm was used. More than 85 % of the ACF joints failed during the first 24 hours of testing. The failure mode observed was cracking along the interface between the adhesive and substrate and pad. A macro-micro modelling approach was used to help identify the mechanisms leading to these failures. It was found that most of the damage is caused by moisture diffusion and associated swelling. Important design variables that will help minimise this mode of failure are: Coefficient of Moisture Expansion (CME) and Young’s Modulus of the adhesive and the height of the bump on the die.

40|$|Delaminations {{at various}} {{interfaces}} {{are one of}} the most critical reliability issues in plastic packages. Delamination is formed as a result of the imperfect interface adhesion between the integrated circuit (IC) package components. Adhesion has been identified as one of the key factors to improve delamination related problems. A thorough understanding of substrate, surface coatings, polymeric materials, interface adhesion properties and hygrothermal effects on reliability performance of the packages are necessary in order to minimize the problem of delamination and the associated package cracking issue. Previous research works have focused on dimples to improve the interfacial bond strength without full consideration of the surface coatings and hygrothermal effects on interfacial adhesion. In the present investigation of interfacial adhesion improvement between lead frame and epoxy molding compound (EMC), special emphasis has been placed on: i) the effects of dimple and metallic coating and; ii) the effects of temperature and hygrothermal ageing excursions simulating the practical package assembly processes. Moreover, the extension of copper oxide coating technology from printed circuit board (PCB) to IC packages, especially for copper lead frame and the heat sink/substrate for tape ball grid array (TBGA) packages, have necessitated a more detailed study of characterization and optimization of black oxide coating material, effect of debled treatment and hygrothermal effect on interfacial adhesion. A study is made of the effects of dimple and metallic coatings by evaluating the surface characteristics, such as wettability, surface roughness and elemental compositions, which in turn are correlated with the maximum pull force measured from the lead pull tests. It is found that the dimples enhanced the maximum pull force through improved mechanical interlocking of molding compound, depending on the type of coating. The wettability of metal surface represented by the surface energy played a predominant role in controlling the interfacial adhesion. Hygrothermal ageing at 85 ℃/ 85 % RH followed by solder reflow process reduced the maximum pull force significantly especially for the hydrophilic and polar metal surfaces. The reduction in maximum pull force for hydrophilic surfaces is higher than hydrophobic surfaces. There was approximately a linear correlation between the reduction in interfacial bond strength and the differential work of adhesion between the dry and wet environments. The mechanical interlocking provided by dimples retained the interfacial adhesion in humid environment and stopped the propagation of delamination. In addition to the aforementioned metal plating and dimples, black copper oxide is another very useful chemical conversion coating for improved adhesion of copper with various polymers, and has been widely employed since the early days of printed circuit technology. The surface was characterized and it's thickness was optimized based on several state-of-the-art analytical instruments and interfacial adhesion study. The maximum shear force between the black oxide coated substrate and glob-top resin increased rapidly at a low range of oxide thickness, and became saturated at thicknesses greater than about 800 nm. There were functionally similar dependence of interfacial bond strength on oxide thickness, surface energy and surface roughness. A treatment for 150 sec is sufficient to produce a coating thickness with maximum adhesion with glob top resins. Mechanical hardening involved in the debleeding process consolidated the fibrillar cupric oxide into a flat surface, which reduced in turn both CuO/Cu 2 O ratio and the interfacial bond strength. Analysis of fracture surfaces indicated that cohesive failure occurred within the oxide layer for the black oxide coated substrate (cohesive failure), while fracture tended to occur along the coating-resin interface (adhesive failure) once the coated surface was processed with debleeding treatment. The presence of black oxide coating discouraged the moisture absorption, and encouraged the desorption of moisture within the coating. <b>Autoclave</b> <b>test</b> (or pressure cooker test, PCT), is regarded as the most severe test affecting the adhesion performance. The major contributions of this thesis are: i) to incorporate dimple and metallic coatings under hygrothermal conditions and to study its interfacial adhesion strength; ii) to report that the improvement in the interfacial adhesion due to dimples was higher for the coatings with inherently weak interfacial adhesion than those with inherently strong adhesion characteristic; iii) to study the correlation between interfacial adhesion and differential work of adhesion at dry and wet condition of metallic coatings; iv) to report the correlation between the work of adhesion difference and polar surface energy of metallic coatings; v) to report that dimples retains the interfacial adhesion under humid environment; and; vi) to compare the surface characteristics and interfacial adhesion of as-received black oxide and debled black oxide under different oxidation treatment time and hygrothermal conditions...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic {{conductive}} film (ACF) {{which consists}} of an adhesive epoxy matrix and randomly distributed conductive particles are widely used as the connection material for electronic devices with high I/O counts. However, for the semiconductor industry {{the reliability of the}} ACF is still a major concern {{due to a lack of}} experimental reliability data. This paper reports the investigations into the moisture-induced failures in Flip-Chip-on-Flex interconnections with Anisotropic Conductive Films (ACFs). Both experimental and modeling methods were applied. In the experiments, the contact resistance was used as a quality indicator and was measured continuously during the accelerated <b>tests</b> (<b>autoclave</b> <b>tests).</b> The temperature, relative humidity and the pressure were set at 121 °C, 100 %RH, and 2 atm respectively. The contact resistance of the ACF joints increased during the tests and nearly 25 % of the joints were found to be open after 168 hours’ testing time. Visible conduction gaps between the adhesive and substrate pads were observed. Cracks at the adhesive/flex interface were also found. For a better understanding of the experimental results, 3 -D Finite Element (FE) models were built and a macro-micro modeling method was used to determine the moisture diffusion and moisture-induced stresses inside the ACF joints. Modeling results are consistent with the findings in the experimental work...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCO 2 flue gases {{acquired}} from different sources contain {{a significant amount}} of impurities and water, which are corrosive to the pipeline steel. To design the pipelines for large scale of CO 2 flue gas transport, the corrosion of pipeline steels has to be investigated in the realistic conditions. In this paper, corrosion behaviour of steel S 355 and stainless steel 316 L in CO 2 flue gas solutions has been investigated using electrochemical techniques in an autoclave. The corrosion rates of the steels in different environments were measured by polarization and mass loss measurements. The corrosion morphology and products on the steel surface were analyzed by photo- and electron microscope and x-ray diffraction, respectively. Three types of polymer coatings on the steel S 355 have been studied in 3. 5 % NaCl solution plus CO 2 in the autoclave at 100 bar and 60 °C. The corrosion resistance of the coatings has been measured by electrochemical impedance measurements. The structures and the adhesion of the coatings before and after the <b>autoclave</b> <b>tests</b> have been investigated using microscope and pull-off test. The results show that the Coating B has better corrosion resistance than the other two types of coatings, which is a good candidate for internal coatings of a pipeline...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{verification}} of boron species in fuel CRUD (Chalk River Unidentified Deposit) would provide essential and important {{information about the}} root cause of CRUD-induced power shifts (CIPS). To date, only bonaccordite and elemental boron were reported to exist in fuel CRUD in CIPS-troubled pressurized water reactor (PWR) cores and lithium tetraborate to exist in simulated PWR fuel CRUD from some <b>autoclave</b> <b>tests.</b> We have reevaluated previous analysis of similar threadlike crystals along with examining some similar threadlike crystals from CRUD samples collected from a PWR cycle that had no indications of CIPS. These threadlike crystals have a typical [Ni]/[Fe] atomic ratio of ∼ 2 and similar crystal morphology as the one (bonaccordite) reported previously. In addition to electron diffraction study, we have applied electron energy loss spectroscopy to determine boron content in such a crystal and found a good agreement with that of bonaccordite. Surprisingly, such crystals seem to appear also on corroded surfaces of Alloy 600 that was exposed to simulated PWR primary water with a dissolved hydrogen level of 5  mL H 2 /kg H 2 O, but absent when exposed under 75  mL H 2 /kg H 2 O condition. It remains to be verified as to what extent and in which chemical environment this phase would be formed in PWR primary systems...|$|R

Visible conduction gaps between the adhesive and substrate pads were observed. Cracks at the adhesive/flex interface were also found. It is believed that the swelling effect of the adhesive and the water penetration along the adhesive/flex interface are the main causes of this contact degradation. Another finding from the experimental work was that the ACF interconnections that had undergone the reflow treatment were more sensitive to the moisture and showed worse reliability during the tests.
