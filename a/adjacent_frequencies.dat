40|$|OFDM/OQAM is spectrally {{efficient}} multicarrier (MC) system, robust to mobile channel (time and frequency) variability {{thanks to}} pulse shaping. In this contribution, pulse shaping with discrete non-orthogonal pulse based on Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (DPSS), is proposed. DPSS, {{being the most}} concentrated pulse out of all sequences of the same length, is the natural choice for pulse shaping. The novelty of the analysis lies in the discovery of quasi-orthogonality property of DPSS to its time and frequency shifts. DPSS pulse analysis shows that this property is valid {{in the case of}} short pulse of the single MC symbol length. MC/OQAM system performance with DPSS and other pulses types is analyzed by simulation confirming the quasi-orthogonality of DPSS. The advantage of using the most concentrated pulse is shown in terms of interference that two MC/OQAM systems in <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> bands cause one to another. Simulations also show that DPSS permits smaller frequency separation between systems that are allocated <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> bands. 1...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} in <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> channels can interfere each other. In this report {{it has been}} investigated how this interference can be minimized for the 2. 6 GHz frequency band. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs intends to issue begin 2008 spectrum licenses for this band. A good method to minimize interference is a Block Edge Mask (BEM). A BEM dictates the maximum transmit power in the awarded frequency spectrum. In practical systems {{it is nearly impossible}} to transmit only in the awarded spectrum. A small part of the transmit power is transmitted in <b>adjacent</b> <b>frequency</b> channels and also receivers have limited channel selectivity. For this reason, a BEM not only dictates the maximum in-band transmit power, but also defines the maximum transmit power outside the awarded frequency spectrum. An important parameter for constructing the BEM is frequency efficiency. The 3 GPP standards and the proposals of other countries have been used as a starting point. There are two frequency bands where spectrum licenses will be issued, 2010 to 2019. 7 MHz and 2500 – 2690 MHz...|$|R
