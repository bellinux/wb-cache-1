Dynamic and static {{frequency}} of the rotor about diameter of 1. 4 m small {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} was tested by using PULSE 16. 1 structural vibration analysis system., through combining the data of static frequency to identify rotor Dynamic frequency using spectrum analysis method. The conclusions found that, at a yaw condition of constant rotor speed, vibration acceleration of axial movement, disc effect and first order vibration of rotor increased with the increase of the yaw angle. The reason was that yaw exciting force which generated by the yaw behavior increased with the increase of yaw angle. At a constant load yaw, vibration acceleration of <b>axial</b> <b>float,</b> disc effect increased with the increase of the yaw angle. At the yaw condition of constant load R= 82 Ω, R= 118 Ω and the yaw angle 25 °, 30 °,the acceleration value sharp increased and occurred the machine resonance phenomenon due to the tower instability. First order symmetric and anti symmetric vibration acceleration of rotor decreased with the increase of the yaw angle. The reason was that after the wind turbine yaw, the speed decreased of rotor caused the centrifugal force of the blades decreased, the impact of the centrifugal load changed was far greater than yaw exciting force for the first order vibration acceleration. The study also found that vibration acceleration values of rotor first order anti symmetric was greater than axial movement, disc effect and first order symmetric vibration acceleration values, which shows that stress concentration in root of blade was large and the blade fatigue damage was more serious. This paper related research results can provided a new analytical thinking for rotor fatigue damage or breakage occurred frequently in wind turbine operation process, and may provide a reference for the vibration characteristics of rotor in the process of yaw...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach is}} here selected to investigate mixed friction phenomena where testing rigs {{cannot be used}} or need complex adaptations to deliver reliable measurements. The following work focuses on the numerical investigations of mixed friction systems combining fluid-solid and solid-solid interactions at the micro scale. Goal {{is to improve the}} accuracy of future macro models by applying them more precise boundary conditions derived from micro models. A three dimensional model is built in a Finite Elements (FE) software composed of one fluid lubricating two sliding rough surfaces. Both surfaces are generated according to a statistical method making use of measured technical surfaces. To model the interactions between the fluid and the solid structure, the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian remeshing process is used. A model is built, based on an <b>axial</b> <b>floating</b> bearing on which the adhesion effects are the most present. Global friction coefficient between both lubricated solids is established using the FE solver and solid-solid friction can be separated from the fluid-solid friction with further post-processing operations...|$|R
40|$|The <b>axial</b> and radial <b>floating</b> {{potential}} distribution in a modified Penning discharge {{have been studied}} at different values of the background pressure, discharge voltage, and magnetic field. An array of small disc probes arranged radially with their planes perpendicular to the magnetic field and movable along the axial direction was inserted in the plasma through one open end of the magnetic mirror system. Results show that depending on the operating conditions, the discharge can undergo different mode transitions in which the plasma can sustain different floating potentials in the radial {{as well as in}} the axial directions. Preliminary results of measurement, using RF probes in the modified Penning discharge plasma are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{methods of}} {{analysis}} are developed for computing the dynamic steady-state <b>axial</b> response of <b>floating</b> pile groups embedded in homogeneous and non-homogeneous soil deposits. Physically-motivated approximations are introduced {{to account for the}} interaction between two individual piles. It is found that such an interaction arises chiefly from the 'interference' of wave fields originating along each pile shaft and spreading outward. For homogeneous deposits the wave fronts originating at an individual pile are cylindrical and the interaction is essentially independent of pile flexibility and slenderness. For non-homogeneous deposits the wave fronts are non-cylindrical and ray-theory approximations are invoked to derive pile flexibility-dependent interaction functions. Results are presented for the dynamic stiffness and damping of several pile groups, as well as for distribution of the applied load among individual piles. For deposits with modulus proportional to depth, the agreement with the few rigorous solutions available is encouraging. A comprehensive parameter study focuses on the effects of soil inhomogeneity and pile-group configuration. It is demonstrated that the 'dynamic group efficiency' may far exceed unity at certain frequencies. Increasing soil inhomogeneity tends to reduce the respective resonant peaks and lead to smoother interaction functions, in qualitative agreement with field evidence...|$|R
