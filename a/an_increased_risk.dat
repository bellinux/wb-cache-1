Sexual assault is also believed to carry <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, {{and there may be}} a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of thrombosis. This probably results from a physiological hypercoagulability in pregnancy that protects against postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of cardiovascular disease and some also <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin causes <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of {{cerebral}} microbleeds {{having the}} appearance on MRI scans of 5 to 10mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches. Such cerebral microbleeds are important, since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, Binswanger disease, and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

50|$|In liver cirrhosis, {{there is}} {{decreased}} production of alpha 2-antiplasmin, leading to decreased inactivation of plasmin and <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in fibrinolysis. This {{is associated with}} <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>risk</b> of bleeding in liver disease.|$|R
50|$|Women who use {{combined}} {{oral contraceptive}} pills have <b>a</b> modestly <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of myocardial infarction, {{especially in the}} presence of other risk factors. The use of non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), even for as short as <b>a</b> week, <b>increases</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|R
5|$|Conditions {{and risk}} factors that {{predispose}} to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. The use of acid-suppressing medications—such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers—is associated with <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of pneumonia. The risk is also increased in old age.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, malaria causes anemia {{during a}} period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage {{resulting}} from cerebral malaria. Some survivors of cerebral malaria have <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E
5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including atrial fibrillation and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E

50|$|Women with factor V Leiden have <b>a</b> {{substantially}} <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of clotting {{in pregnancy}} (and on estrogen-containing {{birth control pills}} or hormone replacement) {{in the form of}} deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. They also may have <b>a</b> small <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of preeclampsia, may have <b>a</b> small <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of low birth weight babies, may have <b>a</b> small <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of miscarriage and stillbirth due to either clotting in the placenta, umbilical cord, or the fetus (fetal clotting may depend on whether the baby has inherited the gene) or influences the clotting system may have on placental development. Note that many of these women go through one or more pregnancies with no difficulties, while others may repeatedly have pregnancy complications, and still others may develop clots within weeks of becoming pregnant.|$|R
5|$|Long-term use of benzodiazepines {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased risk of cognitive impairment, but its relationship with dementia remains inconclusive. The association of a past history of benzodiazepine use and cognitive decline is unclear, with some studies reporting a lower risk of cognitive decline in former users, some finding no association and some indicating <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of cognitive decline.|$|E
5|$|Marijuana smoke {{contains}} {{many of the}} same carcinogens as those in tobacco smoke. However, the effect of smoking cannabis on lung cancer risk is not clear. A 2013 review did not find <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> from light to moderate use. A 2014 review found that smoking cannabis doubled the risk of lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, but this has been poorly studied and is associated with <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E
50|$|COX-2 inhibitors {{have been}} found to <b>increase</b> the <b>risk</b> of atherothrombosis even with {{short-term}} use. A 2006 analysis of 138 randomised trials and almost 150 000 participants showed that selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with <b>a</b> moderately <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of vascular events, mainly due to <b>a</b> twofold <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of myocardial infarction, and also that high-dose regimens of some traditional NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen, but not naproxen) are associated with <b>a</b> similar <b>increase</b> in <b>risk</b> of vascular events.|$|R

5|$|Phenformin, another biguanide, was {{withdrawn}} from the market because of <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years).

5|$|Protein C {{deficiency}} {{may cause}} purpura fulminans, a severe clotting disorder in the newborn {{that leads to}} both tissue death and bleeding into the skin and other organs.

50|$|In recent 2015 study, {{copy number}} {{variation}} of PRR30 gene {{was linked to}} <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>risk</b> for neurofibromatosis. 78% of the patients displaying type 1-associated cutaneous neurofibromas carried an extra copy of the PRR30 gene. No mechanism was described illuminating the correlation.|$|R
5|$|Since 2008, {{consensus}} American and British opinion {{has been}} that in general people with TSH under 10mIU/l do not require treatment.

5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and spinach) are not associated with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk,</b> with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer and spirits.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{abnormalities}} {{severe enough}} to warrant treatment have <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of death reported to be 23% over 18 months and 46% over 50 months.
