40|$|The root {{architecture}} of higher plants is amazingly diverse. In this review, we compare the lateral root developmental programme <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> and Arabidopsis thaliana. <b>In</b> <b>cereals,</b> cells <b>in</b> the endodermis are recruited {{to form the}} new root cap and overlying cortical cells divide to facilitate {{the emergence of the}} lateral root primordium. The TIR 1 /ABF 2 auxin receptors and the AUX/IAA, ARF, and LBD transcriptional regulatory proteins are conserved <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> and Arabidopsis. Several elements of this regulatory network are common to lateral and crown roots <b>in</b> <b>cereals.</b> Also, the ground meristem from which crown roots differentiate shows similarities with the root pericycle. Studies <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> promise to give complementary insights into the mechanisms regulating the development of post-embryonic roots in plants...|$|R

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} <b>in</b> <b>cereal</b> processing {{a couple}} of decades ago, the knowledge on xylanases and their functionality <b>in</b> <b>cereal</b> based processes has significantly improved. It has since then become convincingly clear that both limited as well as extensive modification of the fairly low levels of arabinoxylan <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> by these enzymes can induce large changes in processing and final product quality. Of more recent date is the understanding that such modifications equally alter the nutritional properties of this dietary fibre fraction. After a short introduction on xylanases <b>in</b> <b>cereal</b> processing <b>in</b> general, this presentation will focus on two cases to demonstrate their possible technological as well as nutritional impact. While the first case deals with the problem of dough syruping in refrigerated dough caused by elevated levels of endogenous xylanases, the second case deals with the in situ production of prebiotic arabinoxylan oligosaccharides in whole wheat bread, from concept to clinical trial. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Factors that {{determine}} the digestibility of carbohydrates and minerals <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> are examined. Most carbohydrates and minerals <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> are structurally bound, either surrounded by or associated with cell wall components not easily digested by non-ruminant animals and humans. Treatments such as mechanical grinding and heat improve the digestibility of nutrient s. Further processing and cooking result in structural and physeochemical changes of cereal starch, phytate, and dietary fiber. Such changes greatly Influence the physiological and metabolic effects in animals and humans. The digestive breakdown of most nutrient components is also {{dependent on the}} activities of enzymes <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> and <b>in</b> the mammalian digestive system. However, starch, phytate, and dietary fiber are not entirely and readily degraded by enzymes. Undegraded components reduce both the caloric value {{of the food and}} the availabilities of other nutrients by interacting with them in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies on avallabil Hies of carbohydrates and minerals <b>in</b> <b>cereal</b> foods are conducted in humans and rats or under in vitro conditions, using various analytical methods Including microscopy. The advantage of applying light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis to study the digestive breakdown of structural components <b>in</b> <b>cereal</b> foods is highlighted by demonstrating the capabilities of the techniques to reveal both structural and microchemical information...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Seed-borne {{diseases}} are increasingly becoming important in organic farming, therefore effective seed treatment methods are urgently needed. Physical methods have efficacy against {{a number of}} seed-borne pathogens, but may have adverse effects if applied at too high intensity. Thermal treatment in water has the widest application. To control the loose smuts of wheat and barley {{it is still the}} only available non-chemical sanitation method. Other physical treatment methods with practical relevance <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> are hot humid air and electron treatment. Hot water treatment is also known to control different seed-borne pathogens of vegetables. Various preparations of microorganisms, plant extracts and other agents of natural origin have been and are still being tested <b>in</b> <b>cereals</b> and vegetables. <b>In</b> <b>cereals,</b> some of them are already applied commercially. ...|$|R
