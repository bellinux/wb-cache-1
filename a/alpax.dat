50|$|The Sensaud de Lavaud was a French {{automobile}} manufactured between 1926 and 1928. An unusual car, made in Paris by M. Dimitri Sensaud de Lavaud, a Brazilian, it had {{an automatic}} transmission. The <b>Alpax</b> chassis was cast alloy, and it was powered by a steam-cooled 5475 cc six-cylinder engine of American origin. Few were built.|$|E
50|$|The Compound B38, made {{extensive}} use of <b>Alpax,</b> an aluminium alloy, to make castings that were assembled into a frame onto which steel sheet metal pressings were bolted and welded. In this respect the car played a pioneering role in light metal technologies that would be taken on by the automotive and airplane industries, although {{the rising cost of}} aluminium would reduce its attractions as a mainstream element in car bodies in the later 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Bionier and Delagarde {{developed}} a new car called the VP2 that substituted a chassis of two tall narrow steel box members and cross-bracing for the AFG's <b>Alpax</b> unitary unit. The VP2 was a 4-door 4-seat car. The bodywork was still of aluminum and reflected the styling of the AFG, although neither Grégoire nor Bionier were entirely satisfied with it. Panhard may have been pressured to make the VP2 look like the AFG but they never acknowledged any {{connection between the two}} cars. Grégoire eventually sued Panhard for unpaid royalties. The VP2 went into production as the Panhard Dyna X.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time {{automotive}} innovator Jean-Albert Grégoire {{was working on a}} car originally called the [...] "Automobile Légère Grégoire" [...] (ALG) later renamed [...] "Aluminium Français Grégoire" [...] (AFG) when the French national aluminum consortium stepped in to sponsor the project. The resulting prototype was also a small front-wheel drive car powered by an air-cooled two-cylinder boxer engine. The AFG weighed only 400kg due to the use of <b>Alpax</b> to produce a unitary-style chassis and the use of aluminum for the bodywork. Grégoire showed the car to several French car makers including Simca but none showed interest.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1928 a {{sensation}} at the 22nd Paris Motor Show was the Bucciali TAV-6. [...] Six {{years before the}} appearance of the Citroën Traction and more than two years before the launch of the DKW F1, the Bucciali TAV-6 featured front-wheel drive. [...] Another innovative concept which would only become familiar to most auto-industry observers several decades later was provided by the Sensaud de Lavaud infinitely variable automatic transmission. [...] The car was exhibited on the Bucciali show stand in bare chassis form, enabling visitors to study the fwd drive-train with its enormous transversely mounted transmission, as well as the all-round independent suspension. [...] Almost as eye catching in their own terms were the wheels which were elaborately sculpted from <b>Alpax</b> castings. [...] The car at the show sat on a 3470 mm wheelbase and was powered by a Continental side-valve 2.4 litre engine. [...] Later versions of the car would be offered with 6 or 8 cylinder engines.|$|E
5000|$|J [...]A. Grégoire {{designed}} an 11cv 6-cylinder car for Donnet in 1932. Only four prototypes were produced, {{one being}} {{shown at the}} Paris Salon of 1932 before Donnet went into liquidation. He then worked with Lucian Chenard to design two cars for Chenard et Walcker. They were of advanced design but were not a commercial success. In 1937 he designed the Amilcar Compound, produced by Hotchkiss from 1938 to the Second World War, by which time 681 examples had been made. It was constructed using another of Grégoire's ideas, a cast <b>Alpax</b> (light alloy) chassis frame. Other advanced features were {{rack and pinion steering}} and all independent suspension. But the car had its bad points, cable brakes and gear-change linkage and a side-valve engine although the latter was still common at this time. An overhead valve version came later. During the Second World War he secretly worked with his design team at his works at Asnières-sur-Seine on a small car the Aluminium [...] "Francais-Gregoire". It had a chassis-body frame of light alloy, front-wheel drive, an air-cooled flat twin engine and independent suspension on all wheels. A four-seat car weighing only 880 lb and could reach 60 mi/h km/h while returning 70 mpg. This design was to form the basis of the 1950 [...] "Dyna" [...] Panhard. In 1950 another Hotchkiss car the [...] "Hotchkiss-Gregoire", was produced again with an alloy chassis and body. With independent suspension on all four wheels and fitted with a water-cooled flat four engine of 2 litres, ahead of the front axle, it was fast, with a top speed of 94 mi/h km/h, but the car was expensive and only 250 examples were made by 1954. In 1956 Grégoire produced a two-seat convertible with a 2.2-litre supercharged flat-four engine producing [...] and, {{as in the case of}} the cars mentioned previously, front-wheel drive. All ten cars made were fitted with bodies designed and built by Henri Chapron.|$|E
