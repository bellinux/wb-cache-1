50|$|In France, the {{tradition}} of <b>anonymous</b> <b>births</b> {{can be traced to}} 1638 when Vincent de Paul who instituted the tour, a form of baby hatch. During the French Revolution <b>anonymous</b> <b>births</b> were legalized in 1793, when Article 326 of the Code Civil introduced both the concepts of <b>anonymous</b> and confidential <b>births.</b> The decree provided for the creation of safe spaces for women to give birth safely. In 1811 the assistance was replaced with a system of baby hatches. This however caused a surge in abandoned babies and was never fully implemented and officially abolished in 1904. Since that time all hospitals must provide wards where women can give birth anonymously. In 2002 a 'national council for access to personal origins' (CNAOP) is created to mediate between the anonymous mothers and children. The birth mother is asked to leave information about their identity behind in a sealed envelope that can be opened by the CNAOP if the child ever asks so that the birth mother can be contacted. However, the information will not be given to the child without consent.|$|R

40|$|The work {{follows the}} current {{legislation}} dealing with matters of parenthood. It is designed {{in accordance with}} the breakdown of motherhood and fatherhood. After an introduction, defining the purpose and need for legal regulation of family issues, follow the main chapters dealing with different issues. First, attention is paid to the determination of motherhood. This section is divided into three chapters, the first of which is further divided for clarity even in the following sections. The first chapter is devoted to the issue of child identity undetected. This chapter is further divided into parts and special sections devoted to the identity of unidentified child, called the found child, another sub-chapter describes the legislation and the possibility of using the birth mother's identity and privacy of <b>anonymous</b> <b>births,</b> and the last sub-sections deal with the problem of their baby boxes, and legal issues. In other chapters of the work deals with the erroneous entry in the matrix and the state where the child is born outside the medical facility.

50|$|An <b>anonymous</b> <b>birth</b> is a birth {{where the}} mother {{gives birth to}} a child without {{disclosing}} her identity, or where her identity remains unregistered.

50|$|In an <b>anonymous</b> <b>birth,</b> the mother's {{right of}} informational {{self-determination}} severely curtails the children's {{right to know}} about their biological ancestry, therefore going beyond {{the concept of a}} confidential birth, where the identity of the mother is registered but remains undisclosed, unless the grown up child requests disclosure at a later point.|$|E

40|$|The Abstract The aim of {{my thesis}} {{is to find}} and {{describe}} the problematic aspects of the determination of parenthood. I chose four areas of the determination of parenthood, {{which can lead to}} various complications - assisted reproduction, surrogacy, secret childbirths and <b>anonymous</b> <b>births.</b> In the first chapter of the thesis I deal with the legal aspects of the determination of parenthood. I examine mandatory determination of maternity and various assumptions of paternity. With the development of relations in the society and of the reproductive medicine, there emerge possibilities doubting the traditional legal principles of the determination of parenthood. Mother is not always certain anymore and there are five presumptions of paternity in the Czech legal order nowadays, compared to the traditional three. The second chapter is devoted to the issue of assisted reproduction. Assisted reproduction is a modern and rapidly developing area of medicine that allows infertile couples to have their own child. It is a medical specialty that requires a broad legal framework to prevent its abuse. At the end of a successful medical procedure a new life is coming into existence and such area must be regulated. The third chapter, entitled Surrogacy, builds on the previous chapter. Surrogacy is often discussed area of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{development}} of particular law fields related to the parenthood and to assess how the case law of the European Court of Human Rights influences interpretation of term parenthood, legal regulation thereof as well as practical realization of certain {{issues related to the}} parenthood. The thesis focuses especially on development of interpretation of term "family" and "parenthood", determination of parenthood, right to be a parent, right not to become a parent and right of children to know their genetic origin while a special attention is paid to controversial issues such as surrogacy, baby-boxes, assisted reproduction, abortions or secret and <b>anonymous</b> <b>births.</b> In case of all topics is cited, together with the relevant domestic case law, as well case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the thesis analyzes whether and to which extent they do correspond with each other and how the views of the European Court of Human Rights are reflected in the domestic law. Further, the thesis suggests how the Czech legal regulation could be modified in the future thanks to the influence of the European Court of Human Rights. The last part of the thesis deals with case law study and demonstrates how the Czech legal order has been modified in the past due to case law of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Determination of Parenthood The {{topic of}} my thesis is Determination of Parenthood. With this topic are {{connected}} problems not only legal, but often also social and ethical. Parenthood affects {{all of us}} and it's an important aspect of human life. That's why there should be legal assurance in relationship between parent and child. Development in the field of medicine is still ahead (mainly thanks to methods of assisted reproduction and DNA analysis) and the rules of law should respond and deal with it. The aim of this thesis is describe and become acquainted with problematics of determination of parenthood, valorize how legislation responds to modern development and to propose possible changes. Thesis is prepared on the basis of existing legislation on the date of submission of the thesis. Thesis is divided into seven main chapters, which are divided to further subsections. First chapter deals with concept of parenthood and methods of determination. Second chapter describes historical development of legislation on Czech territory, since Roman law to recodification of civil law. Related third chapter concisely summarizes national and international legal sources of current legislation. Chapter four is about determination of maternity and problems of surrogacy, <b>anonymous</b> childbirth, concealed <b>birth</b> [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{confidential}} birth, the mother's right of informational self-determination suspends the children's {{right to know}} about their biological ancestry until she changes her mind or until the grown up child requests disclosure at a later point.

50|$|In contrast, {{other jurisdictions}} (particularly western {{continental}} European countries) tend to favour social parentage over the biological parentage. Here a man (not necessarily the biological father) may voluntarily recognise {{the child to}} be identified as the father, thus giving legitimacy to the child; the biological father does not have any special rights in this area.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{parentage}} determination. At present, {{this issue is}} becoming more and more topical due to current diversion from traditional values, the traditional model of family in particular. The thesis concerns not only with the determination of paternity, but also with maternity determination, which is mentioned with regard to assisted reproduction and surrogacy. Emphasis is placed on both, current legislation and the new Civil Code coming into effect on 1 January 2014. The thesis is divided into eight chapters. The introduction discusses possible views on the concept of parenthood. Furthermore, it introduces the issue of parentage determination, especially in connection with the increasing number of children born outside marriage. The following chapter is devoted to legislative regulation of parentage determination itself. Firstly, it elaborates the history of such regulations with focus on Roman law and the Austrian Civil Code. Subsequently, it describes the current legislation and briefly comments on the new Civil Code, which is further discussed in the corresponding chapters. The third chapter examines the determination of maternity. Included are the issues of assisted reproduction and surrogacy, as well as <b>anonymous</b> and concealed <b>births,</b> which have become an important topic rather recently [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|South Australia will be {{the first}} Australian state to {{introduce}} legislation to remove children born to parents convicted of manslaughter or murder and place them under the custody of the relevant minister, the SA government announced recently. SA Coroner Mark Johns made the initial recommendation after investigating the many years of abuse and eventual death of four-year-old Chloe Valentine. Chloe was injured and died in 2012 after her mother and mother’s partner repeatedly put the girl on a 50 -kilogram bike and filmed her crashing into objects. Across Australia, 34 children were the victims of filicide – the killing of a child by a parent – in the two years leading up to 2012. In a well-coordinated and well-resourced child protection system, health staff, child protection workers and forensic specialists should already be collaborating to share information about children and families at risk of harm. These teams should be responding to the warnings some parents give prior to committing these crimes, then deciding whether parents convicted of murdering their children should have subsequent offspring removed. However, responses to high-risk pregnancy and high-risk infants across Australia could be described as haphazard, and legislation alone will not correct the problem. Uncharted territory South Australia’s move is not without precedent. New Zealand gave the court responsibility for the safety of subsequent children born to parents convicted of murder or manslaughter in 2013. However there is no publicly accessible data on the rate of removal and no evaluations to date. Importantly, the New Zealand legislation has some flexibility to work with parents convicted of murder or manslaughter, but the onus is on the parent to demonstrate they are safe to parent subsequent children. We have strong research detailing the demographics of parents who kill children and other contributing factors, such as psychotic depression, parental separation, retribution for leaving a relationship, domestic violence, fatal maltreatment, substance use and so on. Researchers have also made a number of suggestions about {{what can be done to}} prevent filicide aside from removing children, such as treating mental illness and introducing safe havens for <b>anonymous</b> <b>birthing.</b> But there has been no evaluation of what works and what doesn’t. The ethics of designing a research project that compares treatments, interventions or approaches to protect subsequent children of those who commit filicide over time is an understandable barrier. Logistical barriers While the intent of the South Australian legislation to prevent harm is noble, it doesn’t address the barriers that currently exist in the child protection system. First, the plan assumes we know who has been convicted of the manslaughter or murder of their child. The judicial and law enforcement sector knows who these people are. However, other agencies with crucial involvement in child protection only know if they are told by law enforcement. The law enforcement sector cannot be responsible for actively tracking the reproductive activity of those convicted of the manslaughter or murder of children for the term of convicted person’s life. Removal “at birth” also implies that the health department has been informed of the previous conviction, that the child protection agency knows the woman is pregnant and that they know where the woman will give birth. By linking the removal “at birth”, the focus is on the woman and does not account for the paternity of the child. It’s unclear how this approach will include males previously convicted who may or may not be identified as the biological father of the unborn/newborn or current partner of the pregnant woman. Responding to high-risk pregnancies Child protection authorities were first notified about Chloe Valentine during her mother’s pregnancy. According to the Coroner, a report to the Child Abuse Report Line described Chloe’s mother as “dirty”, “smelly”, “unhygienic”, “taking drugs and drinking”, and “not obtaining proper antenatal medical treatment”. It is not uncommon for child welfare risks to emerge during pregnancy. Indicators of possible future harm to the child include suicide risk, serious and persistent substance use, being a victim of domestic violence, homelessness and inadequate preparations for birth. Child protection legislation, risk studies and structured decision-making tools are commonly employed in child protection situations to assess and respond to risk. One of the key planks in the platform to monitor pregnant women at risk of domestic violence, unmanaged mental illness and substance use, is the unborn child high risk birth alert operating in some jurisdictions. Some states have legislation to support the prenatal reporting of children at risk. In states or territories where there is no law specifically relating to unborn child information exchange, inter-agency collaboration protocols allow agencies to share information about unborn children. These policy responses are aimed at redressing the risks giving rise to the prenatal report, prior to the child’s birth; in other words, getting to the cause of maltreatment and working on those risks. But the patchwork of responses states and territories have to high-risk pregnancy and high-risk infants is problematic. There is also a risk that pregnant women under surveillance will avoid contact with services, such as avoiding antenatal care, deny they are pregnant, move to other jurisdictions to give birth, not register the child’s birth, and so on. Systems that seem to work best are integrated, supported by cross-agency policy and strive for active engagement with service users. Wrap-around intersecting interagency responses must be coordinated, backed by the legal sharing of child protection information. Systems that don’t work well are fragmented, typified by lack of collaboration and communication. Structural issues such as conflicting service mandates, under-resourcing and difference in practice frameworks can result in services being provided in silos to at-risk families, rather than in cooperation. This complex area requires a sophisticated response. There may be pockets where programs are operating well, but there is no systematic approach across the country, or even state-wide. Any risk-management system in child protection needs multilateral agency participation to ensure such a system delivers on what it is trying to do: protect subsequent children. • Rosemaria Flaherty, PhD candidate, Australian Centre for Child Protection, University of South Australia and Fiona Arney, Chair and Director, Australian Centre for Child Protection, University of South Australia This article was originally published on The Conversation.

50|$|In 2003 the European Court of Human Rights {{ruled in}} a case {{involving}} <b>anonymous</b> <b>birth</b> in Odievre v. France. The applicant's mother had given birth anonymously and when the applicant later asked for more information she was only given non-identifying information. The applicant appealed to the Court citing article 8 of the ECHR stating {{that it was a}} violation to the right to a family life. The Court noted that the case could not simply be viewed as a conflict between the rights of the birth mother and the child, but also affected the rights of the adoptive parents and any family of the birth mother. The Court ruled that, given that the recently created National Council on Access to Information about Personal Origins presented avenue to contact the birth mother in a controlled way, that the state had attempted to strike a sufficient balance between the competing right and the application was denied.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of biology and medicine enables that legal and biological maternity and paternity coincide completely, owing to biomedical analysis, {{in particular to}} DNA analysis. On the other hand, {{development of}} biology and medicine causes discrepancy in legal and biological maternity and paternity in the situation of biomedically assisted conception if donor genetic material is used.

It could be said that the autonomy of the parties is limited by the requirement that maternity and paternity in such cases be established based on the biological facts...|$|E
40|$|It is {{impossible}} to know the number of infants killed or illegally abandoned at birth. No official reporting requirements exist, but conservative estimates claim that in the United States, 150 - 300 infants are killed within twenty-four hours of life and that over 100 infants are illegally abandoned. Beginning in 1999, in an effort to stem the problem of neonaticide and illegal abandonment, states began enacting laws to legalize abandonment. By 2008, all fifty states had enacted safe haven laws, which allow parents to anonymously abandon newborns by delivering them to designated providers, such as hospitals. This article provides a practical and theoretical framework to discuss safe haven laws, which have come under attack by various adoption groups and legal scholars who claim the laws are ineffective. This article demonstrates that those unjustified attacks fail to recognize that increased usage of safe haven laws in states with strong public awareness programs has effectively reduced the number of infant deaths in those states. Additionally, this article contrasts American safe haven laws with models in other countries, including <b>anonymous</b> <b>birth</b> in France and baby flaps in Germany. Finally, this article considers the rhetoric of legalized abandonment and suggests that the rhetoric of kairos, or right-timing, offers a pragmatic and feminist lens through which to view safe havens as one effective option for women facing the crisis of unwanted pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between women's rights and children's rights {{is strong and}} complex. Their rights and interests are often assumed to coincide, but in practice {{that is not necessarily}} the case. Granting rights to children may be to the benefit of women. However, appeals to the rights and best interests of children may also have the effect of curtailing women's rights. Feminists, therefore, have always eyed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child with some suspicion and ambiguity. In 1993 states, convened in Vienna for the World Conference on Human Rights, decided that the human rights treaty bodies had to integrate the human rights of women. For the Children's Rights Committee this meant that it had to take the differing positions of boys and girls into account when formulating its recommendations to States parties to the Convention. Two years later, at the occasion of the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the United Nations agreed to mainstream a genderperspective into all their acitvities in order to speed up the advancement of the position of women. For the Children's Rights Committee this implied an extension of its task. Since 1995 the Committee must consider any possible gender bias that may result from its recommendations, including effects on the position of mothers and fathers. This study contains a gender analysis of the work of the Children's Rights Committee as it influences the position of parents. Three themes in the Committee's work have been analysed: the right to identity and filiation law, the right to be cared for and the sex-based division of roles, and the right to life and survival in combination with reproductive rights. The indicators chosen for the analysis were (legal) sex equality, empowerment of women, and transformation. Employment of these three indicators provides a clear picture {{of the extent to which}} gender has been mainstreamed in the work of the Children's Rights Committee. A myriad of issues are dealt with, ranging from the right to nationality, day-care centres, co-parenting, <b>anonymous</b> <b>birth,</b> interactive play with toddlers, teenage and solo-motherhood, breastfeeding, and maternal and child mortality to abortion and social security benefits. The analysis shows that the number of recommendations that may benefit women is impressive. However, gender mainstreaming is a complicated and gigantic endeavor, and it is not surprising that much more can and should be done. In particular, the value attached by the Committee to the involvement of a father figure, should be modified. To 'add fathers and stir' is not always the only or best solution for the problem at hand. A less normative standard that focuses on the quality rather than the form of family life will benefit children as well as their mothers and women more generally...|$|E
