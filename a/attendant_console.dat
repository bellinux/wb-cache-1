5000|$|The <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> {{provides}} {{control for}} many call management features and answers and routes incoming calls. A common {{example for the}} use of an <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|In April 2007, TalkSwitch {{introduced}} its <b>Attendant</b> <b>Console</b> application, the first software application built to augment its line of phone systems. The <b>Attendant</b> <b>Console</b> {{allows users to}} monitor and manage calls directly from their PCs, without requiring any additional hardware.|$|E
5000|$|In larger PBXs the <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> {{may also}} be used to perform certain {{administrative}} tasks. Smaller systems may have all programming of the phone system done from the <b>attendant</b> <b>console.</b> As the attendant typically knows more about the phone system than other users, the <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> may be used to alert users to a problem with the phone system. As an example should a Definity ECS PBX have a problem, such as a hardware failure, it may activate an alarm light on the console so the attendant can call for repair.|$|E
25|$|XLR-8 got a Secondary Control Panel in July 1988. This {{panel was}} {{located on the}} loading side of the queue house and near the first row loading position. The ride <b>attendant</b> and Master <b>Console</b> Operator had to hold their {{dispatch}} buttons simultaneously in order to dispatch a train. This alteration was made in order to enforce a double check between ride attendants and operators.|$|R
50|$|An <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> is a {{telephone}} station that is generally {{part of a}} private branch exchange (PBX) or Centrex or other private telephone system. An <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> generally is a regular PBX telephone station {{with one or more}} additional modules each bearing numerous buttons that can be programmed to be associated with particular lines in the private telephone system, or with particular specialized functions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attendant}} {{checks the}} status of the called party's line by looking at the appropriate button on the <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> and either: ...|$|E
5000|$|In telephony, a Switched loop is {{a circuit}} that {{automatically}} releases a connection from an <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> or switchboard, once the connection {{has been made}} to the appropriate terminal.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> {{may also}} be sent other calls that the PBX may not {{otherwise}} know how to handle, such as direct inward dialed calls that are not associated with a valid extension. The <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> typically has no restrictions about the types of calls that may be made from it so the attendant may complete calls for restricted extensions. This is typically the case where a phone is placed in a public location, such as a lobby, but is set up so that it cannot dial long distance or international calls. Callers using the public phone must dial the attendant, who can complete the call for them.|$|E
50|$|Selsius {{designed}} an IP PBX system {{consisting of}} a line of IP phones, a server-based call control application - the Selsius-CallManager, a line of voice over IP gateways and voice applications including voicemail, an automated <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> and a softphone.|$|E
50|$|A call {{transfer}} is a telecommunications mechanism that enables a user to relocate an existing telephone call to another phone or <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> using a transfer button or a switchhook flash and dialing the required location. The transferred call is either announced or unannounced.|$|E
50|$|Trunk {{groups may}} also be {{assigned}} a button with an indicator light so the attendant can monitor their use. If {{nearly all of the}} trunks in a trunk group are in use, the light illuminates. The attendant may push the button forcing all calls that would normally use the trunk to be routed to the <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> thus allowing the attendant to decide how to ration the remaining free trunks.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft Lync is {{the primary}} client {{application}} released with Lync Server. This client is used for IM, presence, voice and video calls, desktop sharing, file transfer and ad hoc conferences. With Lync 2013 {{there will be a}} release of Lync Light Client with fewer features.Microsoft also ships the Microsoft <b>Attendant</b> <b>Console.</b> This is a version of the Lync more oriented towards receptionists or delegates / secretaries or others who get a large volume of inbound calls.|$|E
5000|$|In {{land-line}} telephony, AIOD leads are Terminal equipment leads used {{solely to}} transmit automatic identified outward dialing (AIOD) {{data from a}} PBX to the {{public switched telephone network}} or to switched service networks (e.g., EPSCS), so that a vendor can provide a detailed monthly bill identifying long distance calling usage by individual PBX stations, tie trunks, or the <b>attendant</b> <b>console.</b> [...] It resembles common channel signalling in that the AIOD leads provide data for all trunks, but is used only for billing, thus resembling automatic number identification.|$|E
50|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{automatic telephone}} exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, gradually replaced manual switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world. In 1919, the Bell System in the United States also adopted automatic switching as its future technology, {{after years of}} reliance on manual systems. Nevertheless, many manual branch exchanges remained operational into {{the second half of}} the 20th century in many enterprises. Later electronic devices and computer technology gave the operator access to an abundance of features. A private branch exchange (PBX) in a business usually has an <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> for the operator, or an auto-attendant, which bypasses the operator entirely.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of Internet {{telephony}} (Voice over IP) technologies, PBX development has tended toward the IP PBX, which uses the Internet Protocol to carry calls. Most modern PBXs support VoIP. ISDN PBX systems also replaced some traditional PBXs in the 1990s, as ISDN offers features such as conference calling, call forwarding, and programmable caller ID. As of 2015 ISDN is being phased out by most major telecommunication carriers throughout Europe in favour of all-IP networks, with some expecting complete migration by 2025 Originally having started as an organization's manual switchboard or <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> operated by a telephone operator or just simply the operator, PBXs have evolved into VoIP centers that are hosted by the operators or even manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operator}} or [...] "attendant" [...] had a {{large and}} complex <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> replacing the old, larger and even more complex switchboard and giving additional control of a connection. Its buttons and lights needed approximately fifty pairs of wires. Incoming calls arrived on an Attendant Trunk which, for customers {{with more than one}} console, waited for one to become idle and then connected to it, initially via Step by Step switches arranged as a Trunk Finder and Position Finder making up a small Automatic call distributor some years before that term was invented. Customers who preferred the old cord switchboards could use an adapted [...] "608" [...] board. In either case the console communicated with the incoming trunk with coded plus and minus 130 VDC signals on Tip, Ring or both wires.|$|E
50|$|Bell Labs {{took over}} Centrex {{development}} in the late 1960s. The NYTel version was designated Centrex I, and the Bell Labs revision Centrex II with additional features. The unreliable Step switches were replaced by a Centrex Position Link Circuit (CXPL), a small, dedicated two stage crossbar network. In the early 1970s Centrex III arrived, a complete redesign bringing more versatility to the old 5XB system. Rather than incoming trunks having appearances on the ordinary Line Link Frame for transfer purposes, Centrex III (or Phase 3 Centrex) had a separate four stage Transfer Network of six-wire crossbar switches to connect to a Transfer Trunk. CXPL continued in use for connecting to consoles. Among other changes, the Phase 3 consoles used DTMF rather than multifrequency pulsing. The Centrex product line was also extended down-market, with Centrex Small Business for customers having mere dozens of lines and no <b>attendant</b> <b>console.</b>|$|E
40|$|Cisco WebAttendant is a {{client-server}} {{application that}} {{enables you to}} set up Cisco IP Phones as attendant consoles. The Cisco WebAttendant client provides a graphical user interface for controlling a Cisco IP Phone as an <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> including speed dial buttons and quick directory access for looking up phone numbers, monitoring line status, and directing calls. Cisco WebAttendant {{can be used by}} a receptionist or administrative assistant to handle calls for a department or company or by an individual. The Cisco WebAttendant client is a plug-in application that is installed on a PC that has IP connectivity to the Cisco CallManager system. The client works in conjunction with a Cisco IP Phone that is registered to a Cisco CallManager (one client for each phone that will be used as an <b>attendant</b> <b>console).</b> Multiple clients can be connected to a single Cisco CallManager. The Cisco Telephony Call Dispatcher (TCD) service running on the Cisco CallManager communicates with Cisco WebAttendant clients for call routing and control, monitors and reports line state, and services client database requests. Administrative tasks such as adding users, configuring pilot points and hunt groups for call routing, and starting and stopping the TCD service are performed 8 - 1 allManager Administration Guide Chapter 8 Understanding Cisco WebAttendant The following table provides an overview of the steps you will need to complete to set up Cisco WebAttendants...|$|E
