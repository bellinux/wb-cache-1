5|$|For {{over seven}} years, Parker worked on making a film {{based on the}} life of Nat Turner. In 2014, he {{announced}} that he had funding and was working on assembling his team, and that the film would be called The Birth of a Nation, in <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> reappropriation of the infamously racist 1915 film of the same name. In addition to writing and directing, Parker cast himself as Turner. Aja Naomi King, Armie Hammer and Gabrielle Union were also cast in key roles.|$|E
5|$|Lady Macbeth {{has gained}} fame along the way. In his 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, Nikolai Leskov updated The Tragedy of Macbeth {{so that it}} takes place among the Imperial Russian {{merchant}} class. In <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> twist, however, Leskov reverses the gender roles – the woman is the murderer and the man is the instigator. Leskov's novel {{was the basis for}} Dmitri Shostakovich's 1936 opera of the same name.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting began local magistrates called on the {{military}} authorities to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him, and to disperse the crowd. Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E

5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E
5|$|This is an {{apparently}} rare example of Western Australian swan symbolism being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only {{an echo of}} its formerly symbolic values. None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> transformation in the symbolism of a bird that that was for so long thought to be non-migratory.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> joke.|$|E

5|$|In the Atlantic, the Allies waged a long {{battle with}} German {{submarines}} which was termed the Battle of the Atlantic. Navy aircraft flew from bases in Greenland and Iceland to hunt submarines, {{and hundreds of}} escort carriers and destroyer escorts were built which were specifically designed to protect merchant convoys. In the Pacific, in <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> twist, the U.S. submarines fought against Japanese shipping in {{a mirror image of}} the Atlantic, with U.S. submarines hunting Japanese merchant ships. At {{the end of the war}} the U.S. had 260 submarines in commission. It had lost 52 submarines during the war, 36 in actions in the Pacific. Submarines effectively destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet by January 1945 and choked off Japan's oil supply.|$|E
5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, {{a tendency to be}} pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} Māori names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or dual English and Māori names or, in a few rare cases, dual Māori names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to capitalise on the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves to the movies.|$|E

5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
5|$|The film {{rights to}} the novel were {{licensed}} in the 1990s, several years after Heinlein's death. The project was originally entitled Bug Hunt at Outpost 9, and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to Starship Troopers. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who found the book too boring to read, and released in 1997. The screenplay, by Ed Neumeier, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military that is completely integrated with respect to gender. It had the stated intention of treating its material in <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> or sarcastic manner, in order to undermine the political ideology of the novel. The mechanized suits that featured prominently in the novel were absent from the film, due to budget constraints.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> {{point of}} view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known hominin ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in <b>an</b> <b>ironic</b> twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
