At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy makes a toast to Robert in order to get his fellow employees to toast him, as if to show to his parents and California that he is valued by his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead more people toast Robert. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing [...] "More Than Words" [...] as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Upset, Andy takes his guitar and storms off.

2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>cheeseburger</b> is a {{hamburger}} with cheese added to it. Traditionally the cheese {{is placed on}} top of the patty, but the burger can include many variations in structure, ingredients, and composition. The term itself is a portmanteau of the words [...] "cheese" [...] and [...] "hamburger." [...] The cheese is usually sliced, and then added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before the patty finishes cooking which allows the cheese to melt. Lionel C. Sternberger is believed to have invented the [...] "cheese hamburger" [...] in the 1920s in the Northeast portion of Los Angeles County. The earliest year attributed to the invention of the cheeseburger by Sternberger is in 1924, while others claimed that he invented it as late as 1926. According to American Heritage, [...] "a local restaurateur was identified as the inventor of the cheeseburger at his death in 1964.

2500|$|As {{with the}} {{invention}} of the hamburger, the exact origins of the cheeseburger are unknown. Several chefs claim to have been the first to add a slice of cheese to a hamburger. Lionel Sternberger of Rite Spot in Pasadena, California takes credit for the cheeseburger, claiming that he invented it between 1924 and 1926. A description from a 1928 menu from the O'Dell Restaurant in Los Angeles reveals that it was serving burgers with slices of cheese at the time. Luis Ballast, owner of the Humpty Dumpty drive-in restaurant in Denver, Colorado, made an attempt to create <b>a</b> <b>cheeseburger</b> with a registered trademark known as a [...] "yellowburger" [...] in 1935. J.C. Reynolds, the operator of a bar in Southern California from 1932 to 1984, popularized a pimento burger. Processed cheese, the type of cheese most used in cheeseburgers, was invented in 1911 by Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland, although the first U.S. patent awarded for it was given to James L. Kraft in 1916. Kraft Foods went on to create the first commercial version of sliced processed cheese, which was first introduced to the market in 1950.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> steamed <b>cheeseburger,</b> also {{referred}} to as a steamer, is <b>a</b> steamed <b>cheeseburger</b> sandwich served by restaurants in central Connecticut. It {{is believed to have been}} invented at a restaurant called [...] "Jack's Lunch" [...] in Middletown, Connecticut in the 1930s. What makes the steamed cheeseburger different from typical cheeseburgers is the way it is prepared. Instead of being fried in a pan or on a grill, it is steamed in a stainless-steel cabinet containing trays that hold either a hamburger patty or a piece of cheese. This method of cooking makes the fats in the meat melt away, resulting in a moist, juicy burger which is then put on a bun and covered with the melted cheese. Various customary toppings can then be added to the burger.|$|R
