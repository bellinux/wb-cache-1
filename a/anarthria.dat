5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or <b>anarthria</b> literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

50|$|Dysarthria is a motor speech {{disorder}} resulting from neurological injury {{of the motor}} component of the motor-speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes.

It is unrelated to problems with understanding language (that is aphasia), although a person can have both. Any of the speech subsystems (respiration, phonation, resonance, prosody, and articulation) can be affected, leading to impairments in intelligibility, audibility, naturalness, and efficiency of vocal communication. Dysarthria that has progressed to a total loss of speech is referred to as <b>anarthria.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two forms}} (also {{referred}} to as [...] "classifications") of FCMS; bilateral and unilateral. The bilateral form is most common (also {{referred to as}} the [...] "classical form") and is caused by the formation of lesions {{on both sides of the}} anterior or posterior region of the operculum. In contrast, the unilateral form is rare and is caused by the formation of lesions on one side of the anterior or posterior region of the operculum. Lesions located in the anterior regions of the operculum are associated with motor deficits and <b>anarthria,</b> a total absence of the ability to form speech or language. Lesions located in the posterior regions of the operculum are associated with parietal opercular functions. The two classifications of FCMS were established based on the location of the lesion, stroke, and trauma affecting the brain. Classifying FCMS based solely upon lesions yields five specific subtypes of FCMS currently known to fall into the bilateral and unilateral categories: ...|$|E

40|$|Cerebellar mutism (<b>anarthria)</b> is a well-described {{complication}} of posterior fossa tumor resection.

We describe two children who presented with a similar clinical finding after nonsurgical cerebellar involvement, hemolytic-uremic syndrome in one and cerebellitis in the other. Postmortem pathologic findings in the first patient indicated cerebellar ischemic necrosis. Single-photon emission computed tomography in the second patient revealed diffuse cerebellar hypoperfusion with no supratentorial abnormalities, refuting a phenomenon of diaschisis between cerebellar and frontal connections. These findings confirm that this clinical syndrome may occur in a nonsurgical, nontraumatic context.

40|$|It {{has often}} been stated that anarthric {{patients}} have scanning speech. The investigation suggests that {{in a number of}} cases this judgment may result from an auditory illusion: the two patients reported although they seem to exhibit scanning speech, in fact do not produce words piecemeal, with intersyllabic pauses. The illusion is caused by syllabic prominence and isochronism, slow articulation rate, frequent pronunciation of the usually silent 'e' and abnormal vowel formation. Of a theoretical total of 572 vowels, one patient made 35 mistakes (6. 1 %), and of a theoretical total of 739 consonants, he made 40 mistakes (5. 4 %). The corresponding percentages for the second patient were 2. 6 % and 13. 7 %. Thus, only the second case conforms to the widely held view that in <b>anarthria</b> vowel production is on the whole less disturbed than consonantal production. Mispronunciations in the two patients were random and unpredictable. The investigation accordingly suggests that in a number of anarthric patients pronunciation is highly variable and largely anarchic. <b>Anarthria</b> thus appears to be a specific linguistic disorder which stands between true aphasia and genuine dysarthria.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{the inevitability}} of disease {{progression}} in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, {{there is a high}} degree of prognostic heterogeneity in all subtypes. Some bulbar-onset (BO) patients may develop rapid <b>anarthria</b> yet remain ambulant for a prolonged period, whereas others progress rapidly, with early generalisation of motor weakness to the limbs and respiratory muscles. Diagnostic delay is a common occurrence in ALS, and many BO patients report having attended other specialist clinics prior to diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study of BO ALS patients seen in a tertiary clinic over a six year period. RESULTS: Forty-nine BO ALS patients were studied. Median survival from symptom onset was 27 months (range 6 - 84). 63 % of subjects were female and the mean age at symptom onset was 68 years. Half had been referred to another speciality prior to diagnosis, either otolaryngology or stroke clinics, but this did not influence diagnostic latency or survival. Emotionality was reported in 45 % of patients. Neurophysiological assessment was performed in 80 %, brain imaging recorded in 69 %, and antibody testing for myasthenia gravis in 22 %. The median time to symptomatic progression beyond the bulbar region was approximately 1 year, with equal proportions progressing to the upper or lower limbs. The median interval from onset to <b>anarthria</b> was 18 months, and to loss of ambulation 22 months. There was a close correlation between the two (r(2) = 0. 6) and median survival from loss of ambulation was only 3 months. Gastrostomy was carried out in 78 % of patients with a median time of 13 months from symptom onset, and 3 months from diagnosis. Median survival from gastrostomy was 10 months. CONCLUSIONS: Survival in bulbar-onset ALS is highly variable. Half of the patients were referred to an inappropriate clinic prior to diagnosis. The time interval to the development of <b>anarthria</b> predicted the timing of subsequent loss of ambulation accurately from which survival may then be only a few months...|$|E
