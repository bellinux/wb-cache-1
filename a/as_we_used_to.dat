In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. Pei {{was inspired by the}} innovative designs of the new International style, characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in , an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: [...] "The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education." [...] Pei was also influenced by the work of US architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1938 he drove to Spring Green, Wisconsin, to visit Wright's famous Taliesin building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.|$|E

Georgia Tech performed one of its accustomed tasks Saturday afternoon, when Clemson was decidedly thrashed, but the task was not performed in the usual manner, for Clemson scored a touchdown. The score was 48 to 7." ...|$|E

That's where the title came from. And then <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> play 7 nights a week, we were battling for material, we'd go for very long jams on that song, {{sometimes}} 20minutes at a time. And during the long outros, I would hear {{and come up with}} different passages, so I would often jot them down and rehearse them and add or take out a bit here and there. Today, I believe that the lyric is about a personal journey, a journey through lifetimes to your soul evolution." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with Reason, Hitchens {{said he had}} been interested in libertarian ideas when he was younger, but set aside those interests in the 1960s. He stated that capitalism had become the more revolutionary economic system, and he welcomed globalisation as [...] "innovative and internationalist", but added, [...] "I don't think that the contradictions, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say, of the system, are by any means all resolved." [...] He also stated that he had a renewed interest in the freedom of the individual from the state, but that he still considered libertarianism [...] "ahistorical" [...] both on the world stage and in the work of creating a stable and functional society, adding that libertarians are [...] "more worried about the over-mighty state than the unaccountable corporation" [...] whereas [...] "the present state of affairs... combines the worst of bureaucracy with the worst of the insurance companies." [...] He also said that libertarians did not have a clear foreign policy stance.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Holder {{spoke of the}} album. [...] "Over {{the last couple of}} years me and Jim have been writing a lot of songs, but we haven't known which way to {{approach}} them really. With Return to Base we were really pleased with the album, we thought that it turned out really well, but it didn't sell. Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> but me and Jim knew that we were, we knew that we were coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E

Mark, 'who have fled.' It is taken from that 20th of Joshua, concerning the man that was to flee to the city of refuge, when the avenger of blood was hard at his heels, to take vengeance on him for the offence he had committed; therefore it is a RUNNING or FLYING for one's life.

40|$|During the Peninsular Wars many napoleonic prisioners were token as captives to France. The non-commissioned officers, {{specially}} military engineers (lieutenants), {{were treated}} as elite prisoners. Then, they had {{a different way of}} life in prison <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> imagine nowadays, even within the academic field, where there is a big gap on the subject. Normally those prisoners could move around the cities they were send and could go to the libraries and universities. So, sometimes the ways they lived that prison period was different as how it was spread in the common mentalities: First, after the conflict (1814); second, within the commemorations (1914), and third, one century later (2012), when it was assumed in the collective mentalities the traumatic experience of the concentration camps and the brutality of world war period (1930 ´s 1950 ´s). So, the image <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> have of that initial moments (1808 - 1814) is quite different to the real one we show in this study...|$|R

60|$|Third. Nothing but the Spirit {{can show}} a man clearly his misery by nature, and so {{put a man}} into a posture of prayer.

O the cursed {{hypocrisy}} that is in most hearts, and that accompanieth many thousands of praying men that would be so looked upon in this day, and all for want of a sense of their misery! But now the Spirit, that will sweetly show the soul its misery, where it is, and what is like to become of it, also the intolerableness of that condition. For it is the Spirit that doth effectually convince of sin and misery, without the Lord Jesus, and so puts the soul into a sweet, sensible, affectionate way of praying to God according to his word (John 16:7-9).|$|R
