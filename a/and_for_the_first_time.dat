The phone came {{in a variety of}} colors, including pink, turquoise, and cream. When one of Mattel's Barbie doll outfits included a Princess phone as an accessory, a fashion trend was born. By 1963, many Baby Boomers had reached driver's license age <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> middle-class families splurged on cars for their offspring.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, {{members of}} Napoleon's {{expedition}} to Egypt (especially Dominique Vivant) drew maps and {{plans of the}} known tombs, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> noted the Western Valley (where Prosper Jollois and Édouard de Villiers du Terrage located the tomb of Amenhotep III, WV22).

In 1971, Pink Floyd took {{second place}} in a reader's poll, in Melody Maker, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex.

5|$|The Interstate grew quickly, {{along with}} the {{automobile}} industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.|$|E

5|$|Bracken {{was elected}} to the Commons in the 1945 general election, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in five years the Tories had their party leader in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives won 67 seats to the Liberals' 125, with smaller parties and independents winning 52 seats. Diefenbaker {{increased}} his majority to over 1,000 votes, and had the satisfaction of seeing Mackenzie King defeated in Prince Albert—but by a CCF candidate. The Prime Minister was returned in an Ontario by-election within months.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed to the British Waterways Board on 1 January 1963, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in over 100 years, it was managed by an {{organisation}} which was not under railway control. The Transport Act 1968 classified all waterways {{under the jurisdiction of}} British Waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. All of the remaining Shropshire Union network was designated as cruising waterway, with the potential for leisure use. By that time there was little commercial traffic. The branch to the River Dee at Chester had been unused since 1932–34, with the demise of steel traffic from Shotton steelworks to Ellesmere Port, and long distance carrying of tar from Ellesmere Port to the Midlands had ended in 1957–58.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s the South Florida {{metropolitan}} area grew {{four times as}} fast {{as the rest of the}} nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6million people moved to south Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas. With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, the Labour group {{resigned}} and the Liberal Democrats took {{office with a}} minority administration. In the 4 June 2009 council elections the Liberal Democrats gained four seats <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> overall control of the city council. In 2010 they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6. In 2011 they lost their majority, leading to a hung council. In the 2013 local elections, in which {{a third of the}} city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7seats and the Green party doubled their seats from 2to 4. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 local {{elections}} the Progress Party regained {{the level of}} support seen at the 1987 elections. This was said largely to have been {{as a result of}} a focus on Progress Party core issues in the electoral campaign, especially immigration, as well as the party dominating the media picture as a result of the controversy around the 1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino. The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a result of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> became the second largest political party in Norway. The 1999 {{local elections}} resulted in the party's first mayor as a direct result of an election, Terje Søviknes in Os. 20 municipalities also elected a deputy mayor from the Progress Party.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans and the Soviets spent {{the spring and}} early summer of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E
5|$|M {{is another}} {{character}} {{who is more}} fully realised {{than in the previous}} novels, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teachers}} at Sabha were Egyptian, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> Gaddafi {{had access to}} pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, most notably the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs. Growing up, Gaddafi witnessed significant events rock the Arab world, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1961. Gaddafi admired the political changes implemented in the Arab Republic of Egypt under his hero, President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser argued for Arab nationalism; the rejection of Western colonialism, neo-colonialism, and Zionism; and a transition from capitalism to socialism. Gaddafi was influenced by Nasser's book, Philosophy of the Revolution, which outlined how to initiate a coup.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November 1859 {{the first}} Olympic Games was held, {{in a city}} square in central Athens.

That stadium, the Panathenaic Stadium, was first used for a modern Olympics Games in 1870 <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> since the ancient Panathenaic and Olympic Games.

Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3million units in its first month, but {{it was less than}} the number of copies, sold in that amount of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels.|$|E
