5|$|During {{his time}} in baseball, Paschal was {{described}} as a five-tool player who excelled <b>at</b> <b>running,</b> throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs, and star Bob Meusel, in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees, and sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League. He {{was one of the best}} pinch hitters in the game during the period, at a time when the term was still relatively new to baseball.|$|E

5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better <b>at</b> <b>running</b> them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E

On October 19 in week 7 of 2014, Robinson made his first start <b>at</b> <b>running</b> back in place of an injured Toby Gerhart. He had an NFL-career-high 127 rushing on 22 carries against the Cleveland Browns to help the 2014 Jacksonville Jaguars end a nine-game losing streak. It was the first 100-yard rushing game for the team for the season and the most rushing yards by a Jaguar in two seasons. He posted career highs in yards and carries and also scored his first NFL touchdown. When Robinson had 108 on 18 carries the {{following}} week against Miami, {{he became the first}} Jaguar to have back-to-back 100-yard games since Maurice Jones-Drew in 2011. On December 7, Robinson endured a foot sprain against the 2014 Houston Texans and he was placed on season-ending injured reserve on December 10.

5|$|The Volunteers' rushing offense {{had been}} led by Aaron Hayden {{during the regular}} season, but Hayden broke his leg during Tennessee's final regular season game. Due to the injury, James Stewart was {{forecast}} to start the game <b>at</b> <b>running</b> back for the Volunteers. During the regular season, Tennessee was ranked No. 13 in rushing, accumulating an average of 231.2 rushing yards per game. Stewart accounted for 93.5 yards of that total, having carried the ball 170 times for 1,028 yards and 11 touchdowns during the regular season. One of Tennessee's other backup running backs, Jay Graham, was predicted to be {{kept out of the}} game due to an injury, but played after undergoing surgery. Graham, who rushed 61 times for 275 yards during the regular season, suffered a broken jaw after being punched in the face by a teammate. Because of the injury to Graham, fourth-string running back Ronnie Pillow, who had carried the ball just five times during the regular season, was predicted to back up Stewart during the game.|$|E
