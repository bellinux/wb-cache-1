5|$|To {{assist in}} {{speeding}} up the ship's construction, the internal hull structure was simplified {{as much as possible}} and an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> standardize on a limited number of standard plates, which varied only in their thickness.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and although an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E
5|$|Little or no <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> recruit African-American {{or other}} women {{minorities}} until October 1944, when President Roosevelt approved of accepting African-American {{women into the}} women's reserve, under pressure {{to do so by}} African-American organizations. Harriet Ida Pickens and Frances Wills were the first African-American women to become WAVE officers. By September 1945, there were 72 African-American women in the WAVES and integrated.|$|E

5|$|Road Runner, Rocky and Bullwinkle, and The Muppets {{have all}} been cited as inspirations for the film. An <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{distance}} the film from Shrek and other similar themed films that had been recently released, by excluding magic, wizards, and fairies from the film.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|An <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{provide the}} {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, {{as well as}} qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.|$|E

50|$|The {{elections}} were marred by riots in Peshtera, where <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> steal the ballot boxes and assault the presiding officer. Violence also occurred in Belogradchik, where <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> prevent the polling station closing until supporters of one candidate had arrived. Voter turnout was low, {{largely due to}} indifference in rural areas where national politics was not considered of importance.|$|R
5|$|An {{internal}} <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> discredit Gomułka's leadership, {{but there}} were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved {{by a combination of}} international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence {{from the}} skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare {{its relationship to}} other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains {{had been removed from}} the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
5|$|On April 6 at 3:15p.m., a third <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> pick Hambleton and now Clark up. Four Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (Sandys 01, 02, 05, and 06) {{prepared}} {{the area around}} the survivors with extensive bombing and strafing. They were assisted by two HH53C helicopters (Jolly Green 67 and Jolly Green 60) from the 37th Air Rescue Squadron. During the day American fighters flew 52 sorties and four B-52 bombers bombed the area around Cam Lo.|$|E

5|$|Scotia left Troon, Scotland, on 2 November 1902. On her way southward {{she called}} at the Irish port of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), at Funchal in Madeira, {{and then the}} Cape Verde Isles before an {{unsuccessful}} <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> land at the tiny, isolated equatorial archipelago known as St Paul's Rocks. This attempt almost cost {{the life of the}} expedition's geologist and medical officer, James Harvie Pirie, who was fortunate to escape from the shark-infested seas after misjudging his leap ashore. Scotia reached Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 6 January 1903, where she re-provisioned for the Antarctic journey ahead.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} of the stage road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, partly due to the massive disturbance of the land during the road's construction. No <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built. In the 1930s, as a relief project during the Great Depression, a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence, by then abandoned for two decades.|$|E
5|$|The 55th Infantry Division {{guarding}} Sedan {{had little}} time for combat training, as its time had been spent in construction work. The division consisted mainly of reservists, most of who were {{over the age of}} 30. Little <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> improve the poor combat quality of the division. One officer, First Lieutenant Delas of the 1st Battalion 147th Fortress Infantry Regiment was arrested and confined for 15 days for ordering firing practice with a 25mm anti-tank gun in a nearby quarry.|$|E

5|$|The Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj {{socio-cultural}} reform movements significantly {{influenced the}} cultural and economic life of Bengal. Between 1905 and 1911 an abortive <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> divide the province of Bengal into two zones. Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943, which claimed 3million lives during World WarII. Bengalis {{played a major role}} in the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when Subhas Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army from Southeast Asia against the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} {{restored}} between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Von Steins were experienced with {{other types of}} museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.|$|E
5|$|A {{battalion}} of the 3rd Parachute Division, {{along with an}} armoured regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division, now joined {{the assault on the}} ridge. At 14:00 the 8th Infantry Battalion on the ridge's northern slopes once more came under attack. Although the infantry and armour closing in on the Polish positions were eventually repulsed, with a large number of prisoners being taken and artillery again causing significant casualties, the Poles were being gradually pushed back. However, they managed to retain their grip on Point 262N and with well-coordinated artillery fire continued to exact a toll on German units traversing the corridor. Another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> organise an attack towards Point 239 but the Germans were ready and the 9th Infantry Battalion's 3rd Company was driven back with heavy losses.|$|E
