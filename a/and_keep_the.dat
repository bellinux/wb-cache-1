5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set {{its first}} {{production}} shipment {{for the games}} in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event {{as an excuse to}} limit shipment <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> demand high.|$|E

5|$|Army Group North {{had already}} {{considered}} abandoning Estonia in February 1944, during the Soviet Kingisepp-Gdov Offensive. A {{large number of}} units would have been freed up with changes to the front, but the Narva front continued to be defended on Hitler's orders. The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland to ease the situation in Finland <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf. The retention of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was important for economic reasons.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the uprights, giving Boston College a 100 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.|$|E

He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E

5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having {{enough money to buy}} release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul.

The Eighth Army, battered by the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> retreating Chinese forces {{from being able to}} rest.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander {{around looking for}} thinner skin such as is found on the ears of mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting {{a hole in the}} host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.|$|E

Sanity Island in order to gather Crystals that will allow Cortex to contain the power of an upcoming planetary alignment <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> planet from being destroyed.

Branković, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who {{was also}} in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, {{expressed}} his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but not against the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians would protect the country <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, {{refused to accept the}} offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was against the war with Venice and did not participate in it.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1745 Jacobite rising {{decimated}} the antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains. This liberalized the Scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> profits instead of giving all profits to the chieftains who owned all the land. Their literate foundation allowed the Scots to become economically literate {{and take advantage of}} trade. Edinburgh and Glasgow became epicenters of intellectual thought. There existed in Scotland a clergy who believed that a moral and religious foundation was required for, and compatible with, a free and open sophisticated culture, which moderated hardline conservatives. Herman presents biographies of Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), Robert Adam, Adam Smith, and others to illustrate the Scottish development.|$|E
