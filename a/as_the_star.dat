5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry.

Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E

5|$|Like many low-mass stars, Gliese 876 is a {{variable}} star. Its variable star designation is IL Aquarii {{and it is}} classified as a BY Draconis variable.

5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two outer CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> radius, the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so {{the size of this}} outer shell would be almost fourteen {{times the size of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Kamiya {{revealed}} {{that he would like}} to have an opportunity to continue PlatinumGames' partnership with Nintendo, creating new properties or working on extending the universe of their existing franchises such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> Fox. Shigeru Miyamoto who produced Star Fox Zero expressed his desire to work with external developers so that the project can have a shorter development cycle. The team was asked to serve as the game's co-developer after Nintendo saw the Arwing stage of Bayonetta 2. Zero, along with its spin-off tower defense game Star Fox Guard, was released in April 2016 to mixed critical reviews. By the end of March 2016, Minami stepped down from his position as president and CEO, with executive producer Kenichi Sato succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Inspector Lomax {{was played}} by Jack Warner, who {{appeared}} by {{arrangement with the}} J. Arthur Rank Organisation, with whom he was contracted. At {{the time he was}} best known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> of Here Come the Huggetts (1948) and its sequels. Shortly after finishing The Quatermass Xperiment, he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with, as the title character in Dixon of Dock Green (1955–76). Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running joke in the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his electric razor.|$|E

5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a contraction of almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if so, what the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> rotates on its axis.|$|E
5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E

Jessica Jones introduces Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones and Mike Colter as Luke Cage, with the latter also headlining Luke Cage. Finn Jones stars as Danny Rand / Iron Fist in Iron Fist, and joins Cox, Ritter, and Colter for The Defenders. The Runaways cast consists of the titular group, including Rhenzy Feliz as Alex Wilder, and their parents, including Ryan Sands as Geoffrey Wilder. Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph star in Cloak & Dagger as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, respectively, while Milana Vayntrub and Derek Theler lead New Warriors as Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl and Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E
