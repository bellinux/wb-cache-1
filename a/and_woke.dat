40|$|To {{determine}} if bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times {{can be determined}} from continuous ECG recordings in the elderly, PSG (polysomnogram), ECG channels were extracted and scanned on a Holter analyzer for N= 56 participants (age 76 ± 3) in the Sleep Heart Health Study who had 2 PSGs 5 years apart. Bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were determined {{from a combination of}} 5 -min averagaed HR and HRV patterns and from HR tachograms of normal-to-normal intervals. Bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were also extracted from the PSGs. PSG- and HRV bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were compared via paired t-tests and correlation analysis. Correlations between PSG- and HRV-determined bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were 0. 95. HRV-derived bed <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> times were slightly (4 ± 7 min) earlier for and 5 ± 11 min earlier the 2 PSGs, p 0. 001. Mean PSG <b>and</b> ECG-based <b>wake</b> times were closer (12 ± 20 s earlier, p= 0. 069 and 2 ± 8 min later, p= 0. 049 for the 2 PSGs). Therefore, determination of bedtime <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> time patterns in large Holter cohorts without activity diaries is feasible. 1...|$|R
40|$|Actigraphy is {{effective}} at monitoring circadian rhythms, but often misidentifies periods of restless sleep (defined here as sleep periods with movement) as <b>wake,</b> <b>and</b> periods of quiet wake as sleep. This limitation restricts {{the effectiveness of}} actigraphy for investigating sleep disorders. Our objective {{in this study was}} to investigate a time-frequency representation of movement during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> which could ultimately aid in improving classification performance by reducing false wake detections. As a pilot study, we investigate the characteristics of manually labelled movements from six patients (aged 6 - 12 years, 3 male) during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> using the over complete discrete wavelet decomposition. The difference between the median wavelet coefficients were analyzed for 30 movement segments from six movement categories during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake.</b> We found that, in general, the temporal location of high energy coefficients and the energy of the high frequency bands differed between movements during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake.</b> This indicates that we are able to differentiate movement during sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> with a time-frequency representation. This representation may improve the sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake</b> classification performance by identifying movements specific to sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake.</b> This will likely improve the poor specificity inherent in conventional actigraphy...|$|R

25|$|The {{diversion}} of heavier bombers to the Balkans {{meant that the}} crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of KG 30 was flying on his 50th mission.

25|$|The {{captain of}} the Loch Earn, after first {{sighting}} the Ville du Havre and realising she was dangerously close, rang the ship's bell and ported his helm. The helm of the Loch Earn was put to starboard, but Ville du Havre came right across the Loch Earn's bow. The Ville du Havre was violently shaken by the collision and noise, <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> all the passengers. Confused, most passengers went on deck, only to discover the ship was rapidly sinking. The captain assured them that all was fine, but in reality the cruiser had been nearly broken in two, and it didn't take long for passengers to realize the situation was desperate. Commotion and chaos overtook panicked passengers. They started grabbing life preservers and trying to push lifeboats into the water. Unfortunately, these had recently been painted, and they were now stuck fast to the deck. Finally {{a few of them}} were yanked loose, and passengers fought desperately {{to be one of the}} few travelers to board those rescue boats.|$|E
25|$|Bragg met {{individually}} {{with his}} subordinates and informed {{them that he}} was reorganizing the Army of Tennessee into two wings. Leonidas Polk, the senior lieutenant general on the field (but junior to Longstreet), was given the right wing and command of Hill's Corps, Walker's Corps, and Cheatham's Division. Polk was ordered to initiate {{the assault on the}} Federal left at daybreak, beginning with the division of Breckinridge, followed progressively by Cleburne, Stewart, Hood, McLaws, Bushrod Johnson, Hindman, and Preston. Informed that Lt. Gen. James Longstreet had just arrived by train from Virginia, Bragg designated him as the left wing commander, commanding Hood's Corps, Buckner's Corps, and Hindman's Division of Polk's Corps. (Longstreet arrived late on the night of September 19, and had to find his way in the dark to Bragg's headquarters, since Bragg did not send a guide to meet him. Longstreet found Bragg asleep <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> him around 11 p.m. Bragg told Longstreet he would take charge of the left wing, explained his battle plan for September 20, and provided Longstreet a map of the area.) The third lieutenant general of the army, D.H. Hill, was not informed directly by Bragg of his effective demotion to be Polk's subordinate, but he learned his status from a staff officer.|$|E
25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel <b>and</b> <b>woke</b> up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E

To make matters worse, John found out that Paul was his son. Marlena was at odds with John, in an attempt to protect her grandson. Will enlisted Marlena's help, wanting Paul to leave him and Sonny alone. In an attempt to help Will, Marlena ended up heading to Italy by accident, and found Kristen. The two ended up in a struggle, and Kristen fell out of a window; she was presumed dead. Marlena returned home, but was soon captured by Stefano, who wanted revenge for Kristen's death. He planned to kill Marlena in Italy, but she was saved at the last second by Stefano's son, Chad. Marlena returned home to John and her family.|$|E

She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E
