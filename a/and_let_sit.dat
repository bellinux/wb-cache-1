Pellet Tetrahymena {{cells in}} a {{clinical}} centrifuge. *OPTIONAL: Suspend cells in HNMK (50 mM HEPES, pH 6. 9, 36 mM NaCl, 0. 1 mM Mg acetate, 1 mM KCl) for 10 - 20 min at room temperture. This will remove precipitates present in the proteose peptone and provide cleaner surfaces if cells are processed for SEM*. - Pour off most of the medium and suspend cells in a slurry (< 1 ml of remaining medium) {{at the bottom of}} the tube (be gentle). - Fix by adding 5 - 10 ml of 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7. 2. Mix gently <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>sit</b> at room temperture for 1 hr. - Gently pellet cells in the clinical centrifuge (don't pack cells). Suspend gently in 100 mM NaCacodylate, pH 7. 2. - Repeat step 4 three times. - Prepare 0. 5 - 1 % OsO 4 in NaCacodylate, pH 7. 2 and add to the fixed cells - suspend gently and incubate on ice for 30 - 60 min. - Rinse 3 X, ~ 5 min/rinse, with water (gently pelleting each time, if necessary). - Suspend final washed cells in 0. 5 - 1 % uranyl acetate (aqueous). Incubate from 30 min to overnight. - Dehydrate cells in acetone (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 3 X 100 %; 3 - 10 min/change). - Embed in [epon resin]([URL] I mix dehydrated cells with 1 / 3 plastic and 2 / 3 acetone and let them sit on a rotator for a few hours or, uncovered, overnight in the hood (on the rotator). The next day, I pellet the cells and suspend them in 100 % plastic. Suspend cells in a small amount of plastic and then underlay the suspension with 100 % plastic. Let the cells sit for several hours and place in house vacuum for ~ 1 hr. For final embedding, pellet cells, remove all plastic. Cut the tops off BEEM capsules, drop the capsules in a plastic conical centrifuge tube, and fill BEEM capsules ~half full with plastic. Suspend pelleted cells and lay over fresh plastic. Centrifuge the cells through the plastic. Remove the plastic and add additional plastic to the pelleted cells. Stirr them up a bit. Then centrifuge again (clinical centrifuge, # 7, 30 min) to pellet the cells very well. Put tubes at 40 degrees C overnight and raise to 70 - 80 degrees C for ~ 24 hrs. Polymerize at 40 degrees C overnight and raise to 65 - 80 degrees for a second day. [![DOI]([URL]...|$|E
40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory The {{best way}} to fix a sample for {{electron}} microscopy is to follow a procedure developed and proven by others. If this is not possible, this method will produce good fixation for most tissues. ### Solutions: 1. 100 mM PIPES, pH 7. 0 - 7. 4 or 50 mM Cacodylate, pH 7. 4 - 2 mM MgSO 4 - 0. 25 M sucrose - 1 - 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde - 50 mM Cacodylate, pH 7. 4 (note: cacodylate contains arsenic, so handle carefully) - 1 % OsO 4 - 1 % Uranyl acetate in water - *Osmium tetroxide and glutaraldehyde can be purchased from the EM lab*. ### Procedure: **Safety notes**: Glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide fix cells by cross-linking their proteins via the amine groups (glutaraldehyde) or their phospholipids (osmium). They are harmful to living cells and you should avoid exposure to them. I prefer to use them in a fume hood. Fixatives are volatile and can fix any cells they contact - other cells in the lab or in respiratory epithelium, corneas, epithelial cells on your hand, etc. The good {{thing is that the}} fixatives cannot penetrate tissue more than a millimeter or two, so exposure to them rarely causes any permanent damage. The plastics used to embed the tissue are more dangerous than the fixatives and many of the components of the plastic have been shown to cause cancer in rats or mice. During the embedding process the plastics are dissolved in solvent that can easily carry the plastic into your tissues and through any plastic gloves you may wear. In contrast to fixatives, whose actions are immediate and apparent, the consequences of exposure to the plastic resins are not apparent for years. Please be careful with the plastic resins prior to polymerization into hard blocks. Plastic-containing waste solutions should be kept in a container in the EM lab. 1. Fix tissue by immersion in buffered glutaraldehyde at room temp. Fix for a minimum of 30 - 60 min. Cells can be left in this solution for days if desired. - Rinse tissue out of glutaraldehyde and into 50 mM Cacodylate, pH 7. 4. Generally 2 - 4 washes of 10 min/wash is plenty to remove most of the glutaraldehyde. - Postfix tissue in the osmium tetroxide solution for 30 - 60 min. This can be done at room temperature or at 4 ûC (on ice). - Rinse the tissue in water and stain with 1 % uranyl acetate for 30 min to overnight. This helps stain the tissue and seems to help to preserve some structures. If you happen to postfix with osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer (which is commonly done), be certain to wash well with water. Uranyl acetate + phosphate forms uranyl phosphate, which forms large electron-dense crystals that will ruin the beauty of your tissue. - Dehydrate the tissue by immersion in increasing concentrations of acetone or ethanol (I prefer acetone). Try 25 % acetone/water, 50 % acetone/water, 75 % acetone/water/ and at least 2 - 3 changes in 100 % acetone. Times vary but 2 - 10 min/acetone solution is fine. - Prepare the plastic mixture. The plastics used vary from one investigator to another. One of the most popular and most stable resins is [Epon]([URL] - Another popular resin is Spurr resin, mixed as follows: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") - 7. Mix 1 / 3 plastic with 2 / 3 acetone (by volume) and add tissue to the plastic. Let sit for 1 - 2 hrs or overnight (with the container top removed to let acetone gradually evaporate). - 8. Transfer to 2 / 3 plastic + 1 / 3 acetone (by volume) for 2 - 3 hrs. - 9. Transfer to 100 % plastic <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>sit</b> for ~ 1 hr. - 10. Remove old plastic and add fresh plastic to the cells in an appropriate mold. Label the sample, and put in an embedding oven at 60 - 80 degrees for 1 - 2 days. By that time the blocks should be polymerized and ready for sectioning. [![DOI]([URL]...|$|E

Therefore, if using more than one nylon membrane per tube, the length of individual membrane sheets should be no more that 11 cm. - Preparation of Controls. Spot 1 µl of each of 5 dilutions (1 : 3. 3, 1 : 10, 1 : 33, 1 : 100, and 1 : 330) of several different probes onto DIG Quantification Teststrips. Take the loaded DIG Quantification Teststrips and a DIG Control Teststrip through the quantification procedure. Evaluate which of the probe dilution series best approaches the control teststrip. Prepare an adequate amount of this probe dilution series and store at - 80 °C for future use. - Cover the Hybaid oven door with aluminum foil. Keep the developed nylon membranes in the dark even after stopping the color reaction, otherwise they will turn completely blue over time. - Developing solution must be discarded into a properly labeled NBT/BCIP waste container. - If the probe spot is at least as intense as the 1 : 330 control spot the RNA probe reaction was successful and the RNA probe is ready to be used in hybridization. - Flies lay better in the dark. Keep the fly cages in a room without windows or cover cages with a light-tight dark cloth. - For maximum egg deposition make sure the fly food trays and yeast paste are at room temperature before placing in the fly cage. - The paste has to be easily spreadable, so that the fly food will not separate from the tray, but not too watery so that the flies will not stick to the paste. - Hybridization assays are conducted usingstaged embryos from 0 to 18 hrs post fertilization. Due to uneven egg deposition during this period, embryos are collected in 3 hr intervals (0 - 3, 3 - 6, 6 - 9, 9 - 12, 12 - 15, 15 - 18) to ensure equal representation of all developmental stages in the master mix made by combining equal amounts of embryos from each 3 hr interval. - Example of Embryo Collection Schedule ![Table 4]([URL] "Table 4 ") Carefully remove any flies that may have stuck to the fly food or the yeast paste to prevent further egg deposition. While removing the flies take care not to damage the deposited embryos. 17. Pour enough deionized H 20 on the tray to cover the entire area. Use paintbrush to collect the embryos from the tray and carefully pour them into the prepared three level sieve. The first sieve (20) will collect pieces of loose agar, the second sieve(40) will collect loose fly parts (e. g. abdomens, wings and heads) and the third sieve will collect the clean embryos. 18. Must be large enough to contain one level of the sieve and high enough so that the embryos in the sieve are can be submerged in liquid. (e. g. 100 % bleach, deionized H 20). 19. Timing of this step is critical. If the embryos are left in bleach for too long they will be irreparably damaged. 20. Heptane must be discarded into a properly labeled heptane waste container. 21. Formaldehyde/PBS mixture must be prepared fresh just prior to use. Formaldehyde is a classified as a human carcinogen and should be handled with caution and discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 22. When removing the upper (heptane) phase, start at the interphase and work your way up. Use Falcon Pipetaid. 23. Good embryos, unbroken embryos devoid of chorion and vitelline membranes, will sink to the bottom. Embryos remaining at interphase are damaged and should not be used in hybridization. 24. Methanol must be discarded into a properly labeled methanol waste container. 25. Do not put more than 7 ml of embryos in a 50 ml falcon tube. Lay the falcon tube on its side to prevent crushing the embryos. 26. The embryo master mix is created by combining equal volumes of embryos of all collected stages. It is best to measure out the individual stages in an eppendorf tube and then transfer individual time intervals into a prepared falcon tube. Let the embryos settle to ensure equal volumes. Easiest way to transfer the embryos is by turning the eppendorf tube upside down above the falcon tube and washing out the embryos with methanol using the pipetaid. 27. Waste from steps 3, 4 and 5 of the hybridization protocol (3. 2. 3) must be discarded into a properly labeled Formaldehyde waste container. 28. Use 12 ml total (9 ml methanol, 2. 88 ml PBS, 120 ul formaldehyde) -prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 29. Use 12 ml total (3 ml methanol, 8. 64 ml PBS, 360 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 30. Use 12 ml total (11. 52 ml PBS, 480 ul formaldehyde) - prepare fresh just before starting the hybridization steps. 31. Hybridization buffer with and without dextran sulfate and wash buffer must be discarded into a properly labeled Formamide waste container. 32. Even though {{there is no way to}} add exactly the same amount of embryos into each well, care needs to be taken to get as close as...|$|E
