5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an <b>aerator</b> screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E

25|$|Because grease {{skimming}} involves higher viscosity hydrocarbons, skimmers must {{be equipped}} with heaters powerful enough to keep grease fluid for discharge.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of styles of wine <b>aerators</b> and {{approaches}} to accomplish aeration. While injection-style hand-held acrylic <b>aerators</b> are currently most common, in-bottle and decanter top <b>aerators</b> are also available. Sieve-style decanter top funnels have long been used for aeration and catching sediment. <b>Aerators</b> are made from food safe-plastic or glass, and decanter top <b>aerators</b> are commonly stainless steel.|$|R

40|$|Aerated lagoons (ALs) are {{important}} variants {{of the pond}} wastewater treatment technology that have not received much attention in the literature. The hydraulic behaviour of ALs and especially the Facultative aerated lagoons (FALs) is very complex since the aeration in these systems is designed for oxygen transfer but not necessarily to create complete mixing. In this work, the energy expenditure of the <b>aerators</b> was studied {{by means of a}} scenario analysis. 3 D CFD models (one phase and multiphase) of a 3 ha FAL in a waste stabilization pond system in Cuenca (Ecuador) were built for different configurations of <b>aerators.</b> The thrust produced by the <b>aerators</b> was modelled by an external momentum source applied as velocity vectors into the pond fluid. The predictions of a single phase model were in satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Subsequently, a scenario analysis assessing several aeration schemes with different numbers of <b>aerators</b> in operation were tested with respect to velocity profiles and residence time distribution (RTD) curves. This analysis showed that the aeration scheme with all 10 <b>aerators</b> switched on produces a similar hydraulic behaviour compared to using only 6 or 8 <b>aerators.</b> The current operational schemes comprise of switching off some <b>aerators</b> during the peak hours of the day and operating all 10 <b>aerators</b> during night. This current practice could be economically replaced by continuously operating 4 or 6 <b>aerators</b> without significantly affecting the overall mixing. Furthermore, a continuous mixing regime minimises the sediment oxygen demand enhancing the oxygen levels in the pond. Cuencavol. 47; no. 1...|$|R
25|$|On recovery, the {{artefact}} {{was found}} to be in very fragile condition with the cast iron shell badly corroded and incomplete. Additionally there is evidence to suggest that the artefact is missing many of its mountings such as the <b>aerator,</b> connecting pipes and donkey engine. It is inconclusive whether these materials were removed by agents operating {{under the direction of the}} owner Charles Edward Broadhurst (1826 â€“ 26 April 1905) in the initial salvaging of the wreck in 1872 or by treasure hunters in more recent times.|$|E
25|$|Pure oxygen {{activated}} sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface <b>aerator</b> type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen atmosphere-mixed liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), {{can be controlled}} by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, pressure swing adsorption, or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of a bucket bong (or simply a [...] "bucket") calls for a large plastic bottle (about [...] ), a large bucket or other container that both the bottle and {{a large amount of}} water will properly go into, a brass cut nozzle used as the bowl, an <b>aerator</b> screen cut to fit the bowl, and a large bucket or container. The large plastic bottle's base is cut off, and the bottle's cap has a small hole in the center which will eventually hold a bowl. The screen is placed inside of the bowl. The cut nozzle is threaded into the hole outside the cap.|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} {{characteristics in}} terms of power consumption, interpreted {{in terms of}} Power number (P- 0), of unbaffled surface aeration systems consisting of flat bladed impellers, were studied in two shapes of surface aerations tanks: square and circular. Experiments were conducted in three different sizes {{in each of the}} geometrically similar unbaffled square and circular surface <b>aerators.</b> Results have shown that the P- 0 cannot be simulated singularly either with Reynolds number R or with Froude number as there are scale effects; hence {{there appears to be a}} need for incorporating the effects of both R and F. It is found that P- 0 is uniquely related to a parameter X (=(FR 1 / 3) -R- 4 / 3), which is defined as a parameter governing the theoretical power per unit volume for both shapes of aeration tanks; however, such relationships are different for both shapes of <b>aerators.</b> Interestingly P- 0 values are always higher in square surface <b>aerators</b> than in circular surface <b>aerators,</b> which suggests that the circular surface <b>aerators</b> require less power input than the square surface <b>aerators.</b> The usefulness of such correlations was demonstrated in estimating the power requirement while achieving a required oxygen transfer coefficient in surface <b>aerators...</b>|$|R
50|$|Stabilization ponds, as {{described}} here, use no <b>aerators.</b> High-performance lagoon technology with <b>aerators</b> {{has much more}} in common with that of activated sludge. Such aerated lagoons are common in small towns in the United States, among other places.|$|R
50|$|Jet <b>aerators</b> do {{not require}} any {{external}} air source (i.e. compressor), except for the surrounding atmosphere. Jet <b>aerators</b> can be installed either as submersible units or piped through the tank wall using an external dry-installed chopper pump to feed the aspirating ejector(s). Jet <b>aerators</b> are easily configured into any basin geometry including circular, rectangular, looped reactors and sloped wall basins. Jet <b>aerators</b> are ideally suited for deep tank processes. The jet oxidation ditch {{is an example of}} technology innovation where the combination of a deeper basin design, bottom to top mixing and conservation of momentum combines to make a very efficient treatment process. In this and other applications the independent control of oxygen transfer and mixing is a valuable feature for both process control and energy savings.|$|R

2500|$|The F/M is {{the ratio}} of food fed to the {{microorganisms}} each day to the mass of microorganisms held under aeration. Specifically, it {{is the amount of}} BOD fed to the <b>aerator</b> (lbs/day) divided by the amount (lbs) of Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids (MLVSS) under aeration. Note: [...] Some references use MLSS (Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids) for expedience, but MLVSS is considered more accurate for the measure of microorganisms. Again, due to expedience, COD is generally used, in lieu of BOD, as BOD takes five days for results.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the strength of the association between the isolation of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) from tap water faucet <b>aerators</b> and the prevalence of colonization or infection of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Surveillance cultures were obtained during a 4 -month period from 162 faucet <b>aerators</b> located in seven different ICUs. The prevalence of colonization or infection of ICU patients with NFGNB was determined by prospective surveillance during the same period. Fifty four (33 %) of the faucet <b>aerators</b> contained NFGNB. Among the 66 NFGNB isolated from faucet <b>aerators,</b> the most frequently encountered ones were Sphingomonas paucimobili (26 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 isolates), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (13 isolates), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (6 isolates), Burkholderia cepacia (4 isolates), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (3 isolates). Acinetobacter baumannii was not recovered. The most common NFGNB isolated from ICU patients were P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. There was a significant correlation between the overall prevalence of NFGNB in faucet <b>aerators</b> and their prevalence in exposed ICU patients (Spearman r = 0. 821, P = 0. 02). There was also a significant correlation between the prevalence of C. meningosepticum in faucet <b>aerators</b> and its prevalence among ICU patients (Spearman r = 0. 847, P = 0. 016).

50|$|Floating surface <b>aerators</b> work in {{a similar}} manner to fountains, but they do not offer the same {{aesthetic}} appearance.

Floating surface <b>aerators</b> are also powered by on-shore electricity. Surface <b>aerators</b> are limited to a small area as they are unable to add circulation or oxygen to much more than a 3-metre radius. This circulation and oxygenating is then limited to the first portion of the water column, often leaving the bottom portions unaffected.|$|R
