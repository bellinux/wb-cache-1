50|$|De Valence v Langley Fox Building Partnership (Pty) Ltd is an {{important}} case in South African law, heard by the Witwatersrand Local Division. On 13 August 1982, the respondent, Mrs Patricia Poupinel de Valence, was a successful <b>audiometrician.</b> She conducted a private practice in partnership with a Mr Carter. On that day she was walking on a sidewalk outside Hunt's Corner, a building situate in the central business district of Johannesburg. A wooden beam had been suspended between two trestles at right-angles across the sidewalk. The respondent struck {{the left side of}} her forehead against the beam. At first the injury caused thereby was thought to have been minor. However, it had the most serious and unfortunate consequences for the respondent.|$|E

Comparing the worst hearing threshold {{at any of the}} three tested frequencies, the general practitioner did not find any ears to hear more than 10 dB better than the hospital (no false negatives). However, there were six false positives (9 %) where the general practitioner identified an apparent hearing loss of greater than 15 dB. It is concluded that pure {{tone audiometry}} could be carried out accurately in the practice...|$|R
