50|$|Another {{example is}} in the {{proposed}} biosynthesis of <b>aranotin,</b> a naturally occurring oxepine, and its related compounds.|$|E
50|$|Enzymatic {{epoxidation}} of phenylalanine-derived diketopiperazine {{forms the}} arene oxide, which undergoes a 6Ï€ disrotatory ring opening electrocyclization reaction {{to produce the}} uncyclized oxepine. After a second epoxidation of the ring, the nearby nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbon, forming a five membered ring. The resulting ring system is a common ring system found in <b>aranotin</b> and its related compounds.|$|E
