50|$|AH and AHL {{amyloidosis}} {{are extremely}} rare forms of systemic amyloidosis {{in which the}} <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposit</b> is a free heavy chain (AH amyloidosis) or a free heavy chain plus free light chain (AHL amyloidosis). Case reports have detected amyloid deposits containing a free γ, α, or μ heavy chain (or portions {{of one of these}} chains) accompanied in many cases by a free κ or λ light chain in primarily in the kidney but also the spleen and other tissues. AH plus AHL amyloidosis cases are ~17-fold less common than AL amyloidosis cases. The disease often presents late in its course with signs and/or symptoms of kidney failure such as those associated with the nephrotic syndrome and is therefore treated as a malignant condition. In a small study of 16 patients with renal amyloidosis, the 5 patients with AH amyloidosis and the 11 patients with AHL amyloidosis had less frequent concurrent cardiac involvement and better overall survival than 202 patients with renal AL amyloidosis. The hematological response to chemotherapy of the AH and AHL renal amyloidosis patients was comparable to those with renal AL amyloidosis.|$|E

In this study, we examined the role of apoE in amyloidogenesis in vivo in apoE-deficient mutant mice with amyloid A protein (AA) amyloidosis induced by inflammatory stimulation. Amyloid deposition was seen in six of nine C 57 BL/ 6 J control mice and in six of eight apoE-deficient mutant mice after the intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections of the mixture of complete Freund's adjuvant and Mycobacterium butyricum.

40|$|Pancreatic islet <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> are a {{characteristic}} pathologic feature of {{non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus}} and contain islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP; amylin). We used transgenic mice that express human IAPP in pancreatic beta cells to explore the potential role of islet amyloid in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Extensive <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were observed in the pancreatic islets of approximately 80 % of male transgenic mice > 13 months of age. Islet <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were rarely observed in female transgenic mice (11 %) and were never seen in nontransgenic animals. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that these deposits were composed of human IAPP-immunoreactive fibrils that accumulated between beta cells and islet capillaries. Strikingly, {{approximately half of the}} mice with islet <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were hyperglycemic (plasma glucose > 11 mM). In younger (6 - to 9 -month-old) male transgenic mice, islet <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were less commonly observed but were always associated with severe hyperglycemia (plasma glucose > 22 mM). These data indicate that expression of human IAPP in beta cells predisposes male mice to the development of islet amyloid and hyperglycemia. The frequent concordance of islet amyloid with hyperglycemia in these mice suggests an interdependence of these two conditions and supports the hypothesis that islet amyloid {{may play a role in}} the development of hyperglycemia...|$|R
