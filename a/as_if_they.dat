5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E

5|$|Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a {{reorganization}} of the family Hygrophoraceae based on molecular phylogenetics, proposed that H.appalachianensis should be the type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H.rosea, and H.trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have perforations in the center. Their spores and basidia are dimorphic (of two sizes), {{and the development of}} the microbasidia and macrobasidia is often staggered. The macrobasidia are club shaped and appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have a stalk.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{are the source of}} light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E

5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the beliefs of other characters in the novel.

5|$|If {{someone is}} {{found guilty of}} an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act.

5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, {{which have the}} same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E
