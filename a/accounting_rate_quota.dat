For several sub-Saharan African countries, the value of EU tariff preferences, even without <b>accounting</b> for tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quota</b> rents, is worth a significant proportion of their world exports. For non-African Least Developed Countries, in contrast, we find that the EBA initiative was only half-utilised approximately, although it is the only preferential regime available to most of them. It is difficult to reach a firm conclusion since 2001 was the first year of enforcement of Everything But Arms (EBA), and figures for 2002 show utilisation is on the rise, but rules of origin appear to limit significantly the value of this scheme.

The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture. Following the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade liberalization all nontariff barriers to trade were converted, through the process of tariffication, into tariffs. However, in the dairy sector, the border measure most commonly adopted by developed countries was a system of tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas.</b> Tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> are two-tiered tariffs which allow a small quantity of the product to be imported at a low or zero tariff, while quantities above the minimum access amount are charged much higher and often prohibitive tariffs. Tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> cause the excess supply curve facing an importing country to be discontinuous at the minimum access amount. The objective of this paper is to review key issues related to modeling trade liberalization for the international dairy economy, given the existence of tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> and export subsidies.

Four possible agreements between Europe and Mercosur are simulated, including a broader multilateral agreement proposed in the G 20. The results suggest that a bilateral scenario involving larger tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quota</b> increase, as called for by Mercosur, generates larger gains than accepting the European Union proposal of 2004 or further multilateral trade liberalization based on the G 20 proposal.

This article evaluates the developmental relevance of TRQs and discusses how the various methods TRQ administration methods influence market access in Switzerland for agricultural products from developing countries. The findings show that existing TRQ management in Switzerland is complicated and lacks transparency. Further, the manner in which TRQs are administered results in high transaction costs, a situation that fails to liberate trade opportunities from rents and influences trade flows of the partner countries. Proposed reforms are establishment of a more efficient administrative mechanism, modalities to liberalize trade with TRQs through reduction of out-of-quota tariffs, and capacity building in developing countries; such reforms would maximize market access opportunities from a development perspective. developing countries, Switzerland, tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas,</b> Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, International Development, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

Article X 111 of the GATT regarding the rules for historical allocation is examined and applied to four cases of historical allocation: domestic tobacco quota and TRQs for peanuts, sugar and tobacco.

Each of the four remaining groups finds the ori-gin of its TRQs in a quota imposed to sustain a domestic price support program.

Abstract Explicit modeling of tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> (TRQs) is important in the current World Trade Organization negotiations. In order to do such modeling with GTAP, extra data is required and extra equations must be added to the model. This paper provides tools for assisting modelers to carry out explicit modeling of bilateral tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> in GTAP using GEMPACK. The paper describes how the extra data for sugar TRQ applications was obtained and reconciled with the standard GTAP data. Supplied with the paper is a TABLO Input file TRQDATA. TAB which others can use for reconciling their TRQ data with the usual GTAP data. Supplied with the paper is a module which can be added to the standard TABLO Input files for GTAP. This module contains the extra equations required to model TRQs. Detailed hands-on examples are supplied with the paper, as is a TRQ application relating to a partial liberalization of sugar TRQ. Readers of the paper can replicate these applications. A windows interface TRQmate is supplied with the paper. This is a relatively general-purpose interface which automates the steps in carrying out TRQ applications with GTAP and GEMPACK. If you wish to carry out your own bilateral TRQ applications with GTAP and GEMPACK, the tools supplied with this paper will make it relatively straightforward for you to do so once you have collected the extra data you need. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} the current Doha Round of the WTO {{negotiations}} on agriculture will require substantial reform {{in each of the}} three areas of market access, export subsidies and domestic support. Substantial improvement in market access for agricultural products will be an essential requirement for achieving a successful outcome. However, the extent of improvement in market access resulting from the current negotiations will largely depend on the form and the approach followed to reduce tariffs and expand tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas.</b> In this paper different approaches to expanding market access for grains area analysed using a partial equilibrium model. Simulated scenarios include linear reductions in applied tariffs and expansions in tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas,</b> which are contrasted with a scenario representing market access proposals of the Cairns Group of countries in the current WTO agricultural negotiations. The effects of these two trade liberalisation scenarios on world prices and trade are analysed and discussed. Results indicate that to achieve a meaningful gain in market access for grains, WTO members must agree to either directly reduce the current applied tariffs or make large percentage reductions to the WTO bound rates, which lead to effective reductions in the current applied rates.

40|$|The ongoing trade negotiations, {{unilateral}} trade {{concessions and}} {{obligations under the}} WTO are pushing the EU sugar regime to undertake reforms. These reforms will alter the positions of developing countries in the global sugar markets. Gradual changes within the tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> in the EU sugar regime would have a very marginal impact on the flow of sugar exports to the EU and world sugar markets as well. The simulation {{results showed that the}} scheduled changes in tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> and transition period are stalling the impacts of tariff liberalisation granted by the EBA concession. Small concessions will not threaten the EU internal market, but total liberalisation of sugar imports from the LDCs will be a major threat to the EU sugar regime. Conversely, the EU would gain from the liberalisation scenarios in welfare terms due to cheaper imports of sugar. The current regime limits sugar imports from all developing countries or some efficient producers, if the cost data is a right estimate of the potential supply response from developing countries. The supply responses, which strongly affect the outcomes, are dependent on both the nature of substitution for sugar {{as well as on the}} efficiency of sugar production in different countries.

40|$|Since 2004 {{there has}} been a sharp {{decrease}} in border protection for the EU rice industry. Because the EU grants trade preferences to a considerable number of rice exporting developing countries, the reform implied preference erosion as well. By addressing the impact of preference erosion on developing countries rice exports to the EU, this paper contributes two original insights to the literature: first, by proposing a new empirical approach to compute the preference margin when tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> are in force which {{is based on the assumption}} of the existence of fixed costs and economies of scale in international trade; second, by estimating the trade elasticities of preferences by means of a dynamic panel gravity equation to deal with the issues of endogeneity of preferences and persistency in bilateral trade flows. The results show that the way preference margins are calculated matters significantly when assessing the existence and extent of their erosion and the values of trade elasticities. Finally, the estimations highlight the fact that the impact of preferences is still very strong for some of the countries concerned.
