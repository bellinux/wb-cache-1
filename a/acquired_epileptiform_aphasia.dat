40|$|Landau-Kleffner {{syndrome}} (LKS), or <b>acquired</b> <b>epileptiform</b> <b>aphasia,</b> is an epilepsy syndrome involving progressive neuropsychological impairment {{related to}} the appearance of paroxysmal electroencephalograph (EEG) activity. LKS appears to share a common pathophysiologic mechanism with continuous spike-wave of sleep (CSWS), acquired epileptic opercular syndrome (AEOS), and even benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), with differentiating factors including age of onset, area of primary epileptogenicity, and severity of clinical presentation. This article covers the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic features of LKS. In a child with autistic spectrum disorder, {{the presence of a}} fluctuating clinical course or regression should raise suspicion for the presence of associated epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Landau-Kleffner {{syndrome}} (LKS) is epileptiform aphasia acquired {{during childhood}} and occurring {{in children with}} previously normal language devel-opment. The epileptiform activity in these children is thought {{to result in a}} functional ablation of eloquent speech areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the usefulness of mag-netoencephalography (MEG) for localizing the source of epileptiform activity in these patients. METHODS: Nineteen patients with acquired aphasia and a suspected diagnosis of LKS were referred for MEG evaluation. Patients ranged in age from 4 to 14 years. Fourteen MEG studies were performed on a 74 -channel system, four on a 148 -channel whole-head system, and one on a 37 -channel system. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 19 patients had perisylvian MEG spikes. In 10 of the patients, the spikes were bilateral, and in three they were unilateral. Four other patients had non-sylvian spikes, and two patients had no spikes recorded. The results of MR imaging were normal or noncontributory for all 19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MEG can play a useful role in evaluating children with LKS and <b>acquired</b> <b>epileptiform</b> <b>aphasia,</b> both in diagnosis and in aiding presurgical localization of epileptifor...|$|E
