5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670.

5|$|A chapel in {{the village}} was first {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Survey in 1086. The Norman church of St Andrew was first constructed in 1160 after the previous chapel was demolished. The church has flint walls whereas its chancel has cemented walls, along with windows dating from the 14th century. The church was restored in the 19th century, along with a nave extension <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> a new chancel arch. The churchyard has a Grade II listed war memorial which is dedicated to fallen soldiers of the First World War. The memorial {{is made out of}} Cornish granite and features a Celtic cross with a crusader's sword sculpted in its centre; it was unveiled on 17 October 1920 by Admiral Jervoise and dedicated by the rector of St Andrew's Church.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} investigations {{were carried}} out to evaluate the rheological behaviour of fly ash (FA) slurry without <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> bottom ash (BA) and BA slurry without <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> FA. <b>The</b> FA slurries exhibited Bingham behaviour at solid mass concentrations ranging from 60 – 65 % and mixing proportions from 10 – 40 %. A substantial reduction in yield stress was observed except for mixing proportion of 40 % on which <b>the</b> yield stress <b>and</b> viscosity were increased drastically for all solid concentrations. Hence, {{it can be concluded}} that <b>the</b> yield stress <b>and</b> viscosity of FA slurry were very much influenced by adding BA up to the mixing proportion of 30 %. The rheological behaviour of BA slurries with <b>and</b> without <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> FA in proportions of 10 – 50 % was investigated and exhibited Newtonian behaviours for solid mass concentrations ranging from 30 – 50 % without <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> FA. <b>The</b> viscosity increases with increasing <b>the</b> solid concentrations <b>and</b> proportion of FA. Based on these experimental data, a correlation was developed to predict the relative viscosity of BA slurries as a function of solid volume fraction and FA mass proportion of 0 – 50 % <b>and</b> <b>the</b> RMSE <b>and</b> R 2 values showed good agreement between <b>the</b> experimental <b>and</b> <b>the</b> predicted data...|$|R

5|$|After the Union of Lublin, the Senate {{of general}} sejm of the Commonwealth became {{augmented}} by Lithuanian high officials; {{the position of}} the lay and ecclesiastical lords, who served for life as members of the Senate was strengthened, as the already outnumbered middle szlachta high office holders had now proportionally fewer representatives in the upper chamber. The Senate could also be convened separately by the king in its traditional capacity of the royal council, apart from any sejm's formal deliberations, and szlachta's attempts to limit the upper chamber's role had not been successful. After the formal union <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> deputies from the Grand Duchy, and Royal Prussia, also more fully integrated with the Crown in 1569, there were about 170 regional deputies in the lower chamber (referred to as the Sejm) and 140 senators.|$|E

5|$|Before Donkey Kong Countrys production, Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper {{invested}} and programmed {{experiments with}} a Silicon Graphics Challenge workstation, with their initial focus centred on a boxing game. Although never reaching beyond {{the stages of}} initial development, senior Nintendo staff who visited their Twycross studio were impressed with their progress after being shown a working demo. Genyo Takeda was dispatched to Japan to advise then-president of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi on securing a deal with Rare. Following talks between Yamauchi and Rare staff, Nintendo acquired 49% of the company, which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> Rare as a second-party developer. The Stampers expressed interest in making a game based on Donkey Kong and were given Nintendo's permission.|$|E
