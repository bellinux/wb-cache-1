5|$|After {{becoming}} a cause célèbre {{from the late}} 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard as <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> his claim of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many conspiracy theorists still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion is an age-old cabal that conceals a subversive secret.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{commercial}} traffic ceasing in 1907, the infrastructure was maintained in good order, and the canal {{was used for}} the transport of potable water from 1962. The Countryside Act 1968 provided <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> Somerset County Council to start the restoration of the canal as a leisure facility, which was completed in 1994, when the canal was reopened throughout. Bridgwater Docks have been restored as a marina, but there is no navigable connection to the River Parrett, as the canal still transports drinking water for the people of Bridgwater.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics. Phenomenology is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. String phenomenology {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.|$|E

Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed at, for instance, the Large Hadron Collider.|$|E

5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations.

The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.|$|E

Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.|$|E
