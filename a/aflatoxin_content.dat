Zn content of unamended feed (< 20 ppm [20 μg/g]) is normally supplemented with a mineral premix containing Zn, Mn, Fe, and Cu to meet the nutrient requirements of chickens (40 ppm of Zn). The mean zinc concentration of the feed samples (117 ppm) was about threefold greater than the nutrient requirement and ranged from 58 to 162 ppm in individual samples. These field survey results parallel earlier reports of augmented production of aflatoxin in monocultures of aflatoxigenic fungi in corn and other ingredients supplemented with Zn.

40|$|Study was {{conducted}} on different cereals (wheat, rice, sorghum) and oil seeds (sunflowerseed, cottonseed, groundnut) to correlate bright greenish yellow fluorescence (BGYF) of the seeds under longwave (366 nm) ultraviolet light with aflatoxin presence. Correlation between BGYF, aflatoxin and kojic acid contents and peroxidase units indicated that samples showing BGYF were not always contaminated with aflatoxins but those which contained aflatoxins, always exhibited BGYF. It was further noticed that all the samples, that showed BGY fluorescence and aflatoxin presence were loaded with spores of Aspergillus flavus. Aflatoxin positive samples also had high moisture contents. Storage of the BGYF and aflatoxin positive samples showed that storage in the dark increased the <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> and in the light, the <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> was reduced. Some varieties of cereals and oil seeds were contaminated with toxic strain of A. flavus. Results showed positive relationship between BGYF and aflatoxin production. Varieties with high quantities of aflatoxin also showed high quantities of kojic acid. Some varieties showed profused growth which was accompanied by increased production of aflatoxin and BGYF units. Activity-of enzyme peroxidase varied from variety to variety.

Maize samples from the Guinea Savannah zone (SG) exhibited lower <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> and colony-forming units (cfu) than those collected from the Sudan Savannah (SS) zone. In maize, aflatoxin concentration and cfu of A. flavus varied with cultivars, shelling practices and storage methods. The maize variety Jaune de Bambey had high aflatoxin levels in both agro-ecological zones. <b>Aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> in machine-shelled maize (120 ng ⁄ g) was more than 10 -fold higher than that in manually shelled (8 ng ⁄ g) or unshelled maize. <b>Aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> (between 0. 1 and 1. 2 ng ⁄ g) and cfu values (between 13 and 42 000 cfu ⁄ g) of sesame were low, suggesting a low susceptibility to A. flavus.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to {{optimize}} the radiation dose for maximum reduction of <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> by varying the distance between the contaminated peanut samples and the UV-C light source and duration of exposure to UV-C light. Studies were also undertaken to evaluate the effect of UV-C exposure on the various quality parameters of peanuts. Two different studies were conducted in a sterilized wooden box fitted with a 15 W UV-C tube in the centre {{at the top of the}} box, where the contaminated samples were placed at a distance of 15 cm and 30 cm respectively from the UV-C light source. The duration of the exposure was varied from 2 h to 12 h. The fungicidal activity of UV-C radiation was found to be more pronounced in peanuts exposed at a distance of 15 cm. Maximum reduction of aflatoxin concentration in both the studies was found after 10 h of exposure. In the studies, conducted at a distance of 15 cm, aflatoxin concentration reduced to 99. 1 % (350 ppb to 3 ppb) with decrease in fungal count to < 10 cfug- 1 and at a distance of 30 cm, reduction of 97. 4 % (350 ppb to 9 ppb) of the <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> with< 10 cfug- 1 of fungal count was observed. However, the quality parameters including nutritional values and physico-chemical parameters of peanuts remained relatively unaffected (within the national and international regulatory limits). The present study thus provides a validated practical method of using UV-C irradiation to reduce aflatoxin contamination in peanuts, intended to be used for the purpose of food and feed...|$|E
40|$|The carcinogenic, {{embryotoxic}} and immunotoxic {{properties of}} areca nuts are well documented. The nuts may also contain aflatoxins, but these {{have not been}} adequately quantified In products. The latter and the variable nut consumption pattern among chewers make estimations of exposure to aflatoxins and hence their contribution to the overall toxicity of the nut difficult. The <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>content</b> and incidence of fungi of boiled, baked and raw areca nut samples procured from different commercial outlets were determined. Only the raw, sliced nut samples contained aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2 (3. 5 - 26. 2 μg kg- 1). Forty per cent of these samples contained aflatoxin B 1 {{in excess of the}} commonly accepted foodstuff limit of 5 μg kg- 1. Based on areca nut consumption data of South African Indians, it was calculated that chewers of raw areca nut may be exposed to total aflatoxin (B 1 + B 2 + G 1 + G 2) quantities of 3. 6 - 1080 ng per 24 h. Raw nut samples were relatively heavily contaminated with Aspergillus flavus, the counts of which corresponded with their <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>content.</b> Boiled nut samples harboured A. glaucus species which were not present on either baked or raw nuts. It was concluded that in such countries as India and Taiwan, chewers of raw areca may be exposed to concentrations of aflatoxins which may enhance the carcinogenic effects of these nuts on human tissues. It is unlikely, however, based on data regarding areca nut consumption among South African chewers, that the levels of aflatoxin on these nuts pose a health hazard. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Shelled peanuts of Gajah var. with initial {{moisture}} content of 7 % were stored at 11 kg/bag in four bag types namely: jute bag, polypropylene bag, jute bag doubled with thin polyethylene (PE), and jute bag doubled with thick PE. Storage {{was done for}} six months under warehouse conditions with monitoring of relative humidity and temperature. Samples taken at the be ginning of storage and every month thereafter were analyzed for moisture <b>content,</b> fungal population, <b>aflatoxin</b> and free fatty acid contents. Statistical analyses showed that {{moisture content}}, fungal population, and free fatty acid contents were signifi cantly higher in jute and polypropylene bags than in PE-dou,bled jute bags. No significant differences were obtained in <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>contents</b> among bag types {{but at the end}} of six months storage, toxin level in jute bag exceeded the 30 ppb limit. Polypropylene had second highest toxin level at 23 ppb. The PE-doubled bags ha d 17 and 19 ppb total aflatoxins for thin and thick films, respectively. The results indicated that the immediate packag ing of dried shelled peanuts at safe moisture level in plastic films with water vapor transmission rated of 1 g/m 2 / 24 hr or lower is recommended. This p ackaging will delay critical increases in moisture <b>content,</b> fungal population, <b>aflatoxin</b> and free fatty acid contents of peanut kernels at ambient storage conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{aflatoxin}} {{distribution in}} corn fractions obtained after visual segregation for defects in 30 samples, {{known to be}} contaminated, was studied. Each sample was passed through a 5. 0 mm round holes sieve, graded for defects and then segregated in sound kernels (regular kernels) and non-sound kernels (injured, germinated, fermented, moldy, heated, insect damaged, immature, broken, hollow, fermented up to ¼, discolored, extraneous materials, and injured by other causes), {{as defined by the}} Brazilian Official Grading rules for corn. The non-sound kernels showed the highest contamination levels in all samples. The contamination levels of non-sound kernels (20 % of total weight) ranged from 23 to 1, 365 µg/kg of aflatoxins (B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2) and were higher than sound kernels (p< 1 %) ranging from not detected (ND) to 126 µg/kg and in 87 % of these the <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>contents</b> were lower than 20 µg/kg. Statistically significant correlation indexes were found among the percentage of defective groups like fermented, heated and sprouted kernels or the total injured kernels, and the estimated contamination levels for the sound and non sound fractions. It was concluded that the non-sound kernels fraction, even being small in weight, has contributed with 84 % of the estimated contamination of the samples. The segregation of the non-sound kernels would favor a reduction in the contamination of corn lots. The poorer quality corn types (types 3 and Bellow Standart) have predominated among samples of the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the physical quality, Aspergillus flavus population and <b>aflatoxin</b> B 1 <b>content</b> of raw peanut kernels collected from retailers in two traditional markets (pasar Anyar and pasar Bogor) in the city of Bogor in August 2009. The number of samples collected from pasar Anyar and pasar Bogor was 14 and 12, respectively. Physical quality of kernels was determined based on the percentage of intact, shriveled and damaged kernels. Damaged kernels consisted of broken and damaged kernels caused by insect or fungal attack. Aspergillus flavus population was determined using serial dilution method followed by pour plating method on aspergillus flavus and parasiticus agar. <b>Aflatoxin</b> B 1 <b>content</b> was determined using thin layer chromatography method. The results showed, that the mean of percentage of intact, shriveled and damaged kernels of peanuts collected from pasar Anyar was 70. 6, 12. 3 and 17. 1 %, respectively; while that of collected from pasar Bogor was 60. 2, 12. 7 and 27. 1 %, respectively. The mean of A. flavus populations in peanuts collected from pasar Anyar and pasar Bogor was 8194 cfu g - 1 and 983 cfu g - 1, respectively. The mean of <b>aflatoxin</b> B 1 <b>content</b> in peanuts collected from pasar Anyar and pasar Bogor was 2. 0 ppb and 91. 4 ppb, respectively. The percentage of peanut samples containing aflatoxin B 1 more than 15 ppb and collected from pasar Anyar and pasar Bogor was 7. 1 % and 25 %, respectively. </p...|$|R
