40|$|In deep {{sub-micron}} technologies with {{critical dimensions}} below 100 nm, the impactof variability on circuit performance becomes unacceptably large. At the same time,novel {{applications such as}} high-end mobile devices require a significant reduction inenergy consumption per operation. Embedded memories {{are one of the}} most criticalbuilding blocks in these contemporary systems, and they {{are one of the most}} likelytechnical bottlenecks for further scaling. Typical low power mobile applications are implemented using a heterogeneousmulticore architecture at system level. A novel, dynamic ram based, memoryarchitecture is proposed for such systems, that could be used for scratchpad memoriesand datapads. This low power DRAM (LPDRAM) architecture can bring an energyconsumption improvement over existing implementations of level 2 and 3 memories. This work will focus on studying circuit level LPDRAM implementations for level 2 scratchpads. Not every DRAM technology is suited to implement LPDRAM. This is due to thefocus put on improving the power consumption. This work studies implementationsfor two technologies: eDRAM and 3 DDRAM. eDRAM technology offers higherdensity compared with SRAM at the cost of increased energy consumption andcomplexity. New optimized DRAM architectures are also being developed for use in 3 D interconnected systems, and should be suitable for mobile applications. This thesisproposes to use both technologies to implement LPDRAM, under the assumption thatsuch technologies becomes available. Different types of SRAM cells and DRAM matrices are studied, to show that themain limitation for using eDRAM is their latency, while stand alone DRAM matricesare mainly limited by their high dynamic energy per access. The electrical factorsresponsible for these differences (longer bitlines, larger memory matrices, etc [...] .) areidentified, and the principles for a DRAM architecture alleviating these penalties isproposed. It is shown that in a typical embedded system working at a reasonably highspeed (around 1 GHz in 90 nm), using modified bitline architecture could bring a lowerstatic energy per bit as well as a higher density than embedded SRAM for L 2 memories. Two prototypes are designed, demonstrating improved dynamic energy consumptionand density, when compared with state of the art SRAM matrices.

Different formulations have been developed in an effort to improve medication adherence. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore whether there are differential clinical outcomes between two different formulations of olanzapine (orodispersible tablets [ODTs] vs standard oral tablets [SOT]) for the treatment of nonadherent patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Methods: Data for this analysis were from an observational study conducted in Europe (N= 903). Adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients in outpatient settings who initiated or changed to either olanzapine ODT or SOT according to physician decision within the last 45 days were eligible for enrollment. The follow-up period was 1 year. Of the 903 participants, 266 nonadherent patients (Medication Adherence Rating Scale score 0 – 4 at baseline) were included in the analysis. Clinical outcomes of interest were: 1) hospitalization and 2) relapse identified by the participating psychiatrist or hospitalization. An adjusted logistic regression model was fitted. Results: Patients taking ODT had more severe illness at baseline (P< 0. 001) as assessed with the Clinical Global Impression with mean (standard deviation [SD]) scores of ODT <b>4.</b> 63 (<b>1.</b> 03) and SOT <b>4</b> (<b>1.</b> 16).

The patients received teriparatide 20 µg daily by subcutaneous injection, for a maximum of 24 months. Safety and effectiveness analyses were based on data from 1, 847 patients who were predominantly female (92. 6 %) {{with a mean age of}} 75. 4 years. A total of 157 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 140 (7. 58 %) patients; the most common ADRs were hyperuricemia, nausea, and dizziness. Only six (0. 32 %) patients reported serious ADRs, the most common being nausea (two patients; 0. 1 %). Persistence with teriparatide treatment was 60. 8 % and 39. 1 % at 18 and 24 months, respectively. There were significant increases in biomarkers for bone formation (procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) and bone resorption (collagen type I cross-linked C telopeptide and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 b) throughout the study. These were accompanied by significant increases in bone mineral density and low incidences of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Patient-reported measurements for health-related quality of life revealed significant improvements from baseline in back pain and overall health-related quality of life (Short Form- 8 ™ health survey). The results of this 24 -month {{postmarketing surveillance}} study imply that teriparatide has a favorable safety profile and is effective in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture in Japan.

The {{objective of this}} study was to describe physicians’ and patients’ perceptions of response to tNSAIDs as measured by satisfaction with control of patients’ osteoarthritis (OA). Patients and methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 2009 in Germany, Spain, and the UK. Linked physician and patient questionnaires collected data on OA management, degree of pain and disability, and satisfaction with OA control. Results: The study included 363 treating physicians and 713 patients receiving tNSAIDs. Patient mean (standard deviation) age was 65. 5 (11. 0) years (range 36 – 94 years); 60 % were women; 86 % were white; and one-quarter were obese. Dissatisfaction with control of patients’ OA was expressed by physicians or their patients, or both, for 51 % of patients, including 208 patients (31 %) with mild OA and 478 patients (60 %) with moderate or severe OA. Overall, 37 % of patients reported dissatisfaction and 34 % had a physician who reported dissatisfaction. Patient and physician assessments were the same in 70 % of cases; Cohen’s κ coefficient was 0. 34 (95 % confidence interval 0. 26 – 0. 41), indicating fair agreement. Of those reporting dissatisfaction, most physicians (79 %) and patients (64 %) believed that the current control was the best that could be achieved. The most common reasons for which physicians reported dissatisfaction were inadequate response (56 %), side effects (11. 1 %), and poor tolerance (7. 8 %). Conclusion: One-half of patients or their treating physicians were dissatisfied with the control of OA provided by tNSAID therapy; moreover, most believed it was the best control that could be achieved.

40|$|Observational {{constraints}} to biomass burning (BB) NOx emissions as {{provided by}} satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) critically depend on quantitative assumptions regarding the atmospheric NOx lifetime. In this study, we investigated NOx emissions from the extreme wildfires {{that occurred in}} the European part of Russia in summer 2010 by using an original inverse modeling method that allowed us to avoid any a priori assumptions regarding the NOx lifetime. The method was applied to the tropospheric NO 2 columns retrieved from the measurements performed by the OMI satellite instrument, while the relationship between BB NOx emissions and tropospheric NO 2 columns was simulated with the CHIMERE mesoscale chemistry transport model. Our analysis indicated that this relationship depends strongly on BB emissions of volatile organic compounds and that a dependence of the effective NOx lifetime on the NOx fluxes can be essentially nonlinear.

To our knowledge, there is no data on parecoxib following major gastrointestinal surgery. This study assessed the efficacy and opioid-sparing effects of parecoxib following major gastrointestinal surgeries. Patients and methods: Patients in this analysis were a subset from a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of parecoxib following noncardiac surgeries and consisted of those undergoing {{a variety of}} major gastrointestinal surgeries via laparotomy. Pain, pain interference with function, supplemental opioid utilization, opioid-related symptoms, and Patient/Physician Global Evaluation of Study Medication were compared between placebo and parecoxib groups in the 2 − 3 days following surgery. Results: Significantly (p< 0. 001) lower pain scores were observed in the parecoxib group (n= 111), relative to placebo (n= 126), on Day 2 (− 33 %) and Day 3 (− 35 %). Pain interference with function scores was also significantly (p< 0. 001) lower among patients receiving parecoxib compared with placebo on Day 2 (− 29 %) and Day 3 (− 36 %). At 24, 48, and 72 hours, the cumulative amount of supplemental morphine consumed was 45 %, 41 %, and 40 % less in patients receiving parecoxib compared with placebo (all p< 0. 001). The risk of experiencing ≥ 1 opioid-related symptoms was also significantly lower with parecoxib than with placebo on Day 2 (relative risk= 0. 75; p< 0. 001). Specifically, the risks of fatigue and drowsiness were significantly (both p< 0. 05) lower in patients receiving parecoxib compared to those receiving placebo. Patient and Physician Global Evaluation of Study Medication scores were significantly better in the parecoxib group than {{in the placebo group}} (p< 0. 001).

Materials and methods: Based on 1996 – 2011 {{data from the}} Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a large, nationally representative US database, multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationship between AVD and MVD and direct annual health-care costs to insurers and patients, at individual and US-aggregate levels. Adults aged 18 years and over with diagnosis codes for AVD or MVD based on International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision) diagnosis codes were identified. Subjects were further classified as symptomatic AVD, asymptomatic AVD, symptomatic MVD, and asymptomatic MVD. These classifications were determined with clinical assistance and {{based in part on}} data availability in the MEPS. Results: The MEPS database included 148 patients with AVD: 53 patients with symptomatic AVD, 95 patients with asymptomatic AVD, and 1, 051 with MVD, including 315 patients with symptomatic MVD and 736 patients with asymptomatic MVD. Symptomatic AVD had the largest incremental effect on annual per patient health-care expenditure: $ 12, 789 for symptomatic AVD, $ 10, 816 for asymptomatic AVD, $ 5, 163 for symptomatic MVD, and $ 1, 755 for asymptomatic MVD. When aggregated to the US population, heart-valve disease accounted for an incremental annual cost of $ 23. 4 billion. The largest aggregate annual costs were incurred by patients with symptomatic MVD ($ 7. 6 billion), followed by symptomatic AVD ($ 5. 6 billion), asymptomatic MVD ($ 5. 6 billion), and asymptomatic AVD ($ 4. 6 billion). Conclusion: The annualized incremental costs of heart-valve disease were substantial for all groups examined, and greatest for patients with symptomatic MVD. This reflects the relatively high prevalence associated with this group. With a growing and aging population, the prevalence of heart-valve disease is expected to rise, increasing the burden on public health.

40|$|The {{population}} of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid fever, exhibits limited DNA sequence variation, which complicates efforts to rationally discriminate individual isolates. Here we utilize data from whole-genome sequences (WGS) of nearly 2, 000 isolates sourced from over 60 countries {{to generate a}} robust genotyping scheme that is phylogenetically informative and compatible {{with a range of}} assays. These data show that, {{with the exception of the}} rapidly disseminating H 58 subclade (now designated genotype <b>4.</b> 3. <b>1),</b> the <b>global</b> S. Typhi population is highly structured and includes dozens of subclades that display geographical restriction. The genotyping approach presented here can be used to interrogate local S. Typhi populations and help identify recent introductions of S. Typhi into new or previously endemic locations, providing information on their likely geographical source. This approach can be used to classify clinical isolates and provides a universal framework for further experimental investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{rule of law}} has {{historically}} been considered as an ideal of social ordering, and is increasingly invoked {{in relation to the}} international context. Doubts remain as to the meaning of the concept and as to its applicability to the international realm, the regulation of which is increasingly described in terms of a pluralistic and heterogeneous global governance. This PhD thesis shall first attempt to clarify the notion of rule of law in the global governance context. This clarified notion shall then be tested against real-life instances of global governance, namely in food safety standard-setting. The thesis shall conclude by delineating a normative framework for reflecting upon global governance from a rule of law perspective, and offer prospects as to the possible emergence of a global rule of law. Finally, it shall address practical recommendations to global governance actors as to how to promote a global rule of law. CONTENTS	IV ILLUSTRATIONS	VI ACKNOWLEDGMENTS	VII ABBREVIATIONS	IX I.

40|$|A {{search for}} a Higgs boson {{decaying}} into two photons in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV is reported. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5. 1 fb^- 1, recorded in 2011 at √(s) = 7 TeV and of 5. 3 fb^- 1, recorded in 2012 at √(s) = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The Higgs boson mass range explored is 110 [...] 150 GeV. Limits are set on the {{cross section of the}} Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to two photons. An excess of events above the expected background is observed for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 125 GeV, with a local significance of <b>4.</b> <b>1</b> σ. The <b>global</b> significance of observing such an excess anywhere in the search range is estimated to be 3. 2 σ. This result constitutes evidence for the existence of a new state that decays into two photons. A fit to this signal gives a mass of 125. <b>1</b> ± 0. <b>4</b> (stat) ± 0. 6 (syst) GeV.

However it offers more flexibility {{and is based on}} a more solid theoretical background. NEMOVAR, the global variational assimilation system for NEMO has been used operationally both at the Met Office and ECMWF for some time in its 3 D-Fgat formulation.

40|$|X, 221 p. ill. Op basis van een voorzichtige schatting zou ongeveer 1 % van de Belgische bevolking te kampen hebben met een ernstige, langdurige mentale aandoening. Het gaat om mensen die lijden aan schizofrenie, bipolaire stoornissen (ook manisch-depressieve stoornissen genoemd), steeds terugkomende ernstige depressies of persoonlijkheidsstoornissen. In België ligt de nadruk bij de zorg nog sterk op de opname in een psychiatrische instelling, hoewel er al andere begeleidingsmogelijkheden bestaan. Het Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg (KCE) pleit ervoor om deze mensen nog meer in de maatschappij te re-integreren, door zorg dichtbij of in de eigen leefomgeving te geven. Een multidisciplinair team, bestaande uit o. a. een psychiater, een psychiatrisch verpleegkundige, een sociaal assistent enz., zou in een aantal gevallen de zorg moeten coördineren. Verder is meer samenwerking tussen het federale en de regionale en gemeenschapsniveaus noodzakelijk. 1 INTRODUCTION AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 5 [...] 2 GENERAL BACKGROUND: DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY 7 [...] 2. 1 CHRONIC AND COMPLEX MENTAL DISORDERS: DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF THE [...] STUDY 7 [...] 2. 1. 1 Definition: Mental {{disorder}} 7 [...] 2. 1. 2 Definition: Chronic or severe and persistent {{mental disorders}} 8 [...] 2. 1. 3 Additional {{limitations of the}} scope of this study 8 [...] 2. 2 ORGANISATIONAL FORMS OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE: DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF THE [...] STUDY 9 [...] 2. 2. 1 Introduction 9 [...] 2. 2. 2 Definition: Mental health service 9 [...] 2. 2. 3 Typology of mental health services 9 [...] 2. 2. 4 Additional limitations {{of the scope of}} this study 12 [...] 2. 3 OUTCOME EVALUATION: GENERAL PERSPECTIVE 12 [...] 2. 4 EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND HEALTH CARE POLICY 13 [...] 3 LITERATURE REVIEW: METHODOLOGY 18 [...] 3. 1 INTRODUCTION 18 [...] 3. 1. 1 European Service Mapping Schedule (ESMS) 18 [...] 3. 1. 2 Types of study to be included 18 [...] 3. 2 SEARCH STRATEGY, IN- AND EXCLUSIONCRITERIA 18 [...] 3. 2. 1 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CRD Database (CRD-reports, DARE, [...] HTA) 18 [...] 3. 2. 2 Medline (Ovid), PsycInfo, Embase. 19 [...] 4 LITERATURE REVIEW: RESULTS 21 [...] <b>4.</b> <b>1</b> DEFINITIONS 21 [...] 4. 2 MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, RESIDENTIAL, NON-HOSPITAL 28 [...] <b>4.</b> 2. <b>1</b> Mental Health Services, Residential, Acute, Non-hospital. 28 [...] 4. 2. 2 Mental Health Services, Residential, Non-acute, Non-hospital, Indefinite stay (Daily [...] support, 24 h-support, Lower than daily support). 29 [...] 4. 2. 3 Mental Health Services, Residential, Non-acute, Non-hospital, Time limited stay. 32 [...] 4. 3 MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, OUT-PATIENT AND COMMUNITY 33 [...] <b>4.</b> 3. <b>1</b> Mental Health Services, Out-patient and community, Emergency care (mobile/ nonmobile).
