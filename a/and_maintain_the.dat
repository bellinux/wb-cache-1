5|$|A 2001 {{proposal}} envisaged three routes, lines 1, 2 and 3. The {{first was}} a circular route around the northern suburbs, {{and the others were}} radial routes to Newbridge in the west and Newcraighall in the south. All lines would have passed through the city centre. In May 2004, a 15-year operating contract was awarded to Transdev, to operate <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> tram network. This contract was cancelled in 2009.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 23/24 September, Allenby's General Headquarters (GHQ) {{instructed}} Chaytor's Force to continue harassment of the Fourth Army, cut off their retreat north from Amman, gain touch with the Arab Army, <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> detachment guarding the Jisr ed Damieh bridge.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, the CAF {{added two}} more corporations.

5|$|Ending {{the series}} of {{unsuccessful}} ceasefires, the UN deployed a protection force in Serbian-held Croatia—the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)—to supervise <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> agreement. The UNPROFOR was officially created by UN Security Council Resolution 743 on February 21, 1992.|$|E
5|$|H.B. 392 (Ch. 49), which {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} a county high school for Hampshire County and authorized the Hampshire County Board of Education to impose a levy not to exceed 30 cents for three years to construct <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> high school.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and a ceasefire called. After a series of {{unsuccessful}} ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated.|$|E

5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 14th century, these {{religious}} {{houses were}} regarded by City traders as interlopers — occupying what had previously been public open space nearby one of the City gates. On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse, eventually demolishing its buildings. By 1405, a stout wall was built to protect the property <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> privacy of the Order, particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative {{brood care}} (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle {{to do so is}} the weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of tunnels, in the heartwood of Eucalyptus trees. It is one of more than 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> fungal growth, probably never reproducing. Cooperative brood care is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested faeces of the adults.|$|E
5|$|Gan also {{founded a}} school for the poor {{in the village of}} Sam-toh in Fujian, China, where his forefathers were born, and helped to finance <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> Tranquerah Chinese Free School in Melaka. He also enabled young men of promise to realise their {{potential}} by paying for their university education. An example was the case of Wee Theam Tew, who gave up a clerical post with Macalister & Co. and proceeded to England to further his studies in law and qualify for the Bar in 1911.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and {{fighting}} {{between the two sides}} paused.

The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated, but Serbia continued to support the RSK. HV advances restored small areas to Croatian controlas the siege of Dubrovnik was lifted, and in Operation Maslenica. Croatian towns and villages were intermittently attacked by artillery, or missiles.|$|E

After a series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> agreement. A stalemate developed as the conflict evolved into static trench warfare, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. Serbia continued to support the RSK, but a series of HV advances restored small areas to Croatian control as the siege of Dubrovnik was lifted, and Operation Maslenica resulted in minor tactical gains. In response to the HV successes, the RSK intermittently attacked a number of Croatian towns and villages with artillery and missiles.|$|E

5|$|On 7 December 1991, another ceasefire {{was agreed}} and the JNA force besieging Dubrovnik became largely inactive.

The only exception was the Dubrovnik area, where the JNA attacked westward from Dubrovačko Primorje, pushing back elements of the HV's 114th and 116th Infantry Brigades and reaching the outskirts of Ston {{by the beginning of}} 1992.|$|E

5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs to set up <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive {{more information about the}} setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E
5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E
5|$|Running {{parallel}} to the main high street is a leat with a public footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (Upper, Middle and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but {{the south end of}} the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat is no longer in use for powering mills and the Environment Agency is not interested in managing the leat nor keeping it flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> Leat in 2005.|$|E
