He successfully negotiated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland and won a substantial reduction in foreign debts.|$|E
5|$|According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian {{economy in}} 2017 was {{nominally}} worth US$2.454 trillion; {{it is the}} sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$9.489 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP. With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% {{over the past two}} decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–12, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then it has slowly moved towards <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. India {{has been a member of}} WTO since 1 January 1995.|$|E

5000|$|Spencer MacCallum {{writes that}} E.C.

[...] He notes that: [...] "Riegel conceived of money as simply number accountancy among private traders. ... Riegel came {{down on the side}} of <b>a</b> rigorously <b>free-market</b> fiat system; for a mature exchange system as he conceived it would depend on no intrinsic value at all, nor would it require or tolerate any government participation. In that sense, the fully evolved exchange system would be a natural system operating entirely as <b>a</b> spontaneous, <b>free-market</b> process with no political mandates imposed." ...|$|R
25|$|During his term, Netanyahu {{also began}} {{a process of}} {{economic}} liberalization, taking steps towards <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> economy. Under his watch, the government began selling its shares in banks and major state-run companies. Netanyahu also greatly eased Israel's strict foreign exchange controls, enabling Israelis to take an unrestricted amount of {{money out of the}} country, open foreign bank accounts, hold foreign currency, and invest freely in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Manley's {{second term}} focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with {{the pursuit of}} <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> {{programme}} that stood {{in marked contrast to}} the interventionist economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of liberalisation. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.|$|E

25|$|Just {{days after}} the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin resolved to embark on a program of radical economic reform. Unlike Gorbachev's reforms, which sought to expand democracy in the socialist system, the new regime aimed to completely dismantle socialism and fully implement capitalism—converting the world's largest command economy into <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> one. During early discussions of this transition, Yeltsin's advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of J. R. Jayawardene swept {{to power in}} 1977, defeating the largely unpopular United Front government. Jayawardene introduced a new constitution, together with <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> economy and a powerful executive presidency modelled after that of France. It made Sri Lanka the first South Asian country to liberalise its economy. Beginning in 1983, ethnic tensions were manifested in an on-and-off insurgency against the government by the LTTE. An LTTE attack on 13 soldiers resulted in the anti-Tamil race riots in July 1983, allegedly backed by Sinhalese hard-line ministers, which resulted in more than 150,000 Tamil civilians fleeing the island, seeking asylum in other countries.|$|E

After being elected to the Cantonal Council of Zürich in 1975, Blocher {{was elected to the}} Swiss National Council and represented the canton of Zürich there from 25 November 1979 until his election to the federal council on 12 December 2003 as a deputy of the Swiss People's Party (Schweizerische Volkspartei/Union démocratique du centre; SVP/UDC), and then again from 4 December 2011 to 30 May 2014.|$|E

25|$|In response, the Narasimha Rao government, {{including}} Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, initiated {{economic reforms}} in 1991. The reforms {{did away with}} the Licence Raj, reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors. Since then, the overall thrust of liberalisation has remained the same, although no government has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as trade unions and farmers, on contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. By {{the turn of the}} 21st century, India had progressed towards <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> economy, with a substantial reduction in state control of the economy and increased financial liberalisation. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates and food security, although urban residents have benefited more than rural residents.|$|E
500|$|As <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> environmentalist, {{he asserts}} private {{property}} rights in relation to environmental protection and pollution prevention.

[...] He acknowledges there is clear evidence of rising temperatures {{in some parts of the}} globe, but says that temperatures are cooling in other parts.|$|E
500|$|As {{mayor of}} Newark, New Jersey, he [...] "drew {{criticism}} from liberal allies for embracing charter schools and voucher programs advocated by libertarians." [...] "He also championed “enterprise zones,” <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> approach to solving urban blight credited {{to the late}} Jack Kemp, a hard-core supply-sider and occasional Republican presidential contender who helped raise money for Booker’s first mayoral campaign." [...] Besides social media advances, Booker {{wants to see the}} rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. “We’re not moving at the speed of innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries are leaving the U.S. to work on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs. Booker supports abortion rights and affirmative action.|$|E

2500|$|Edwin Chadwick, a major {{contributor}} to the Commission's report, developed Jeremy Bentham's theory of utilitarianism, the idea that the success of something could be measured by whether it secured the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. This idea of utilitarianism underpinned the Poor Law Amendment Act. Bentham believed that [...] "the greatest good for the greatest number" [...] could only be achieved when wages found their true levels in <b>a</b> <b>free-market</b> system. Chadwick believed that the poor rate would reach its [...] "correct" [...] level when the workhouse was seen as a deterrent and fewer people claimed relief. A central authority was needed to ensure a uniform poor law regime for all parishes and to ensure that that regime deterred applications for relief; that is, to ensure a free market for labour required greater state intervention in poor relief.|$|E
