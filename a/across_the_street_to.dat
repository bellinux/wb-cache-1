60|$|From {{the upper}} {{batteries}} on the Rock, a complete view was obtainable {{of all the}} enemy's operations and, as they were seen to be raising mortar batteries, preparations were made to diminish {{the effects of a}} bombardment of the town. For this purpose the pavement of <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> was removed, and the ground ploughed up; the towers and most conspicuous buildings taken down; and traverses carried <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>to</b> permit communications to be carried on.|$|R
25|$|LCI is {{a maze of}} {{hallways}} {{that you}} will inevitably get lost in forever and you could probably find hell. The school building is land-locked and bounded by surrounding buildings.

25|$|Walker Branch Library, {{original}} {{building at}} 2901 Hennepin Ave. S.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, {{television}} manufacturer Philco complained to NBC that staging Today in a studio explicitly called the RCA Exhibition Hall was unfair (RCA owned NBC at the time).

25|$|Let us {{say that}} my wife, who {{is here in the}} gallery with us tonight, a sixth {{generation}} Oregonian, is walking by the friendly, local military base and is picked up as an unlawful enemy combatant. What is her recourse? She says, I am a U.S. citizen. That is a jurisdictional fact under this statute, and she will not have recourse to the courts?

25|$|Alone, Nancy puts Marge to bed {{and asks}} Don, who is <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>to</b> break into the house in twenty minutes.

25|$|Local transit buses {{running into}} and out of the city use a {{facility}} owned and operated by Peter Pan Bus Lines, which is headquartered in Springfield at the corner of Main and Liberty Streets, next to the Gothic arch that denotes entrance into Metro Center Springfield. As of 2011, Peter Pan's Bus Terminal is need of a major aesthetic overhaul– the opportunity for Peter Pan, Greyhound, and the PVTA to move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> Springfield's Unions Station intermodal facility should render the point moot. Plans call for a bus station to be built on the plot adjacent to Union Station– the site of the former Hotel Charles– with a 23-bay bus terminal on lower levels and a 400-space public parking lot on upper levels.|$|E

5000|$|The next morning, Seymour {{proceeded}} down Macao Reach {{where he}} met the Barracouta. The Dutch Folly Fort opposite the factories and Bird's Nest Fort were taken quiet possession of, as were afterwards the two Shameen Forts commanding the passage. The captured guns were rendered unserviceable. A detachment of Royal Marines was landed to protect the factories, later reinforced by another party and some bluejackets (sailors). Advanced posts and field guns were stationed at the most important points, and barricades placed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>to</b> guard against a surprise attack. On 25 October, Chinese forces attacked the pickets but were repulsed by the Marines {{with a loss of}} 14 Chinese killed and wounded.

25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door. He removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He walked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Tea Room {{was opened}} in 1927, by {{former members of}} the Russian Imperial Ballet, as a {{gathering}} place for Russian expatriates, and became famous as a gathering place for those in the entertainment industry.

Pupke, a tea and coffee merchant, whose son later moved the large clan to Long Island, seeking a more relaxed lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|After {{dropping}} game one, the Drillers {{found themselves}} {{not only with}} a bit more pressure on them for the rematch, but also without a home. As the Drillers gave up Skyreach Centre so that Shania Twain could add an Edmonton date to her tour. This forced the game to be moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> the much smaller Northlands Agricom (now Edmonton Expo Centre). After getting behind early, the change of scenery didn’t hurt the team {{in the long run}} though, as they posted 19–15 come from behind victory in front of an overflow crowd. The win gave the team a 23–17 record, and clinched the division and conference titles. This would also be the only home game during the Drillers four years and change that was not played at Edmonton Coliseum/Skyreach Centre, as well as the club's only conference title.|$|E

40|$|The {{courthouse}} {{square of}} our town is always crowded on summer Saturday nights. Cars are wedged neatly around the four {{sides of the}} square in every available parking place, the shops and groceries are ablaze with lights, and horns honk wildly as little children dash <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>to</b> join their friends in playing tag on the courthouse lawn. As one makes one 2 ̆ 7 s way through the crowd, women with bundles of all sizes and shapes and grocery bags with celery peeping out of the tops jostle one from all sides. Farmers dressed in faded overalls and toddlers licking ice cream cones bump elbows with girls in too short skirts and soldiers in from the nearby camp. Everyone seems in a great hurry to go nowhere, except the teen-age boys and girls, whose destination is well-known...|$|R
