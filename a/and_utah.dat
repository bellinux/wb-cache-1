5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt Lake <b>and</b> <b>Utah</b> {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the Salt Lake <b>and</b> <b>Utah,</b> while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the Salt Lake <b>and</b> <b>Utah</b> line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E

5|$|The first {{boundary}} {{which would}} {{become part of}} the monument was set as part of the Compromise of 1850, which created the New Mexico Territory <b>and</b> <b>Utah</b> Territory. The border between the two territories was congressionally defined as the 37th parallel north by the 31st United States Congress. In 1861, the 36th United States Congress transferred land previously allocated to the Utah Territory, to the newly created Colorado Territory. The Colorado Territory's southern border would remain as the 37th parallel north, but a new border—between the Colorado <b>and</b> <b>Utah</b> Territories—was declared to be the 32nd meridian west from Washington. This line was derived from the reference used at the time, the Washington meridian.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} the greater {{presence}} of cold-blooded (ectothermic) reptiles in warmer climates, {{the states in the}} southern half of the United States have more commonly designated a state reptile.

5|$|Between February and March, {{the corps}} participated in Operation Killer, pushing Chinese forces {{north of the}} Han River.

5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like.

Although {{it has been argued}} that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E
