25|$|Note {{that on the}} {{interval}} AB there is an odd number of borders colored 1-2 (simply because A is colored 1, B is colored 2; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> move along AB, {{there must be an}} odd number of color changes in order to get different colors at the beginning and at the end). Therefore, the vertex of G corresponding to the outer area has an odd degree. But it is known (the handshaking lemma) that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices with odd degree. Therefore, the remaining graph, excluding the outer area, has an odd number of vertices with odd degree corresponding to members of T.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general flow diagram where the topological sectors are {{represented}} by attractive fixed points. When scaling the effective system to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can see in the flow diagram on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a quantized value. If we started with a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the flow diagram, we see fixed points that are repulsive {{in the direction of the}} Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.|$|E

500|$|Instead of {{selecting}} from the numerous, basic backing tracks Sadler had collected before the sessions, Chuck D wanted {{for the production}} team to improvise beats in the studio. This led to much of Fear of a Black Planets music being composed on the spot. Chuck D said he spent numerous hours listening to various tapes, music records, and other audio sources in search of samples for the album. Of their search for samples, Hank Shocklee said, [...] "When you’re talking {{about the kind of}} sampling that Public Enemy did, we had to comb through thousands of records to come up with maybe five good pieces. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> started putting together those pieces, the sound got a lot more dense." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1921, strikes {{erupted in}} Petrograd when workers {{took to the}} streets {{demanding}} better food rations and more union autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: [...] "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." [...] The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. [...] "More and more", she wrote, [...] "we {{have come to the conclusion}} that we can do nothing here. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer we have decided to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

Howard Meltzer, Jane Goldenring, and Ted Bauman served as the film's executive producers; Randolph Cheveldave was its producer. Production was handled by GBO Films. The film's music was edited by James Hazell, and Mahlon Todd Williams was its cinematographer. Growing the Big One was promoted as part of Hallmark's collection of original, holiday movies. It was one of twenty-four films scheduled for broadcast on the Hallmark Channel and its affiliate digital cable and satellite television channel Hallmark Movies & Mysteries for the 2010–11 television season. While discussing the reasons behind the scheduling decisions, Barbara Fisher, the {{senior vice president of}} Hallmark Channel's programming, said: [...] "Original movies will continue to be the centerpiece of our prime time schedule as we broaden our entire programming mix <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> transition our daytime to home and lifestyle-oriented programming." ...|$|E
500|$|... "…Baby One More Time" [...] {{has been}} covered on {{numerous}} occasions.

The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, [...] "Turn". Lead singer Francis Healey said, [...] "We did it for a laugh the first time.

[...] The Guardian said this cover showed {{a new and more}} [...] "dark" [...] side of the band, commenting [...] "slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet [...] "This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time" [...] sounded". PopWreckoning.com called it [...] "perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame". Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, [...] "It was so weird.

500|$|Plutarch’s Life of Pericles, 13.4–9, {{informs us}} “the man who {{directed}} all the projects and was overseer [...] for him [...] was Phidias... Almost everything was under his supervision, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have said, {{he was in}} charge, owing to his friendship with Perikles, {{of all the other}} artists”. The description was not architekton, the term usually given to the creative influence behind a building project, rather episkopos. But it is from this claim, the circumstantial evidence of Phidias’s known work on the Athena Parthenos and his central role in the Periclean building programme that he is attributed authorship of the frieze. The frieze consists of 378 figures and 245 animals. It was 160 meters (524ft) in length when complete, as well as 1 meter in height, and it projects 5.6cm forward at its maximum depth. It is composed of 114 blocks of an average 1.22 meters in length, depicting two parallel files in procession. It was a particular novelty of the Parthenon that the cella carries an Ionic frieze over the hexastyle pronaos rather than Doric metopes, as would have been expected of a Doric temple. Judging by the existence of regulae and guttae below the frieze on the east wall this was an innovation introduced late in the building process and replaced the ten metopes and triglyphs that might otherwise have been placed there.|$|E

But Rachel's eye-on-the-prize, I'll-get-what-I-want attitude coupled with her inappropriate crush on the teacher just made her creepier than usual. Infiltrating his home, cooking and cleaning for him right under his crazy wife's nose. Come on, Berry, you're better than that..." [...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal commented on the episode [...] "Preggers", [...] "Rachel has become insufferable. The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bonafide triple-threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna {{to the rest of}} Glee." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN agreed, [...] "It's hard not to be annoyed by Rachel". James Poniewozik of Time has suggested that Rachel's negative character traits may actually be an asset, commenting on her performance of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] in the episode [...] "Sectionals", [...] "The number reminded me how much I like what the show's done with Rachel: she's a lead character, yet the show allows her to be annoying—but at the same time, her dedication makes her likeable. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> see here, as much of a pill as she can be, her ability to whip out a performance she's been working on since age four is an asset." ...|$|E
500|$|In an August 2008 {{interview}} with AbsolutePunk, McKinnon said the band {{were planning to}} start recording once the tour with New Found Glory had finished, [...] "So Oct & Nov." [...] McKinnon said that having Wade, who had previously worked on the band's other albums, on production duties, was {{a way for the}} album to have [...] "A Day To Remember-type feel". Wade also recorded the band's demos for the album, {{in the back of a}} bus. The album itself was recorded at Wade's The Wade Studio, in Ocala, Florida, after the Easycore Tour had finished. Gilbert was touring with New Found Glory in Europe at the time, but with video conferencing he was able to offer input about the record. In September 2008, a demo appeared on the band's MySpace page, entitled [...] "Wax Larry". [...] Documenting the recording process, the band released several webisodes on YouTube, under the name The Real ADTR: Homesick in Ocala, which had been called a spoof of The Real World. The webisodes were aided by director Drew Russ, as guitarist Neil Westfall states: [...] "When he [...] was telling us in the beginning that he was getting into video stuff, and we were like 'Well that's kinda crazy 'cause we need a video guy to do these webisodes for us'. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> started talking he really kinda got our sense of humor". While in the middle of recording Homesick, A Day to Remember released Old Record.|$|E
