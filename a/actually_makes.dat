5|$|Since HD 28185 b orbits in its star's {{habitable}} zone, {{some have}} speculated {{on the possibility}} of life on worlds in the HD 28185 system. While it is unknown whether gas giants can support life, simulations of tidal interactions suggest that HD 28185 b could harbor Earth-mass satellites in orbit around it for many billions of years. Such moons, if they exist, may be able to provide a habitable environment, though it is unclear whether such satellites would form in the first place. Additionally, a small planet in one of the gas giant's Trojan points could survive in a habitable orbit for long periods. The high mass of HD 28185 b, of over six Jupiter masses, <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> either of these scenarios more likely than if the planet was about Jupiter's mass or less.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they have}} {{effective}} stingers, these wasps {{and other members}} of Stenogastrinae are typically passive aggressive. Their stings are less painful for humans than those of many other social wasps, and often when faced with a large threat, these wasps will simply fall passively out of their nests. This behavior <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> it harder for the potential predator to determine the location of the nest.|$|E

25|$|Actuarial science, of {{the kind}} used to project the future {{solvency}} of social security, is by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections {{that turned out to}} be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might be much better or much worse than predicted.|$|E

25|$|An {{anastomosis}} is {{a surgical}} {{connection between the}} stomach and bowel, or between {{two parts of the}} bowel. The surgeon attempts to create a water-tight connection by connecting the two organs with either staples or sutures, either of which <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> a hole in the bowel wall. The surgeon will rely on the body's natural healing abilities and its ability to create a seal, like a self-sealing tire, to succeed with the surgery. If that seal fails to form for any reason, fluid from within the gastrointestinal tract can leak into the sterile abdominal cavity and give rise to infection and abscess formation. Leakage of an anastomosis can occur in about 2% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and less than 1% in mini gastric bypass. Leaks usually occur at the stomach-intestine connection (gastro-jejunostomy). There is a change in the drain fluid contents from serous (before the leak) to fecal/bilious (after the leak). Usually significant leaks need urgent re-operation. Sometimes a minor leakage can be treated with antibiotics only. It is usually safer to re-operate if an infection cannot be definitely controlled immediately.|$|E

The balloon trip is hysterical, and the attempts to explain their behaviour to a very worldly-wise Bart and Lisa are magnificent." ...|$|E

[...] Futterman {{called it a}} [...] "fierce match", and added the mash-up was well crafted. Hankinson rated it the second best performance of the episode. Brian Moyler of Gawker, who writes of his dislike of mash-ups, characterized it as [...] "the only mash-up of the night that <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> sense" [...] but he called it an [...] "awful aural clash" [...] and [...] "the second least dreadful".|$|E
500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident.

One time I did change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to see if anyone noticed." [...] Dennis revealed in May 2011, that he wears a brace on his leg as remembering which leg to limp on was becoming a [...] "little distracting." ...|$|E
500|$|The game itself {{includes}} a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs {{during the most}} violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed {{it was the first}} CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: [...] "There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line." [...] But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was [...] "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" [...] and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, [...] "the censorship option <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are".|$|E

500|$|At Fox's request, {{the writers}} {{developed}} a musical episode, [...] "Brown Betty" [...] {{to fit into}} the network's [...] "Fox rocks" [...] campaign in the same vein as its series Glee. While the episode already had most of the necessary elements in place before Fox's request, the producers were able to add the musical theme as a [...] "narrative device" [...] to [...] "explore Walter's feelings" [...] in the aftermath of Peter's discovery and flight. To prepare for the season finale, the producers began developing characteristics of the parallel universe relatively early on. Relating to the two universes' idiosyncrasies, Pinkner and Wyman were both interested in world building and [...] "the concept of choices", such as the differing events that led to the Other Side possessing a still-standing World Trade Center but destroyed White House. Other historical idiosyncrasies included the oxidation of the Statue of Liberty and the use of zeppelins as transportation. They believed that all of their additions were [...] "the texture that <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real".|$|E
500|$|A Hollywood executive, not {{involved}} with the film, felt it succeeded because it [...] "has a self-deprecating tone that’s riotous. It’s never been done before. It’s poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; can you imagine them making fun of themselves in a movie?" [...] James Gunn, director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, refuted this and said Deadpool was a success because [...] "it’s original, it’s damn good ... and it wasn’t afraid to take risks". Gunn hoped studios would learn [...] "the right lesson" [...] from the film and not just try to make more films [...] "like Deadpool". After Fox's Logan (2017) also became a success, Forbes Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was [...] "appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes", but [...] "too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> these movies work". Graeme McMillan at The Hollywood Reporter concurred, adding, [...] "Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?" ...|$|E

[...] GameSpot praised the game's story {{and said that the}} voice acting and music is [...] "great" [...] and that the game can [...] "also be funny," [...] but stated that the game is [...] "quite thin in both action and adventure" [...] and also criticised certain elements of the gameplay. [...] "Those who want action instead of fiction will find the game somewhat dull, but those who appreciate an original story and great atmosphere will find In Cold Blood to be a satisfying blend of espionage and science fiction."

500|$|... "Devil in a New Dress" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} on September 3, 2010, {{and was the}} fourth song to be featured apart of Kanye West's GOOD Fridays, a music giveaway that provided free MP3 downloads every week. The intention was to release a free new song every Friday for a few months, and the weekly tracks generally featured various rappers from his label, GOOD Music, and other artists he usually collaborated with. Though {{it was the fourth}} GOOD Fridays song released, it was the second completely original track premiered. During its initial release, Consequence of Sound reported, [...] "the Chicago based rapper has shared Devil in a New Dress', a song which is rumored to be included on West’s still untitled fifth studio album. Compared to his other recent joints, the track is rather minimal in nature. It clocks in at less than three minutes and features no guest contributors. In fact, it’s the accompanying beat which <b>actually</b> <b>makes</b> the post-midnight release worth our time." [...] The song was often rumored to be featured on West's new album, appearing on a leaked track list. It was later confirmed to appear on the album, albeit as a vastly different version. It was released digitally following the release of the album.|$|E

[...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Jane Clifford felt that it could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, remarking that [...] "if as a kid you ever drew eyes or a mouth on your hand and then 'talked' to a friend, you'll relate to this show." [...] Oppositely, Rebecca Brayton of WatchMojo.com felt that while Oobi [...] "had the intentions to build academic skills in children ... it left their parents empty-handed." [...] Evan Levine of The Star Democrat stated in his review that [...] "it is certainly fun for preschoolers {{to be able to make}} their own Oobis, and they’ll no doubt relate to some of the issues discussed … parents, however, may find that the show wears thin quickly and feels a little forced." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Confessions Tour, [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was {{performed}} with Madonna {{dressed in a}} purple and white leotard, designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier.
