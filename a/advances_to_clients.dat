40|$|Persistent food {{insecurity}} accompanied by low and declining farm household incomes {{are a common}} feature of many small holder maize and bean producers in western Kenya. This has been largely attributed to soil nutrient depletion, among other factors. One way of addressing soil fertility problems in many maize-based cropping systems {{is the use of}} agro-forestry based technologies. We carried out a survey in western Kenya (Vihiga and Siaya districts) aimed at analyzing the financial and social profitability of use of agroforestry based (improved tree fallows) and other soil fertility management technologies among smallholder farmers. The Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) was used to determine the financial and social profitability of different production systems, which were categorized {{on the basis of the}} technology used to address soil fertility. Farm budgets were first prepared and in turn used to construct the PAMs for six production systems namely: maize bean intercrop without any soil fertility management inputs; maize bean intercrop with chemical fertilizers only; maize bean intercrop with a combination of chemical fertilizers and improved fallows; maize bean intercrop with improved fallows only; maize bean intercrop with a combination of improved fallows and rock phosphate; and maize bean intercrop with Farm Yard Manure (FYM) only. Results revealed that use of chemical fertilizers with improved fallows was the most profitable technology and thus the study recommended that farmers be encouraged to intensify the use of chemical fertilizers. To make chemical fertilizers more accessible to farmers, the study also recommended that good linkages be made between farmers and micro credit institutions so that small scale farmers are not actually biased against due to lack of collateral when credit is being <b>advanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>clients.</b> Peer-reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Rather than {{offering}} {{financial advice}} and maximizing his clients' income, {{as a business}} manager normally would, Klein set up what he called [...] "buy/sell agreements" [...] where a company owned by Klein became an intermediary between his client and the record label, owning {{the rights to the}} music, manufacturing the records, selling them to the record label, and paying royalties and cash <b>advances</b> <b>to</b> the <b>client.</b> Although Klein greatly increased his clients' incomes he also enriched himself, sometimes without his clients' knowledge (the Rolling Stones $1.25M advance from Decca in 1965 was deposited into a company that Klein set up and the fine print of the contract didn't require Klein to release it for 20 years). Klein's involvement with both the Beatles and Rolling Stones would lead to years of litigation and, specifically for the Rolling Stones, accusations from the group that Klein had withheld royalty payments, stole the publishing rights to their songs, and neglected to pay their taxes for five years (necessitating their French [...] "exile" [...] in 1971).|$|R

This paper focuses on the professional responsibilities defence lawyers bear in sexual assault cases. Its central claim is as follows: Defence counsel are ethically obligated to restrict their carriage of a sexual assault case (including the evidence they seek to admit, the lines of examination and cross-examination they pursue and the closing arguments they submit) to conduct that supports finding of facts within the bounds of law. Put another way, defence counsel are ethically precluded from using strategies and advancing arguments that rely for their probative value on three social assumptions about sexual violence that have been legally rejected as baseless and irrelevant...|$|R
