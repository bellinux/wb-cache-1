5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System.

By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities <b>and</b> <b>suburbs.</b>|$|E
