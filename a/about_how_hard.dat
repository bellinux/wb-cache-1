500|$|With some hesitation, {{both men}} {{agree to the}} match, {{creating}} a media buzz that stabs at Rocky's has-been status and Dixon's credibility. Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice; that to succeed in life, [...] "it ain't <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> you hit; it's <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> you can get hit, and keep moving forward", and that blaming others won't help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky's side. Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed's old trainer, Duke, who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible.|$|E

[...] Greenwalt observed that the show raises questions about what it means to be a man and does this not only through the characterization of Angel but also the men around him. He said that like other male characters, taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy, but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity. Greenwalt also compared Connor's journey with others in terms of identity, which he considers a poignant theme within the series. He found it ironic that Connor who was [...] "initially the most damaged of all the characters", was the only one able to [...] "reconcile his actions and new man existence together" [...] and be at peace with himself in the end.|$|E

2500|$|According to Badu, the album's closing track, [...] "Out My Mind, Just in Time", is a three-{{movement}} song: [...] "The first {{movement is}} called 'Recovering Undercover Over-lover.'

It's typical of how you feel in relationships. The second movement is called ... 'Easier Said Than Done,' and it's <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it is to change after you've been in a relationship for so long. And then the third movement is called 'But Not This Time,' because even though I've done things a certain way for so long, I won't do that this time". Andy Kellman of AllMusic described the song as being innocently as a piano ballad, before changing into a [...] "psychedelic, slow-motion soul-jazz" [...] song that sees Badu becoming [...] "increasingly fragmentary and tripped-out" [...] before being [...] "renewed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The attack {{occurred}} on Hitler's birthday, {{which led to}} speculation in the media. Some people, such as Robyn Anderson, who knew the perpetrators, stated that the pair were not obsessed with Nazism nor did they worship or admire Hitler in any way. Anderson stated, in retrospect, {{that there were many}} things the pair did not tell friends. Dave Cullen, author of the 2009 book Columbine, cites evidence that Harris did revere the Nazis. He praised them often in his journal, and some of his friends grew irritated at his frequent Nazi salutes and quotations {{in the months leading up}} to the shooting. At a certain point, Harris realized he needed to reduce this behavior, for fear of revealing his plans. He commented in his journal <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it was to wait until April to express all his hatred for the human race. In his journal, Harris mentioned his admiration of what he imagined to be natural selection, and wrote that he would like to put everyone in a super Doom game and see to it that the weak die and the strong live. On the day of the massacre, Harris wore a white T-shirt with the words [...] "Natural selection" [...] printed in black.|$|E

A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. [...] "No," [...] he replied, [...] "I was talking about another time, another era." [...] In his autobiography An American Life, Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction they charted, his warm feelings for Gorbachev, and his concern for Gorbachev's safety because Gorbachev pushed reforms so hard.

40|$|Rational agents will {{discount}} {{information that}} they know comes from a biased source. This suggests that they cannot be swayed by reported information they know to be biased. However, the capacity for politically biased news organizations to mislead rational agents is restored if consumers are not sure <b>about</b> <b>how</b> much <b>hard</b> information the news organization has, {{and how much it}} may be concealing. We use this framework to contribute to the current debate on restrictions of ownership of media. Preliminary results suggest that ownership restrictions may not be needed if the owners of news channels have strong and diverse political motives quite different from the general citizenry- for then there would be no mergers contemplated. However, strong political motives that are not too dissimilar from those of the citizenry may lead to mergers that restrict the information divulged, and thus might be proscribed. If political motives are weak, then the merged entity will want to commit to impartial reporting, so that mergers are not harmful to information dissemination...|$|R

She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she'd {{wrenched}} her arm a day or two ago, and didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said [...] "Ouch!" [...] it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with.

And at last quite suddenly he said that there was something that he wanted to ask me if I wouldn't think it a liberty. My breath stopped and I couldn't speak, and then he went on to ask if he might lend us twenty-five dollars. He got very red in the face when he said it and he began counting out the money on the sofa, and somehow I hadn't expected that it was money and began to cry. But I told Mr. Peters that of course we couldn't think of taking any money, and I begged him to pick it up again and then I began to try to tell him <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it was to get along and to ask him to get work for Uncle William, but I started to cry again. Mr. Peters came over to my chair and took hold of the arm of it and told me not to cry. Somehow his touch on the arm of the chair thrilled all through me and though I knew that it was wrong I let him keep it there and even let him stroke the upholstery and I don't know just what would have happened but at that very minute Uncle William came in. He was most courteous to Mr. Peters and expressed his apologies for having been out and said that it must have been extremely depressing for Mr. Peters to find that he was not at home, and he thanked him for putting himself to the inconvenience of waiting. And a little while after that Mr. Peters left.|$|E
40|$|Design {{diversity}} is a protection against design faults causing common-mode failure in redundant systems. Although {{we know that}} it is effective, we badly lack knowledge <b>about</b> <b>how</b> much reliability it will buy in practice, and thus its cost-effectiveness, in which cases it is an appropriate solution and how it should be taken into account by safety assessor and regulators. Both current practice and the scientific debate about design diversity depend largely on intuition <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the little <b>hard</b> empirical knowledge available should be extrapolated. We show a way of making this activity more scientific by substituting a detailed probabilistic model for broad-brush intuition. Simple assumptions on the process of fault creation in two separately-developed versions yield interesting conclusions about two questions that are commonly debated: what degree of reliability improvement in a redundant system an assessor can reliably expect from diversity; and whether this reliability improvement increases or decreases with higher-quality development processes. For instance, we show how software reliability assessments based on current practice for single-version software should be consistently extended to assessing a 1 -out-of- 2, twoversion system. 1...|$|R

Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|R
