60|$|I was grievously puzzled at all this, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other tree, followed, as before, by Euphemia and Pomona.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{the train}} {{came to a}} halt, and they piled out, dress-suit cases in hand, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> automobile.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, the Hudson Bay agent came in <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Clarke.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} his back <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where Riggs sat nursing a bullet-burn on his leg.|$|R
60|$|He came out, smiling falsely at the crowd, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{where his}} balloon swayed in the air.|$|R
60|$|When he had finished, I {{paid him}} ten cents for his work, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place he had mentioned.|$|E
60|$|So old Granny Fox {{smoothed}} out her skirts <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{foot of the}} tree where Ol' Mistah Buzzard sat.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{help for}} it, {{and with an}} angry look on his face, Pepper left the {{gymnasium}} <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school building.|$|E
60|$|She rose, whilst Gerald {{was paying}} the bill, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Halliday's table. They all {{glanced up at}} her.|$|R
60|$|Not a great {{distance}} off was a spring of pure cold water, and presently {{one of the men}} got up <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> this to get a drink.|$|R
60|$|And then Billy McMahan {{conceived}} and accomplished the most startling and audacious act of his life. He rose deliberately <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Cortlandt Van Duyckink's table {{and held out}} his hand.|$|R
60|$|She paused {{with her}} breast heaving. He rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{fireplace}} and flicked his ashes into {{it before he}} spoke. His calmness maddened her.|$|E
60|$|Dave {{had been}} {{seated on the}} end of the piazza, but now he arose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other bungalow. Here he met Mrs. Wadsworth just coming from Jessie's room.|$|E
6000|$|The youth {{sank back}} again baffled by this all-inclosing acceptance. [...] "What {{do you intend}} to do to-day?" [...] he asked, as she rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little walnut table.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the closing}} scene of [...] "Charlotte's Web", a {{mourning}} Alex places flowers on her half-sister's fresh grave next <b>to</b> Jessica DiLaurentis' <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a black vehicle. Before stepping inside, her chauffeur expresses his condolences.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jerry gets up very deliberate, <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the parrot. [...] "Is this a menagerie?" [...] he says. [...] "Can't a man have supper {{in peace}} without an image like you {{starting}} to holler? Go to sleep." ...|$|R

60|$|Tik-Tok rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne, all the Kings and Queens making way for him. Then with clanking steps he {{mounted the}} {{platform}} {{and sat on the}} broad seat beside the Citizen.|$|E
6000|$|... "A wolf, perhaps," [...] {{said one}} of the Indians, in his native tongue, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bushes. His {{companion}} started to follow, when Captain Moore leaped upon him and bore him to the earth.|$|E
60|$|She was by {{no means}} easy in her mind. She loved Nostromo. She turned her eyes upon Giselle, sitting at a distance, with {{something}} of maternal tenderness, and the jealous anguish of a rival outraged in her defeat. Then she rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
5000|$|When Milo {{suspects}} that Morris has been drinking again, he asks Chloe to check Morris for {{any signs of}} alcohol.

[...] she responded by saying [...] "Just checking your breath." ...|$|R
6000|$|...

I've a perfect right to be supping with an old friend!'--would you do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonder {{what this}} is?" [...] he mused, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light {{to read the}} letter. It was written on a single sheet of paper, in lead pencil, and evidently in a {{disguised}} hand. It contained but a few lines, as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{six o'clock}} the two quitted the store {{together}} <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bowery. Pep was already waiting for Richard. He {{had a big}} bundle of evening papers under his arm, and seemed to have improved both his capital and his time.|$|E
60|$|Guy Frapley {{heard the}} racket, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spot from whence it proceeded. He was {{astonished}} beyond measure to see Dave leading off, {{yelling at the}} top of his lungs, and waving a rattle in one hand and the school colors in the other.|$|E
60|$|Having {{arranged}} {{everything as}} well as the means at hand permitted, the three Rover boys left the vicinity of the brushwood <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where the small cottage was located.

60|$|He {{glanced at}} Hal, <b>and</b> then <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where Allen {{sat at a}} desk, writing a letter.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the two of}} {{them seem}} {{oblivious}} to each other. Kaname turns around to see another woman <b>and</b> waves <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her. The woman turns out to be Kay herself. As the two disappear, it is revealed that Kaname was just a memory of when her and Kaname were together. She then <b>walks</b> away smiling <b>and</b> the video comes to an end.|$|R
60|$|This {{would never}} do. He {{deliberately}} placed the book face downward {{on the desk}} <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chair. With a swift sweep he sent both mask and glove hurtling under the bed, and so violently that he heard the mask rebound from the wall.|$|E
60|$|I {{was just}} locking {{the door of}} the carriage-house, when Pomona came running to me to tell me that the tramp wanted to see me about {{something}} very important--just a minute, he said. I put the key in my pocket <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tree. It was now almost dark, but I could see that the dog, the tramp, and the tree still kept their respective places.|$|E
60|$|Arms were outstretched with {{pointing}} fingers. Someone {{shouted out}} a long sentence of which not a word could be made out; and then the brig, having reached the western limit of the bank, began to move diagonally away, increasing her distance from the yacht but bringing her stern gradually into view. The people aft, Lingard noticed, left their places <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> taffrail so as to keep him longer in sight.|$|E
5000|$|It {{all starts}} out in Old City, Hyderabad. In an alley, Suri, Ajju Tehzab's {{right-hand}} man, is selling drugs to a [...] "party", in Mama's territory.

60|$|Weedon Scott {{smiled with}} a {{superior}} air, gained his feet, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> White Fang. He talked soothingly to him, {{but not for}} long, then slowly put out his hand, rested it on White Fang's head, and resumed the interrupted patting. White Fang endured it, keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously, not upon the man that patted him, but upon the man that stood in the doorway.|$|R
6000|$|Often {{during the}} days of this {{friendship}} Mr. Polly would leave his shop <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Rusper's establishment, and stand in his doorway and enquire: [...] "Well, O' Man, how's the Mind of the Age working?" [...] and get quite an hour of it, and sometimes Mr. Rusper would come into the outfitter's shop with [...] "Heard the (kik) latest?" [...] and {{spend the rest of}} the morning.|$|R
