5|$|In 1941, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} Germany Must Perish! which called for the sterilization of the German people {{and the distribution of}} the German lands. The text was used extensively in Nazi propaganda, often as a justification for the persecution of Jews and was specifically cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> round up the Jews of Hanover, Germany.|$|E
5|$|This {{same problem}} also was {{cited by the}} Nevada Legislature <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> {{dissolve}} Bullfrog County, Nevada, a short-lived county specially created in 1987 for purposes of shifting federal transfer payments related {{to the creation of}} the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility directly to the state treasury.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{extensive}} damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area {{made it impossible to}} use. With the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter in Baton Rouge. On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E

30|$|Concerning ECAs, intuitivity {{is often}} given <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> provide {{embodiment}} (Ruttkay et al. 2004). Therefore it is a relevant quality aspect for the topic 5 (cf. Section “Computers as social actors”).|$|R
5|$|Falling attendances {{due to the}} {{commercial}} nature of the district, and also a sense {{that there was some}} redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a public consultation, in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, at least in part because the former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> merge it into St John's.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E
5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, co-textual {{references}} and context are crucial when interpreting textese, {{and it is}} precisely this shortfall that critics cite <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> use it (although the English language in general, like many other languages, has many words that have different meanings in different contexts).|$|R
50|$|The XM was {{reviewed}} by numerous automotive magazines {{during the course}} of its life. These reviews were generally favorable, if inconsistent, particularly concerning the cars ride quality and appearance. Eventually, reviewers had set up a vicious circle where the car was criticized for not selling and this was offered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> buy one.|$|R
5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

50|$|Downtown Durham and {{public-private}} partnerships were a key focus for him.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Aponte dated an {{insurance}} salesman named Roberto Tamayo. Tamayo was accused by a Cuban intelligence defector of spying for the Cuban government. Tamayo was alternately said by a US intelligence source {{to be an}} FBI informant. Aponte's relationship with Tamayo, which ended in 1994, has been brought up by Republican Senator Jim DeMint <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> confirm her as ambassador to El Salvador in 2011.|$|R

25|$|Imam Shaafi’i {{reasoned}} that divine decree had already listed fear of committing injustice <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> not wed more than once, hence it was pointless {{for the same}} reason (for not wedding more than once) to be expounded twice in the same verse.|$|E
50|$|Although Clements {{recognized}} that vegetation follows gradients {{rather than being}} tightly bound, his rhetorical comparisons of ecological communities to organisms fostered the impression that communities, including the climax, have distinct edges in space and time. Yet Robert Whittakers research demonstrated plant species distribute themselves along nutrient and other environmental gradients. Many ecologists saw this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> stop using the climax concept.|$|R
50|$|The {{reduction}} on {{air travel}} demand {{caused by the}} attack is also seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> contributory <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> the retirement of the only supersonic aircraft in service at the time, Concorde. It have also been commented {{that the lack of}} demand for the Concorde after its service resumption in 2001 could be caused by the death of many regular Concorde travellers resulted from this attack.|$|R
50|$|Speed of {{response}} is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> use <b>an</b> outsourcer. {{if a company}} was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find and office and build a team. With an outsourcer, once selected often a full working team can be operational {{within a matter of}} days or weeks.|$|R
25|$|In 1895, Ethiopia {{abandoned}} its agreement to follow Italian foreign policy, and Italy used the renunciation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> invade Ethiopia. The Italian army failed {{on the battlefield}} of Adowa, despite having superior weaponry; the sheer large numbers of the Ethiopian warriors forced Italy eventually to retreat into Eritrea.|$|E
25|$|The {{words of}} Jesus on the cross, {{especially}} his last words, {{have been the}} subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ. The difference between the accounts is cited by James Dunn <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt their historicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the sweeter taste of the new flavor also ran contrary to previous Coke advertising, in which spokesman Bill Cosby had touted Coke's less-sweet taste <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> prefer it over Pepsi. Nevertheless, the company's stock went up on the announcement, and market research showed 80% of the American public {{was aware of the}} change within days.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such <b>as</b> with <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> expect that <b>a</b> person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|R

25|$|The {{exponential}} growth in computing technology suggested by Moore's Law is commonly cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> expect a singularity {{in the relatively}} near future, {{and a number of}} authors have proposed generalizations of Moore's Law.

25|$|According to {{the award-winning}} 2004 BBC {{documentary}} The Power of Nightmares, al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together {{that it was}} hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.|$|E
25|$|Because Firefox {{generally}} has fewer publicly known security vulnerabilities than Internet Explorer (see Comparison of web browsers), improved security {{is often cited}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox. The Washington Post reported that exploit code for known critical security vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer was available for 284 days in 2006. In comparison, exploit code for known, critical security vulnerabilities in Firefox was available for nine days before Mozilla issued a patch to remedy the problem.|$|E

50|$|It {{is clear}} that {{millions}} of tons of plastics are in the environment and a lot of countries do not have the capacity to recycle them. It is estimated that of the 300 million tons of plastic produced annually in the world only 3% is recycled. OXO offers an option for plastic in the environment which cannot realistically be collected, but should not be treated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> collect plastic if possible.|$|R
