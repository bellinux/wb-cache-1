5|$|Kawaguchi's Center Body of 3,000 troops {{began their}} attacks {{on a ridge}} south of Henderson Field {{beginning}} on 12 September in what was later called the Battle of Edson's Ridge. After numerous frontal assaults, Kawaguchi's attack was repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese, who retreated back into the jungle on 14 September. Oka's <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> {{the west and the}} Kuma Battalion's <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> the east were also repulsed by the U.S. Marines over the same two days. Kawaguchi's units were ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau Valley to join with Oka's unit {{on the west side of}} the Lunga Perimeter. Most of Kawaguchi's men reached the Matanikau by 20 September.|$|E

5000|$|Transgender {{people have}} {{higher levels of}} {{interaction}} with the police than the general population. 7% of transgender Americans have been held in prison cell simply due to their gender identity/expression. This rate is 41% for transgender African-Americans. [...] 16% of respondents had been sexually <b>assaulted</b> <b>in</b> prison, a risk factor for HIV. 20% of trans women are sexually <b>assaulted</b> <b>in</b> prison, compared to 6% of trans men. Trans women of color {{are more likely to be}} <b>assaulted</b> whilst <b>in</b> prison. 38% of black trans women report having been sexually <b>assaulted</b> <b>in</b> prison compared to 12% of white trans women.|$|R
5000|$|A {{report from}} the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) {{released}} in April 2015 showed a 26% reduction <b>in</b> <b>assaults</b> <b>in</b> the lockout area, and a 32% reduction <b>in</b> <b>assaults</b> <b>in</b> Kings Cross. In a March 2017 report, however, areas adjacent to the lockout precinct showed a 12% increase <b>in</b> <b>assaults,</b> with a 17% increase in [...] "easy-to-reach" [...] areas.|$|R
40|$|This project {{examined}} {{the characteristics of}} <b>assaults</b> <b>in</b> domestic violence incidents reported to the Alaska State Troopers. Assaults are only one type of criminal offense defined in Alaska statutes as a crime involving domestic violence. This report is not inclusive of all crimes involving domestic violence reported to AST, because it only includes <b>assaults.</b> <b>In</b> addition, this report is not inclusive of <b>assaults</b> <b>in</b> domestic violence incidents that were reported to municipal police departments across Alaska. Only <b>assaults</b> <b>in</b> domestic violence incidents reported to AST are described in this report. The term assault will be used throughout this report to define assault cases that are crimes involving domestic violence incidents; this includes felony and misdemeanor assaults. [...] The sample utilized for this analysis included all <b>assaults</b> <b>in</b> domestic violence incidents reported to AST in 2004. It included information from 1, 281 reports on 1, 803 assault charges, 1, 356 suspects, 1, 523 victims, and 1, 283 witnesses. This descriptive analysis documents the characteristics of these reports, charges, suspects, victims, witnesses, and legal resolutions...|$|R
5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention. His activities thereafter are unclear, {{but it is}} likely that he became an itinerant worker. In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed on alcohol.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1986, {{both women}} entered Alford pleas for the Salmonella attack {{and the other}} charges, and {{received}} sentences ranging from three to twenty years, to be served concurrently. Sheela received 20 years for the attempted murder of Rajneesh's physician, twenty years for first-degree <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> the poisoning of Judge Hulse, ten years for second-degree <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> the poisoning of Commissioner Matthews, {{four and a half}} years for her role in the attack, {{four and a half years}} for the wiretapping conspiracy, and five years' probation for immigration fraud; Puja received fifteen, fifteen, seven and a half, and four and a half years, respectively, for her role in the first four of these crimes, as well as three years' probation for the wiretapping conspiracy. Both Sheela and Puja were released on parole early for good behavior, after serving twenty-nine months of their sentences in a minimum-security federal prison. Sheela's Green Card was revoked; she moved to Switzerland. She remarried there and went on to run two nursing homes in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> 161 AD, {{defeating}} two Roman {{armies and}} invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD {{to counter the}} resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was {{burned to the ground}} by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.|$|E

5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual <b>assault,</b> <b>in</b> 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Another riot {{occurred}} in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N' Roses' appearance, Metallica's set {{was cut short}} after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree burns in a pyrotechnics accident. However, Guns N' Roses was unable to go on stage early, because Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. Nearly an hour into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage and <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> relation to the Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years' probation.|$|E
5|$|By 878 the Vikings {{had seized}} eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex, and Alfred {{was reduced to}} being a {{fugitive}} in the Somerset marshes, but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington. This {{was followed by a}} period of peace, and in the late 880s Alfred concluded a treaty with Guthrum, king of the East Anglian Vikings, setting the boundary between Wessex and English Mercia on the one hand, and the Danelaw on the other. A further Viking <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> the mid 890s was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Cascioferro {{never went}} to any school. When still young, Cascioferro married a teacher from Bisacquino, Brigida Giaccone, who {{instructed}} him {{how to read and}} write. He was inducted into the Mafia in the 1880s. He worked as a revenue collector as a young adult, using the position as a cover to carry out his protection racket. His criminal record began with an <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> 1884 and progressed through extortion, arson, and menacing, and eventually to the kidnapping of the 19-year-old Baroness Clorinda Peritelli di Valpetrosa in June 1898, for which he received a three-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned an <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> {{force against}} the four {{infantry}} battalions and two armoured regiments of the Polish 1st Armoured Division dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would {{attack from the}} north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from reinforcing the Polish armoured division. Having managed {{to break out of}} the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, {{media reports}} linked Brown {{with the role}} as the next {{managing}} director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Brown's successor and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, supported Brown for the role while the Prime Minister, David Cameron, voiced opposition to this. Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced. Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde – the eventual successful candidate – for the post.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Stuart {{was held}} in custody by Essex Police on {{suspicion}} of <b>assault,</b> <b>in</b> relation to an incident involving Chris Beardsley which resulted in Beardsley's jaw being broken in two places. The incident occurred during a match with York City on 22 September 2007. He was charged with grievous bodily harm in December 2007. He made a further 43 appearances for Grays during the season, failing to score. Following the departure of Stuart Thurgood to Gillingham in November 2007, Stuart was handed the captaincy {{for the remainder of}} the season, having previous served as vice-captain.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred {{too late in the}} evening to be covered in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi– due to press censorship– was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and {{the front page of the}} 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted.|$|E

5|$|On June 21, 2014, Solo {{was arrested}} and charged with two {{misdemeanor}} counts of <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> the fourth degree; one against her half-sister and the other against her nephew. She was booked under her married name of Hope Amelia Stevens. After pleading not guilty, she was released the following day. In August, her trial was scheduled for November 4, 2014, but this was later delayed until January 20, 2015. On December 30, 2014, the judge ordered more depositions from the defendants and delayed a decision on whether charges against Solo would be dropped until January 6, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German <b>assault</b> <b>in</b> their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced {{the next phase}} of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further <b>assault.</b> <b>In</b> the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.|$|E
