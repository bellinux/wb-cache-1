40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} metal-free applications using diaryliodonium salts. The first project describes an <b>arylation</b> protocol <b>of</b> allylic and benzylic alcohols in aqueous media. The method proceeds under mild conditions and the ether products were obtained in moderate to good yields. The methodology was also expanded to include <b>arylation</b> <b>of</b> phenols, giving diaryl ethers in good to excellent yields. In the second project, an arylation method that included a wider range <b>of</b> aliphatic <b>alcohols</b> was developed. The scope of accessible alkyl aryl ethers was studied and included a comparative study of phenylation and nitrophenylation <b>of</b> various <b>alcohols.</b> Finally, a formal metal-free synthesis of butoxycain was performed, illustrating {{the applicability of the}} developed method. The third project focused on the limitations and side reactions occurring in Chapter 2 and 3. First, an approach to access symmetric diaryl ethers via <b>arylation</b> <b>of</b> hydroxide was presented. This reaction gave rise to a number of side products, which we hypothesized to originate from aryne-type intermediates. A mechanism for the formation of these side products was suggested, supported by trapping and deuterium labeling experiments. Oxidation <b>of</b> the <b>alcohol</b> to the corresponding ketone was also observed and the mechanism of this interesting side reaction was investigated. The latter was suggested to proceed via an intramolecular oxidation without the involvement of radicals or arynes. The fourth project covers a method to synthesize highly sterically congested alkyl aryl ethers via <b>arylation</b> <b>of</b> tertiary <b>alcohols</b> using diaryliodonium salts. The method displayed a broad scope of tertiary alcohols and was also suitable for fluorinated alcohols. The final project detailed in this thesis deals with C-arylation with diaryliodonium salts, showcasing nitroalkanes as well as a nitro ester as suitable nucleophiles for metal-free arylation.   At the time of the doctoral defense, the following paper was unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{enantioselective}} Pd-catalyzed redox-relay Heck <b>arylation</b> <b>of</b> acyclic alkenyl <b>alcohols</b> allows {{access to}} various useful chiral building blocks from simple olefinic substrates. Mechanistically, {{after the initial}} migratory insertion, a succession of β-hydride elimination and migratory insertion steps yields a saturated carbonyl product instead of the more general Heck product, an unsaturated alcohol. Here, we investigate the reaction mechanism, including the relay function, yielding the final carbonyl group transformation. M 06 calculations predict a ΔΔG ⧧ of 1 kcal/mol for the site selectivity and 2. 5 kcal/mol for the enantioselectivity, in quantitative agreement with experimental results. The site selectivity is controlled by a remote electronic effect, where the developing polarization of the alkene in the migratory insertion transition state is stabilized by the C−O dipole <b>of</b> the <b>alcohol</b> moiety. The enantioselectivity is controlled by steric repulsion between the oxazoline substituent and the alcohol-bearing alkene substituent. The relay efficiency is due to an unusually smooth potential energy surface without high barriers, where the hydroxyalkyl-palladium species acts as a thermodynamic sink, driving the reaction toward the carbonyl product. Computational predictions of the relative reactivity and selectivity of the double bond isomers are validated experimentally. The Heck reaction is an excellent method to introduce an aromatic group to {{one end of a}} double bond using palladium-catalysis. 1, 2 The asymmetric variant of the Heck reaction ha...|$|R
