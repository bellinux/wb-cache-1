Peters was also convicted by the jury for his role in a scheme to divert valuable assets from the bank, which involved returning cheques payable to World Auto Parts to customers, asking that these cheques be redrafted to ITEC, a company that Peters had formed without the Chase Manhattan Bank's knowledge.|$|E
500|$|The system's roots {{date back}} to 1878, when an {{official}} from Spain's Department of Public Works for the Philippines submitted {{a proposal for a}} Manila streetcar system. [...] The system proposed was a five-line network emanating from Plaza San Gabriel in Binondo, running to Intramuros, Malate, Malacañan Palace, Sampaloc and Tondo. The project was approved and in 1882, Spanish German businessman Jacobo Zóbel de Zangroniz, Spanish engineer Luciano M. Bremon, and Spanish banker Adolfo Bayo, founded the Compañia de los Tranvias de Filipinas to operate the concession granted by the Spanish colonial government. The Malacañan Palace line was later replaced with a line linking Manila to Malabon, and construction began in 1885. [...] Four German-made steam-operated locomotives and eight coaches for nine passengers each, composed the initial <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> [...] The Manila-Malabon line was the first line of the new system to be finished, opening to the public on October 20, 1888, {{with the rest of the}} network opening in 1889. From the beginning it proved to be a very popular line, with services originating from Tondo as early as 5:30a.m. and ending at 7:30p.m., while trips from Malabon were from 6:00a.m. until 8:00p.m., every hour on the hour in the mornings, and every half-hour beginning at 1:30p.m. in the afternoon.|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{corporate}} insolvency laws {{of a number}} of common law jurisdictions, where a company has been engaged in misconduct or where the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> are thought to be in jeopardy, it is sometimes possible to put a company into provisional liquidation, whereby a liquidator is appointed on an interim basis to safeguard the position of the company pending the hearing of the full winding-up petition.

50|$|Because {{combination}} companies only {{performed a}} single play, {{they were not}} restricted {{by the need to}} use generic properties.

2500|$|As most secured lenders {{will not}} usually have {{recourse}} to their security until the debtor company is in a parlous financial state, the usual {{position is that}} even all the remaining <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> are not enough to repay the debt secured by the floating charge, leaving the unsecured creditors with nothing. [...] This perception {{has led to a}} widening of the classes of preferred creditors who take ahead of the floating charge holders in a number of countries. [...] The introduction of a regime of voidable floating charges for floating charges taken just prior to the onset of insolvency is a partial response to these criticisms.|$|E
2500|$|In {{countries}} that permit {{the making of}} an administration order, the floating charge had another key benefit. [...] The holder of a floating charge could appoint an administrative receiver and block {{the appointment of a}} court-appointed administrator, and thus retain control of the distribution of the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> [...] Practice became such that companies were asked to give [...] "lightweight" [...] floating charges to secured lenders which had no collateral value purely to allow the holders to block administration orders, an approach that was approved by the courts in Re Croftbell Ltd [...] BCC 781. [...] In the United Kingdom the law has now been changed by statute, but the power to block appointments of administrators has been retained in many other common law jurisdictions.|$|E
