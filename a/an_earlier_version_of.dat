5|$|The Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer and {{a close friend of}} Kirk and Spock. Kelley was {{dissatisfied}} with <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the script to the point that he considered not taking part. Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film's lighter lines, and felt that this role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama.|$|E
5|$|The chassis {{was derived}} from the T1E2 chassis, <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the M13. Based on an M3 Half-track chassis, it {{replaced}} the M13 MGMC half-track after early 1944. As aircraft became more advanced, the usefulness of the M16 was reduced. In the Korean War, it was relegated primarily to the ground-support role, being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1951.|$|E

5|$|The twin Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} in 1977, each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source. Over 30 years later, each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft. <b>An</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> {{the same technology}} powered five Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages, starting with Apollo 12 in 1969.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} that was edited before it was {{publicly}} screened had included a painting class on the lunar base that included Kubrick's daughters, additional scenes {{of life on the}} base, and Floyd buying a bush baby from a department store via videophone for his daughter. A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with actual scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life, was removed after an early screening for MGM executives. The text survives in the book The Making of Kubrick's 2001 by Jerome Agel.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system. The new version offered the ability for the player to pause repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their weapons at a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the game.|$|E

5|$|The 800th {{anniversary of}} the {{original}} charter occurred on 15 June 2015, and organisations and institutions planned celebratory events. The British Library brought together the four existing copies of the 1215 manuscript in February 2015 for a special exhibition. British artist Cornelia Parker was commissioned {{to create a new}} artwork, Magna Carta (An Embroidery), which was shown at the British Library between May and July 2015. The artwork is a copy of <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> this Wikipedia page (as it appeared on the document's 799th anniversary, 15 June 2014), hand-embroidered by over 200 people.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} politics, Southey {{believed}} that {{war with the}} post-revolution France was inappropriate when he first started composing Madoc. By the time the poem was finished, Southey was an advocate for a war against Napoleon's government. Instead of supporting his own government in return, he was opposed {{to the government of}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. The poem is also heavily grounded in Southey's ideas on Pantisocracy, and it includes <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> his democratic ideal within a mythic form. The connection between Wales and America within the poem alludes to Southey's own plans to travel from Wales to settle in America to start a new societal system.|$|E
5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher. <b>An</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, {{but this was the first}} time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts {{relate to each other}} cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.|$|E
5|$|The ships' armor {{protection}} was improved over earlier designs. The {{belt and}} barbette armor was increased by an inch compared to <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the twelve-gun battleship. A new protection scheme for the funnels was devised, after the Russian {{experience at the}} Battle of Tsushima three years before had highlighted {{the risk of a}} destroyed exhaust system. The designers also emphasized the need for improved underwater protection. As a result, the Wyomings design incorporated a torpedo bulkhead, the first time the feature was included on an American battleship design. Congress approved two new battleships, BB-32 and BB-33, on 3 March 1909. Design 502 later proved to be the basis for the subsequent class of battleships, the s.|$|E
5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.|$|E

5|$|The 1913 {{edition of}} the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several {{separate}} accounts of the saint's deeds and miracles, or so-called Lives. The Life (or Vita) printed in John Capgrave's Nova, Legenda and used by the Bollandists, was perhaps copied from a Cotton manuscript in the British Museum. There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection, {{but it was so}} damaged by fire that it is useless. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 (the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated) and are copies from an earlier manuscript, now lost. The Vita describes Seaxburh's early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, withdrawal to Milton and then Minster-in-Sheppey, and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely. The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment, dating between the 9th and 11th centuries, and currently kept at Lambeth Palace. It has been suggested that part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from this manuscript, or that both parts originated from <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Seaxburh's Life.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
