Other reviews have been positive; Matthew Pollesel of Splendid Magazine praised the album for its lyrical content: [...] "...as Daara J show throughout Boomerang, it's possible to get the meaning of those words just by listening {{to the things that}} surround them—the intensity of the rappers' delivery, the quality of the beats, and how well <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> factors coalesce around the words. And on that score, Daara J's message comes through loud and clear." [...] However, Katharina Lobeck of BBC Music noted that one of the tracks, the R-influenced [...] "Hip Hop Civilization" [...] is [...] "too generically soppy for even the most hardened R fans", but {{went on to say that}} the album is [...] "a successful sonic adventure which thrives on its defiance of the margins of established sales categories".|$|E

He singled out the game's writing, characters and plot structure as its best elements. Amiga Powers Mark Ramshaw wrote, [...] "With The Secret of Monkey Island, the mouse-controlled, graphic-adventure comes of age." [...] He lauded its comedic elements, which he believed were the highlight of the game. The reviewer also praised the control scheme, noting that it allows the player to [...] "more or less forget about the specifics of what [...] physically doing ... and lose [...] in the adventure instead." [...] He noted that the game's plot and visual and aural presentation fit together to create a thick atmosphere, and finished, [...] "Forget <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> milestone adventures (Zork, The Hobbit, [...] et al) — for sheer enjoyment and general all-round perfection, The Secret of Monkey Island creams 'em all in style." [...] The game, along with its sequel, was ranked the 19th best game of all time by Amiga Power.|$|E

Likewise, Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post wrote that Beyoncé [...] "goes full on femme fatale" [...] and concluded that the concept of the video [...] "is about as straightforward as can be". Marc Hogan of Spin magazine noted, [...] "The video follows pretty literally from the song's theme, with Mrs. Jay-Z grinding sensuously."

Urrutia attempted to distance the Cuban government (including Castro) from the growing influence of the Communists within the administration, making a series of critical public comments against the latter group. Whilst Castro had not openly declared any affiliation with the Cuban communists, Urrutia had been a declared anti-Communist since they had refused to support the insurrection against Batista, stating in an interview, [...] "If the Cuban people had heeded those words, we would still have Batista with us ... and <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> war criminals who are now running away".|$|E

2500|$|More {{far-reaching}} was the Kantakouzenos' {{involvement in}} promoting the career of Michael the Brave, who had served as Ban of Oltenia. Possibly appointed to this office by Iane himself, in or around 1590, Michael was in open conflict with Prince Alexander the Wicked after 1593, and, according to legend, miraculously escaped execution. The Kantakouzenos, and especially Andronikos, were instrumental in obtaining him the Wallachian throne. This includes collecting 400,000 ducats (45 million USD in 1995) from the various creditors of Istanbul, a loan which Michael had paid up in September 1593. One of Andronikos' letters to a Moldavian favorite, Peter the Lame, states that the Kantakouzenos viewed Michael as the only viable candidate [...] "of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> sinners [...] cunning beys". Kantakouzenos also takes pride in noting that Wallachians [...] "thanked God" [...] and [...] "blessed my late parents" [...] for his selection of [...] "such a good shepherd, such a good Christian" [...] as Michael. According to Iorga, the sponsor implicitly scolded Peter, but still kept him as his reserve option for the Moldavian throne against Aaron. As Vergatti notes, such musings also indicate that Andronikos expected a high return on his original investment, and was already expecting Michael to reappoint him as Vistier.|$|E

2500|$|Horace {{developed}} {{a number of}} inter-related themes throughout his poetic career, including politics, love, philosophy and ethics, his own social role, as well as poetry itself. His Epodes and Satires are forms of 'blame poetry' and both have a natural affinity with the moralising and diatribes of Cynicism. This often {{takes the form of}} allusions to the work and philosophy of Bion of Borysthenes [...] but it is as much a literary game as a philosophical alignment. By the time he composed his Epistles, he was a critic of Cynicism along with all impractical and [...] "high-falutin" [...] philosophy in general. The Satires also include a strong element of Epicureanism, with frequent allusions to the Epicurean poet Lucretius. So for example the Epicurean sentiment carpe diem is the inspiration behind Horace's repeated punning on his own name (Horatius ~ hora) in Satires 2.6. The Satires also feature some Stoic, Peripatetic and Platonic (Dialogues) elements. In short, the Satires present a medley of philosophical programs, dished up in no particular ordera style of argument typical of the genre. The Odes display a wide range of topics. Over time, he becomes more confident about his political voice. Although he is often thought of as an overly intellectual lover, he is ingenuous in representing passion. The [...] "Odes" [...] weave various philosophical strands together, with allusions and statements of doctrine present in {{about a third of the}} Odes Books 1-3, ranging from the flippant (1.22, 3.28) to the solemn (2.10, 3.2, 3.3). Epicureanism is the dominant influence, characterizing about twice as many of these odes as Stoicism. A group of odes combines these two influences in tense relationships, such as Odes 1.7, praising Stoic virility and devotion to public duty while also advocating private pleasures among friends. While generally favouring the Epicurean lifestyle, the lyric poet is as eclectic as the satiric poet, and in Odes 2.10 even proposes Aristotle's golden mean as a remedy for Rome's political troubles. Many of Horace's poems also contain much reflection on genre, the lyric tradition, and the function of poetry. Odes 4, thought to be composed at the emperor's request, takes the themes of the first three books of [...] "Odes" [...] to a new level. This book shows greater poetic confidence after the public performance of his [...] "Carmen saeculare" [...] or [...] "Century hymn" [...] at a public festival orchestrated by Augustus. In it, Horace addresses the emperor Augustus directly with more confidence and proclaims his power to grant poetic immortality to those he praises. It is the least philosophical collection of his verses, excepting the twelfth ode, addressed to the dead Virgil as if he were living. In that ode, the epic poet and the lyric poet are aligned with Stoicism and Epicureanism respectively, in a mood of bitter-sweet pathos. The first poem of the Epistles sets the philosophical tone for the rest of the collection: [...] "So now I put aside both verses and <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>other</b> games: What is true and what befits is my care, this my question, this my whole concern." [...] His poetic renunciation of poetry in favour of philosophy is intended to be ambiguous. Ambiguity is the hallmark of the Epistles. It is uncertain if those being addressed by the self-mocking poet-philosopher are being honoured or criticized. Though he emerges as an Epicurean, it is on the understanding that philosophical preferences, like political and social choices, are a matter of personal taste. Thus he depicts the ups and downs of the philosophical life more realistically than do most philosophers.|$|E
