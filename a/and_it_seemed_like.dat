Muharrar said, [...] "Once we thought about it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> it was time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] that Jerry was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E

500|$|The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was {{mirrored}} {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member. During that scene, the two overlook {{what was once the}} pit, but was now a filled-in lot, and Mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on the cheek and leaving. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale.

Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit.

500|$|Due to the band's lack of {{creative}} {{control on the}} first album, Smith exerted a greater influence on the recording of the Cure's second album Seventeen Seconds, which he co-produced with Mike Hedges. The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the UK charts. A single from the album, [...] "A Forest", became the band's first UK hit single, reaching number 31 on the singles chart. The album was {{a departure from the}} Cure's sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as [...] "morose, atmospheric, very different to Three Imaginary Boys." [...] In its review of Seventeen Seconds the NME said, [...] "For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time." [...] At the same time, Smith was pressed concerning the concept of an alleged [...] "anti-image". Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be [...] "elaborately disguising their plainness", stating, [...] "We had to get away from that anti-image thing, which we didn't even create in the first place. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand." [...] That same year Three Imaginary Boys was repackaged for the American market as Boys Don't Cry, with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, [...] "I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music—the sort of thing that didn't interest me at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|While it was {{generally}} thought that Henry Cow took their name from 20th-century American composer Henry Cowell, this has been repeatedly denied by band members.

It had no connection to anything.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{satisfied}} with the album's keyboard-dominated production nor the band's commercialized image, John Norum decided to leave Europe in November 1986 to pursue a solo career. [...] "I didn't really like the direction the band was going in," [...] Norum said, [...] "We became this teeny-bopper, bubblegum band and I hated that whole image, the spandex, poodle-rock type of thing. I was more into the heavier, guitar-oriented stuff <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the keyboards were taking over more and more, and we were becoming more commercial.

I look back on it now and it’s a little dated, but it’s still fantastic, and I think it’s got some of the great villains of all time in there.

That was the understanding, that was the deal. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{there was not a}} lot of disagreement over that; that seemed to emerge as a fact, because it became rather apparent that the Stones didn't know what kind of people they were dealing with." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of the Philippines during World War II, Aguinaldo cooperated with the Japanese, making speeches, issuing articles and radio addresses {{in support of the}} Japanese—including a radio appeal to Gen.

We were outnumbered, too, in constant retreat. I saw my own soldiers die without affecting future events. To me that seemed to be what was happening on Bataan, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good thing to stop." [...] After the combined American and Filipino troops retook the Philippines in 1945, Aguinaldo was arrested along with several others accused of collaboration with the Japanese, and jailed for some months in Bilibid prison. He was released by presidential amnesty.|$|E

40|$|These studies {{investigated}} self-regulation {{and subjective}} experience of {{time from the}} perspective of the regulatory resource model. Studies 1 – 2 showed that participants who were instructed to regulate their emotions while viewing a film clip perceived that the film lasted longer than participants who did not regulate their emotions. In Study 3, participants provided time estimates during a resource-depleting or nondepleting task. Subsequent task persistence was measured. Time perceptions mediated the effect of initial self-regulation on subsequent self-regulated performance. In Study 4, participants performed either a resource-depleting or a nondepleting thought-listing task and then performed a different regulatory task. Compared with nondepleted participants, depleted participants persisted less on the 2 nd task but estimated that they had persisted longer. Subjective time estimates statistically accounted for reduced persistence after depletion. Together, results indicate people believe that self-regulatory endeavors last overly long, a belief that may result in abandonment of further self-control.
