The ground plans of buildings had already been acquired either in analog form by maps and plans or digitally in a 2D GIS. The project was done in order to enable an <b>automatic</b> <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> by the integration of these different types of information. Afterwards virtual reality city models are generated in the project by texture processing, e.g. by mapping of terrestrial images. The project demonstrated the feasibility of rapid acquisition of 3D urban GIS. Ground plans proved are another very important source of information for 3D building reconstruction. Compared to results of automatic procedures, these ground plans proved more reliable since they contain aggregated information which has been made explicit by human interpretation. For this reason, ground plans, can considerably reduce costs in a reconstruction project. An example of existing ground plan data usable in building reconstruction is the Digital Cadastral map, which provides information {{on the distribution of}} property, including the borders of all agricultural areas and the ground plans of existing buildings. Additionally information as street names and the usage of buildings (e.g. garage, residential building, office block, industrial building, church) is provided in the form of text symbols. At the moment the Digital Cadastral map is built up as a data base covering an area, mainly composed by digitizing preexisting maps or plans.|$|E

Moreover, the process of recording data manually tends to have a higher potential of error, because the process relies heavily on the accuracy of the operators who perform the data recording. Therefore, it is necessary to process the data recording automatically.

We use the RFID technology to assure automatic identification and communication with a product and UPnP technology (Universal Plug and Play) to allow developing product-to-process interaction, product-to-product interaction, product-to-environment and product-to-user interactions.

Thus, a product can analyze each stage in the supply chain, to control its needs and to avoid the critical situations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a three year investigation into combining labelled and unlabelled data for data classification. In the present world, there are many fields in which the quantity of data available to workers in that field has increased exponentially over the last few years. This has in part been due to improved methods of <b>automatic</b> <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> and in part due to improved electronic communication particularly via the internet. These vast quantities of data require some form of processing in order to transform the data into information. This is often a costly business requiring human (often expert) intervention. Our rationale for this investigation is that we wish to augment the information provided by the human experts with data which has not been processed by human experts. The actual method we investigate is classification using both processed (labelled) and unprocessed (unlabelled) data {{in order to reduce the}} requirement for human intervention. In Chapter 2 of the thesis we review several aspects of this problem as it features in the current literature.
