This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E

It made so {{tremendous}} an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room." ...|$|E

500|$|Hubert Wellington {{said that}} while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the {{dominating}} enthusiasm of his youth was for Géricault. The dramatic composition of Géricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, [...] "Géricault <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see his Raft of Medusa {{while he was still}} working on it." [...] The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's The Barque of Dante (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840).|$|E
500|$|Richard O'Brien {{was living}} as an {{unemployed}} actor in London {{during the early}} 1970s. He wrote most of The Rocky Horror Show during one winter just to occupy himself. Since his youth, O'Brien had loved science fiction and B horror movies. He wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, Steve Reeves muscle flicks, and fifties rock and roll into his musical. O'Brien conceived and wrote the play set {{against the backdrop of}} the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the 1970s. Allowing his concept to come into being, O'Brien states [...] "glam rock <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be myself more".|$|E
500|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from the novel. He titled his script Angel Heart {{as he wanted}} to {{distance}} his film adaptation from the source material. While Falling Angel is set entirely in New York City, Parker had {{the second half of}} his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to voodoo and the occult. He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision and said that he had considered setting his novel in New Orleans. Angel Heart is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. Parker explained, [...] "1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s—and, because of the historical pause button of World War II, conceivably the 1930s—so quite simply, setting it in this year <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give an older look to the film." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Sasha {{signed with}} Global Underground to produce another mix album. However, {{he found the}} process of {{creating}} a standard mix album unrewarding, and decided to apply his production and DJing skills to a mix compilation that resembled a [...] "real" [...] album—that is, one featuring original material. [...] Sasha's next studio album, Involver, was [...] "a fusion of mix album and [...] ", consisting entirely of Sasha's reworkings of tracks by other artists. [...] "I tried to take all the separate sounds to all the tracks [...] ", he later explained, [...] "and it <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> mix the tracks together on a much deeper level." [...] He accomplished this by sequencing the album using Ableton Live and Logic Pro. [...] Ableton Live is a music loop-based software package that Sasha uses to engineer tracks in real-time, whereas he used Logic Pro primarily for premeditated edits to audio tracks.|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunner Wyman {{also served}} as episode director, marking his {{television}} directorial debut. He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things that we talk about on Fringe." ...|$|E
500|$|Saltzman {{disliked the}} design's {{resemblance}} to a prison, but Hamilton liked it {{enough that it}} was built. The comptroller of Fort Knox later {{sent a letter to}} Adam and the production team, complimenting them on their imaginative depiction of the vault. United Artists even had irate letters from people wondering [...] "how could a British film unit be allowed inside Fort Knox?" [...] Adam recalled, [...] "In the end I was pleased that I wasn't allowed into Fort Knox, because it <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do whatever I wanted." [...] In fact, the set was deemed so realistic that Pinewood Studios had to post a 24-hour guard to keep the gold bar props from being stolen. Another element which was original was the atomic device, to which Hamilton requested the special effects crew to get inventive instead of realistic. Technician Bert Luxford described the end result as looking like an [...] "engineering work", with a spinning engine, a chronometer and other decorative pieces.|$|E

500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said.

She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated.

500|$|Bowie {{agreed to}} what {{at the time}} was {{considered}} a controversial commercial sponsorship agreement with PepsiCo, which was later seen as helping {{to pave the way for}} other big money tours by other artists. For his part, Bowie recorded a TV commercial with Tina Turner to the tune [...] "Modern Love" [...] in May 1987 while he was preparing for the tour. The commercial had a short run, as Pepsi withdrew the commercial after Bowie was accused of sexual assault during the tour. Of the sponsorship agreement, Bowie said, [...] "We did a commercial sponsorship thing only for North America with the Pepsi-Cola company. As far as I'm concerned, what it's <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do, having them underwrite the tour, is to be able to produce a far more extravagant show than if I were just doing it myself. It means that instead of just having 1 or 2 sets I can have 3 or 4 sets made, and they can travel independently and they can be far more complicated." ...|$|E
500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's hard for me to sit here and talk about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album.

The album ranked at number-one in the list for the [...] "10 Best Albums of 2015 in Mexico" [...] by newspaper El País; according to the reviewer Luis Pablo Beauregard, it is an album [...] "naked and raw, where the lyrics and fragility of her voice draw the footprint of heartbreak". The American edition of Rolling Stone magazine placed Hasta la Raíz at number 3 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Albums of the Year", arguing that [...] "the loftiness of the album's ambitions are tempered by Lafourcade's masterful songwriting, which remains as deft as a Mesut Özil cross pass". The editors of Billboard magazine ranked the album at number 2 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Albums of 2015", stating that the singer [...] "manages to be retro and futuristic at the same time ... the sound is so unexpected, that coupled with Lafourcade's sweet vocals, it's arresting". Website AllMusic included the album on their list for the [...] "Best of 2015: Favorite Latin and World Albums", explaining that Lafourcade [...] "delivers an intimate, poignant, quietly powerful collection of heartbreak songs on this gem of an album".|$|E
