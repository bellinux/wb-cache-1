5|$|The {{macaroni}} penguin's predators {{consist of}} birds and aquatic mammals. The leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus gazella), Subantarctic fur seal (A. tropicalis), and killer whale (Orcinus orca) sometimes hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water. Colonies suffer low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally only take eggs and young that have been left unattended or deserted. Skua species, the snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), and kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) prey on eggs, and skuas and giant petrels also sometimes take chicks.|$|E

25|$|The Hersilia {{departed}} from Stonington, Connecticut for the Antarctic Ocean in July 1819. Over {{a decade later}} Edmund Fanning claimed that it was sent to go exploring the southern Pacific Ocean. However this has been challenged by later historians, who question Fanning's assertion. Sheffield served as its captain, W. Fanning as supercargo and Nathaniel Palmer as second mate. The Hersilia stopped in the Falkland Islands to procure much needed water and food supplies. It is uncertain the precise date the Hersilia reached the South Shetland Islands, but it was primarily stationed at Hersilia Cove on Rugged Island. An estimated 9,000 <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> {{were killed by the}} crew for their valuable pelts over the span of two weeks.

500|$|Unlike {{terrestrial}} mammals, such as rodents, pinnipeds do {{not move}} their vibrissae over an object when examining it but instead extend their moveable whiskers and {{keep them in the}} same position. By holding their vibrissae steady, pinnipeds are able to maximize their detection ability. The vibrissae of phocids are undulated and wavy while otariid and walrus vibrissae are smooth. Research is ongoing to determine the function, if any, of these shapes on detection ability.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the degree to which}} the behavior of a predator in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of prey. It examined this in <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus gazella) feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> at the bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information about energy expenditures in <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and was used within the framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> conformed to many of the predictions from energy rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy intake by <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches increased as apparent food availability declined. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to be responsible for allowing <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> to maintain saturation of the foraging rate as food density declines...|$|R

40|$|Modelling <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations {{requires}} the accurate assessment of demographic parameters such as age-specific mortality. Owing to the highly variable mortality rates that pups are subject to, mortality {{of this age}} class {{is perhaps the most}} important factor determining the number of surviving individuals within each cohort. Early pup mortality,sex ratio and median pupping date were determined for sympatric populations of Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus tropicalis) and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (A. gazella) at Marion Island, Southern Ocean. Mortality for this species was density dependent, varying from 0. 8 % at low density sites to 10. 9 % at high density sites. More accurate methods employed at low-density sites showed a substantially higher pup mortality at three weeks of 1. 3 - 3. 4 % for Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> The same method yielded a mortality estimate at four weeks of age of 1. 1 - 5. 1 % for <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> Despite the underestimate inherent in island-wide counts for Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> these estimates are still useful for observing temporal and spatial patterns. Sex ratios were at parity for newborns of both species. The sex ratio of eightweek-old Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> pups was also at parity, which is unusual for <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations.

40|$|This study {{examined}} three competing hypotheses {{to explain how}} lactating <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus gazella) respond {{to changes in the}} level of resource availability. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> have episodic bouts of suckling (1 - 3 days), alternating with foraging trips (3 - 10 days). Foraging time budgets varied significantly (p <. 001) among 8 consecutive years at Bird Island, South Georgia. Foraging trip duration increased during periods of relative food shortage. Time spent ashore was more consistent among years than foraging trip duration but declined during a year of particularly low food availability. In 4 of the 8 years, there was a significant positive correlation between time spent ashore and foraging trip duration. In the other years, the relationship was close to statistical significance. Energy delivery to pups during suckling bouts followed an asymptotic power function. Energy gain during foraging trips was estimated from diving behavior, which suggested that the energy gain function was linear. Distance traveled during foraging trips was correlated with foraging trip duration, and long foraging trips were associated with reduced foraging intensity. There was support for the hypothesis that lactating <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> compensate for reduced resources by increasing the foraging trip duration rather than working harder and increasing their energy expenditure. However, there was most support for the hypothesis that lactating <b>Antarctic</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> adjust time spent ashore as well as foraging trip duration, possibly to maximize the delivery of food to their offspring. Lactation appears to impose constraints on provisioning of offspring that differ from those of seabirds foraging in the same environment and often on the same prey...|$|R
