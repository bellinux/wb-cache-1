5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E

25|$|On 24 April 2014, it was {{reported}} in the Italian magazine Credere that the late pope could possibly be beatified on 19 October 2014. This report from the magazine further stated that several cardinals and bishops would meet on 5 May to confirm the miracle that had previously been approved, and then present it to Pope Francis who may sign the decree for beatification shortly after that. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints held that meeting and positively concluded that the healing was indeed <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> could be attributed to the late pope. The matter shall now soon be presented to the pope for approval.|$|E
25|$|According to a later legend, the {{sanctuary}} was erected by Emperor Leo I the Thracian (r. 457–474) because of <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> occurred {{when he was}} still a soldier. Before entering the City, Leo met a blind man who asked him to give him water. A female voice ordered the future Emperor to wet the eyes of the blind man with water from a nearby swamp. The same voice added that she had chosen that very place to be worshiped and that he would one day receive the crown to the empire. Leo followed her order and at once the blind man recovered his eyesight. After his accession to the throne, the Emperor erected a magnificent church on this place. This legend is possibly a later invention of the monks of {{the sanctuary}}. It is possible that, before the Justinian's building was erected, a small monastery had already existed there.|$|E

500|$|The Quran {{describes}} the annunciation to Mary (Maryam) by an angel {{that she is}} {{to give birth to}} Jesus while remaining a virgin.

Jesus is called the [...] "Spirit of God" [...] because he was born through the action of the Spirit, but that belief does not imply his pre-existence.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1980s, Sam Tellig {{wrote in}} Stereophile that the Rega 3 [...] "is a good-sounding {{turntable}} {{and a good}} value—at the UK price ... it's <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> the Rega sounds {{as good as it}} does" [...] compared with the apparently better built Harman-Kardon T60. From a sound quality viewpoint, Tellig noted [...] "a very dynamic sound with powerful, punchy bass—the table conveys the music's excitement... too much emphasis of the mid- to upper-bass [...] tends to sound a little muddy in bass detail". He added that the deck's pitch instability was audible [...] "every so often, particularly with woodwinds". Szabady, in Stereo Times, also agreed that musical expressiveness was the classic [...] strength; its weaknesses included occasional speed inconsistency and slurring of heavily modulated bass transients.|$|E

He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people.

500|$|... "Home" [...] {{has often}} been cited {{as one of the}} best X-Files episodes. VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club placed it among the 10 best {{chapters}} of the series and called it one of the scariest hours of television he had seen. In 2009, The Vancouver Sun named [...] "Home" [...] one of the best stand-alone episodes of the series and wrote that, because of its horrific theme of incest, the episode [...] "doesn't pull any punches". Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi placed the entry as the fourth best of the series in 2009, viewing its bleak humor and [...] "thought-provoking moments" [...] of dialogue as the factors that made it one of the most popular episodes. In 2008, Starpulse gave the installment an honorable mention as one of the 10 best X-Files episodes. In 2009, Connie Ogle from PopMatters rated the Peacock family among the greatest monsters of the series and stated that it was <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> the program [...] "slipped past" [...] the censors.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of Eureka, a vehement anonymous censure {{was published in the}} Literary Review. Poe believed it to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820–1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as pantheistic and [...] "a damnable heresy" [...] that [...] "conscience would compel him to denounce". Literary critic George Edward Woodberry in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school [...] "rendered ridiculous" [...] by absurdity and the density of his ignorance. Thomas Dunn English, a writer, lawyer, and doctor who frequently criticized Poe, wrote a news article for the John-Donkey with the headline, [...] "Great Literary Crash". The article explained that a shelf of books crashed because someone had [...] "imprudently" [...] stacked an edition of Eureka on it and that it was <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> the whole building did not fall down because of it.|$|E

What helped UE to weather these storms was its own democratic structure and manner of operation, and its superior record of representing members (when contrasted with the IUE, for example) in collective bargaining and in fighting for shop grievances. Both of these attributes engendered fierce loyalty to UE among many of its members, even as the union was being slandered by powerful forces as some sort of national security threat.|$|E

They were quite ready to fire for me the larger pieces of ceramics in their old-fashioned kiln, one not used anymore elsewhere, heated by coal and coke. They could get only one temperature and one kind of glaze. You could not make any changes and I realized that every piece could be fired only once. So I had to put the colours and the glazes and the body in one firing only. It was <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> it came out quite alright, with very few small cracks.
