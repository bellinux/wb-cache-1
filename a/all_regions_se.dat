40|$|Factors which {{effect the}} {{differences}} and similarities between spot {{prices in the}} <b>region</b> <b>SE</b> 3 (Stockholm) and the <b>region</b> <b>SE</b> 4 (Malmö) are investigated. Predictors, which may influence the spot prices, are electricity consumption, electricity production, electricity flow, electricity capacity, wind power production and other electricity indexes. The significance of a statistical analysis crucially depends on the choice of an adequate model. In this thesis {{the focus is on}} regression building. Well established candidates are the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory (ARIMAX). Preference should be given to non-parametric methods in case the data apparently cannot be explained by any model at hand. For parameter estimation the methods are the maximum likelihood method, the least-squares method and the Local Scoring procedure. Selected models are tested on energy data for the <b>regions</b> <b>SE</b> 3 (Stockholm) and SE 4 (Malm¨o). The models provide quite good results, and allow to distinguish the degree to which each factor influences on the spot price. It is established that electricity consumption, electricity production and wind power production have a major influence on the spot price formation. Besides, import/export flows of SE 3 /SE 4 regions partially explain the differences in the spot price between these regions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{patterns of}} FDI inflows to Southern European (<b>SE)</b> <b>regions,</b> {{which seem to}} be at the margin of the FDI attraction game accounting for a very small share of total inward FDI in the EU. In order to understand why these regions attracted such a low number of foreign investors, this contribution provides the following analysis: i) an overall picture of the main characteristics of patterns of inward FDI in <b>SE</b> <b>regions</b> at geographical and sectoral level; ii) the factors that drive FDI flows into EU regions; iii) as assessment of the potential of attractiveness of <b>SE</b> <b>regions,</b> both in absolute terms and with respect to other EU regions. The main results indicate that <b>SE</b> <b>regions</b> are definitively less attractive than other EU regions, though a lot of variation does exist at both geographical and sectoral level. In order to improve their capacity to attract FDI <b>SE</b> <b>regions</b> should improve their factors of attractiveness by implementing several structural reform...|$|R

40|$|The Jeffara Plain, in Medenine <b>region</b> (<b>SE</b> Tunisia), suffers of dry climatic conditions. Lower Triassic {{sandstones}} widely outcrop {{within the}} Plain and they host a strategic aquifer exploited for drinking and irrigation purposes. An insufficient natural recharge {{and an increasing}} water demand have led to an overexploitation of such aquifer. Water harvesting techniques and particularly Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) systems can be useful tools for restoring groundwater resources. To better design the MAR system and to characterize the local geological setting, an Electrical Resistivity Tomography survey was conducted in six selected sites in the Jeffara Plain, within the frame of EU WADIS-MAR project...|$|R

50|$|The {{optimization}} problem for each time {{step is to}} minimize the electricity supply cost using the existing power plant fleet for <b>all</b> <b>regions.</b> After this regional dispatch, the exchange between the regions is carried out and is restricted by the grid capacity. This latter problem is solved with a heuristic procedure rather than calculated deterministically. The input is the merit order, the marginal power plant, the excess energy (renewable energy that could be curtailed), and the excess demand (the demand that cannot be supplied) for each region. The exchange algorithm seeks the least cost for <b>all</b> <b>regions,</b> thus the target function is to minimize the total costs of <b>all</b> <b>regions,</b> given the existing grid infrastructure, storage, and generating capacities. The total cost {{is defined as the}} residual load multiplied by the price in each <b>region,</b> summed over <b>all</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R
