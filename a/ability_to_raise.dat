5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, {{that some form of}} boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Baxter {{was known}} for his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a team's morale, his good {{tactical}} vision, precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way – and for being a joker on the pitch. He also broke with Glasgow tradition by becoming friendly with several members of their major Glasgow rivals, Celtic.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans {{had great}} {{diplomatic}} skill and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> {{vast numbers of}} troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines, {{they were able to}} exploit the hardships of the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. Those that did not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon mastered the art of siege warfare.|$|E
50|$|Soon after Schröpfer's death {{there was}} a plethora of polemic {{publications}} either attacking or defendeding his supposed <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> ghosts, including writings by Moses Mendelssohn, Christian August Crusius, Balthasar Bekker a Johann Christian Wiegleb. Schrepfers became quite famous across Europe. Several publications included explanations of techniques he might have used to conjure apparitions, which inspired several people to recreate Schrepfer's séances.|$|R
50|$|Soon after Schrepfer's death {{there was}} a boom of {{publications}} attacking or defending his supposed <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> ghosts, expanding Schrepfer's fame across Europe. Several publications included explanations of techniques he might have used to conjure apparitions, which inspired several people to recreate Schrepfer's séances. Christlieb Benedikt Funk, Professor of Physics at the Leipzig University was possibly the first to publicly re-create such ghost-raising demonstrations, but was ordered to stop by the university's authorities.|$|R
50|$|A {{horizontal}} {{fiscal imbalance}} (HFI) emerges when sub-national governments have different <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> funds from their tax bases {{and to provide}} services. This creates differences in ‘net fiscal benefits’, which are a combination of levels of taxation and public services. It is these NFBs which are {{the main cause of}} horizontal fiscal disparities that in turn generate the need for equalization grants. Prominent among the objectives commonly attributed to intergovernmental fiscal transfers is ‘equalization’ of fiscal capacities or resolution of Horizontal Fiscal Imbalances.|$|R
5|$|With {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war, Henry's {{government}} faced the task of rebuilding royal authority across large parts of the country. By the end of 1217 many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre, and even Henry's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles. Illegally constructed fortifications, called adulterine castles, had sprung up across much of the country. The network of county sheriffs had collapsed, and with it the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> taxes and collect royal revenues. The powerful Welsh Prince Llywelyn posed a major threat in Wales and along the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E

5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over toll rates and customer service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} lease contract. On February 2, 2004, the government delivered notice to 407ETR that they {{are considered to be}} in default of their contract because of 407ETR's decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance. The court's initial decision sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> toll rates without first consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> their heads well above the ground does not necessarily mean they browsed on items there, and the short neck of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lancaster was {{the name}} of two cadet {{branches}} of the royal House of Plantagenet. The first house was created when Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort's death and attainder {{at the end of the}} Second Barons' War. When Edmund's son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand Henry, his younger brotherinto conflict with their cousin Edward II of England, leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward's sonEdward III of England.|$|E

5|$|De Gray's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> money {{made him}} useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights {{during a period}} when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester {{remained}} in the inner circle around the king over the next months. In the summer of 1313, he was again guardian of the realm while the king was in France, and in February 1314, {{he was sent to}} France on a diplomatic mission regarding Gascony. The greatest problem of the reign, however, remained the unresolved conflict with Scotland, and the resurgence of Robert the Bruce. In the summer of 1314, Edward finally embarked on a major Scottish campaign. The objective was to protect the English garrison at Stirling Castle from an attack by Bruce. The campaign was impeded by the absence of some of the greater magnates, such as Lancaster and Warwick. There were still a number of great lords in the king's company, including Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, Pembroke and Gloucester. These men were valuable to the king for their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> large numbers of troops from their dominions in the Welsh Marches. On 23June 1314, the royal army had passed Falkirk and was within a few miles of Stirling. There were, however, signs of strife between the earls of Gloucester and Hereford. Gloucester had been given the command of the English vanguard, a position he had earned through his loyalty to the king. Yet Hereford, who had been placed under Gloucester's command, believed the command belonged to him, in his capacity of hereditary Constable of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> funds {{through the}} sale of land {{hampered}} the Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders, and caused its development of Southern Rhodesia to slow. Believing that membership in the union could help solve both problems, the Company now backed Southern Rhodesia's incorporation as South Africa's fifth province. However, this prospect proved largely unpopular among Southern Rhodesian settlers, most of whom wanted self-government, and came {{to vote for the}} RGA in large numbers. In the 1920 Legislative Council election, the RGA won ten of the 13 seats contested. A referendum on the colony's future was held on 27 October 1922—at the suggestion of Winston Churchill, then Britain's Colonial Secretary, continuing the initiative of his preprocessor Viscount Milner—and responsible government won the day by 59%. Southern Rhodesia was duly annexed by the Empire on 12 September 1923, and granted full self-government on 1 October the same year. The new Southern Rhodesian government immediately purchased the land from the British Treasury for £2million, and ten years later paid the same sum to the British South Africa Company for the country's mineral rights.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{attaching}} multiwalled carbon nanotube-alumina-coated silica (MWCNT-ACS) composite {{onto the surface}} of glassy carbon by a self-assembly process is described. The resulting MWCNT-ACS modified glassy carbon electrode was investigated by atomic force microscopy. In cyclic voltammetric responses, both anodic and cathodic peak currents varied linearly with the square root of scan rates in 0. 1 M KCl containing 5 mM Fe(CN) (6) (4 -) at MWCNT-ACS-coated glassy carbon electrode, which suggests a diffusion-controlled process. The MWCNT-ACS modified glassy carbon electrode exhibits the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the current responses and to decrease the electrooxidation potential of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and hydrogen peroxide, which is crucial in preparation of amperometric dehydrogenase- and oxidase-based biosensors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identity}} the conflict management styles being practiced by Assistant to Custom Superitendents Grade W 26 at Royal Custom Johore. About 46 respondents who were also the population of the study became the subject of this study. The five objectives being studied were to identify the assertive level, the most dominant conflict management style, the differences of conflict management styles upon demografical factors such as age. gender, marital status, academic qualification and service duration at KDRM. Next was to identify the relationship between asertive behavioural dimensions toward the conflict management style. The final objective was to identify which asertive behavioural dimensions have the most influenced towards the conflict management styles. The Dependent variable was the conflict management styles being practiced whereby the independent variables were the demografical factors and the asertive behavioural dimensions. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 12. 0 has been used as a method of analysis the mean scores, t-test. Anova. S prearm an Correlation test and the regression analysis. The assertive level among respondents were relatively moderate. The cooperative style and the compromise were found to be the most dominant conflict management sty le. The results of the t-test and Anova found that only age factor, academic qualification and years of service have significat value upon the conflict management style. The Sprearman Correlation test showed that there were medium negative relationship between the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raised</b> questions and accomodation style and medium positive relationship between the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>raised</b> questions with the cooperative style.

50|$|Song sparrows' nests are parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird. The cowbirds' eggs closely {{resemble}} song sparrows' eggs, although the cowbirds' eggs are slightly larger. Song sparrows recognize cowbirds {{as a threat}} and attack the cowbirds when they are near the nest. There {{is some evidence that}} this behavior is learned rather than instinctual. A more recent study found that the behavior of attacking female cowbirds near nests may actually attract cowbird parasitism because the female cowbirds use such behavior to identify female song sparrows that are more likely <b>to</b> successfully <b>raise</b> a cowbird chick. One study found that while cowbird parasitism did result in more nest failure, overall there were negligible effects on song sparrow populations when cowbirds were introduced to an island. The study pointed to a number of explanatory factors including song sparrows raising multiple broods, and song sparrows' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> cowbird chicks with their own.|$|R

40|$|A {{composite}} of multiwalled carbon nanotubes-chitosan (MWCNT-CHIT) {{was used as}} a matrix for entrapment of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) onto a glassy carbon electrode in order to fabricate amperometric biosensor. The homogeneity of the resulting multiwalled carbon nanotubes-chitosan-lactate dehydrogenase (MWCNT-CHIT-LDH) nanobiocomposite film was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It shows that the enzyme is homogeneously immobilized within MWCNT-CHIT-LDH. The inclusion of MWCNT within MWCNT-CHIT-LDH exhibits the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the current responses, to decrease the electrooxidation potential of P-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH), and to prevent the electrode surface fouling. The influence of several experimental parameters such as applied potential, solution pH value, NAD(+) concentration, and enzyme loading was explored to optimize the electroanalytical performance of the biosensor. The optimized biosensor for the determination of lactate shows a sensitivity of 0. 0083 AM(- 1) cm(- 2) and a response time of about 3 s.
