40|$|Background and purpose: To {{estimate}} {{the risks of}} radiation-induced rectal and bladder cancers following low dose rate (LDR) and high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy for localised prostate cancer and compare to external beam radiotherapy techniques. Materials and methods: LDR and HDR brachytherapy monotherapy plans were generated for three prostate CT datasets. Second cancer risks were assessed using Schneider’s concept of organ equivalent dose. LDR risks were assessed according to a mechanistic model and a bell-shaped model. HDR risks were assessed according to a bell-shaped model. Relative <b>risks</b> and excess <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> were estimated and compared to external beam techniques. Results: Excess <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> of second rectal or bladder cancer were low for both LDR (irrespective of the model used for calculation) and HDR techniques. Average excess <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> of rectal cancer for LDR brachytherapy according to the mechanistic model were 0. 71 per 10, 000 person-years (PY) and 0. 84 per 10, 000 PY respectively, {{and according to the}} bell-shaped model, were 0. 47 and 0. 78 per 10, 000 PY respectively. For HDR, the average excess <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> for second rectal and bladder cancers were 0. 74 and 1. 62 per 10, 000 PY respectively. The absolute differences between techniques were very low and clinically irrelevant. Compared to external beam prostate radiotherapy techniques, LDR and HDR brachytherapy resulted in the lowest risks of second rectal and bladder cancer. Conclusions: This study shows both LDR and HDR brachytherapy monotherapy result in low estimated risks of radiation-induced rectal and bladder cancer. LDR resulted in lower bladder cancer risks than HDR, and lower or similar risks of rectal cancer. In absolute terms these differences between techniques were very small. Compared to external beam techniques, second rectal and bladder cancer risks were lowest for brachytherapy...|$|R

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: <b>absolute</b> <b>risk,</b> where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure <b>absolute</b> <b>risk</b> because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many women develop {{breast cancer}} after {{treatment}} for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) {{at a young}} age. We estimated this future risk, taking into account age and calendar year of HL diagnosis, HL treatment information, population breast cancer incidence rates, and competing causes of death. METHODS: Relative risks of breast cancer for categories defined by radiation dose to the chest (0, 20 - or = 40 Gy) and use of alkylating agents (yes or no) were estimated from a case-control study conducted within an international population-based cohort of 3817 female 1 -year survivors of HL diagnosed at age 30 years or younger from January 1, 1965, through December 31, 1994. To compute cumulative <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> of breast cancer, we used modified standardized incidence ratios to relate cohort breast cancer risks {{to those in the}} general population, enabling application of population-based breast cancer rates, and we allowed for competing risks by using population-based mortality rates in female HL survivors. RESULTS: Cumulative <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> of breast cancer increased with age at end of follow-up, time since HL diagnosis, and radiation dose. For an HL survivor who was treated at age 25 years with a chest radiation dose of at least 40 Gy without alkylating agents, estimated cumulative <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> of breast cancer by age 35, 45, and 55 years were 1. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 9 % to 2. 1 %), 11. 1 % (95 % CI = 7. 4 % to 16. 3 %), and 29. 0 % (95 % CI = 20. 2 % to 40. 1 %), respectively. Cumulative <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> were lower in women treated with alkylating agents. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer projections varied considerably by type of HL therapy, time since HL diagnosis, and age at end of follow-up. These estimates are applicable to HL survivors treated with regimens of the past and can be used to counsel such patients and plan management and preventive strategies. Projections should be used with caution, however, in patients treated with more recent approaches, including limited-field radiotherapy and/or ovary-sparing chemotherap...|$|R

500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent <b>absolute</b> <b>risk</b> reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates were performed using a Markov microsimulation model and were based on the incidence of first fracture as well as life expectancy. Baseline scenario included projected mortality rates and increasing fracture incidence by 1 % per year. Alternative scenarios were performed on age, life expectancy and trends in fracture incidence. Lifetime fracture risk for osteoporotic population (T-score <or= - 2. 5) was also estimated. RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, lifetime <b>absolute</b> <b>risks</b> of hip fracture and of any major osteoporotic fracture (hip, clinical vertebral or wrist) were respectively 24. 8 % and 44. 3 %. Alternative scenarios showed that when assuming no change of age-specific fracture rates over time, these lifetime risks were 18. 3 % and 35. 2 %, while these values were 20. 0 % and 38. 3 % assuming no future mortality reductions. For osteoporotic women, these values were respectively 34. 5 % and 51. 5 %.

The risk of VTE during the postpartum period is 5-fold higher than during pregnancy. For combined oral contraceptives, VTE risk with high doses of ethinylestradiol (>50μg, e.g., 100 to 150μg) {{has been reported to}} be approximately twice that of low doses of ethinylestradiol (e.g., 20 to 50μg).

The relative risk reduction was 57.7%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (35.5% of patients had positive surgical margins following RRP), this leads to an <b>absolute</b> <b>risk</b> reduction of 20.5%. 4.9 patients must be treated for one to benefit (number needed to treat = 4.9). Other recent studies have shown RALP to result in a significantly higher rate of positive margins. Other studies showed no difference of robotic to open surgery. A 2009 French study comparing standard laparoscopic to robotic to open prostatectomy showed no difference in margin status or biochemical recurrence at 5 years. [...] The relative merits of RALP and potential benefit versus open radical prostatectomy is currently an area of intense research and debate in urology.

We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis to determine the risk of MI and nonstroke vascular death after transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke. Cohort studies of TIA or ischemic stroke patients were included if they were published between 1980 and March 2005, reported risk of MI and nonstroke vascular death, enrolled > 100 patients, and had at least 1 year of follow-up. We included 39 studies {{in a total of}} 65, 996 patients with mean follow-up of 3. 5 years. Two reviewers independently carried out data extraction using a standardized form. <b>Absolute</b> annual <b>risks</b> were estimated through weighted meta-regressions with a random effect. To test the predictions of expected event rates derived from our analysis, we used individual patient data. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: The annual risks were 2. 1 % (CI 95 %: 1. 9 to 2. 4) for nonstroke vascular death, 2. 2 % (1. 7 to 2. 7) for total MI, 0. 9 % (0. 7 to 1. 2) for nonfatal MI and 1. 1 % (0. 8 to 1. 5) for fatal MI. The time course of risk was linear. Estimated risks fitted well with observed risks at the individual level.
