The model is used to evaluate coupled dynamics of the SNAP spacecraft with both fixed base and free-free boundary conditions to mimic launch and on-orbit situations. The model is then used to evaluate the magnitudes of on-orbit telescope deflections induced by residual imbalances in spinning reaction wheels. It is shown that, when reaction wheel speeds are below fundamental resonances, the induced jitter is negligible or well below requirements.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the automatic mirror alignment system of the modecleaner and main interferometer of the GEO 600 gravitational wave detector. In order to achieve the required sensitivity of the detector, the eigenmodes of all optical cavities have to be aligned with respect to the incoming beams (or vice versa) and kept aligned for long measuring periods. Moreover the beam spots have to be centred on the mirrors to minimize coupling of residual <b>angular</b> <b>mirror</b> motion into changes of the optical path length. An overview of the principles and setup for the automatic alignment is given, and first results of the modecleaner and 1200 m cavity alignment system are presented, including the error-point spectra of mirror angular motions, which are smaller than 10 (- 8) rad Hz(- 1 / 2) below 10 Hz...|$|E

40|$|An optical {{alignment}} mirror mechanism (AMM) {{has been}} developed with angular positioning accuracy of +/- 0. 2 arcsec. This requires the mirror s linear positioning actuators to have positioning resolutions of +/- 112 nm to enable the mirror to meet the angular tip/tilt accuracy requirement. Demonstrated capabilities are 0. 1 arc-sec <b>angular</b> <b>mirror</b> positioning accuracy, which translates into linear positioning resolutions at the actuator of 50 nm. The mechanism consists of a structure with sets of cross-directional flexures that enable the mirror s tip and tilt motion, a mirror with its kinematic mount, and two linear actuators. An actuator comprises a brushless DC motor, a linear ball screw, and a piezoelectric brake that holds the mirror s position while the unit is unpowered. An interferometric linear position sensor senses the actuator s position. The AMMs were developed for an Astrometric Beam Combiner (ABC) optical bench, {{which is part of}} an interferometer development.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 2 nd June 2018. Laser Doppler vibrometers are now {{well-established}} {{as an effective}} non-contact alternative to traditional contacting transducers. Wide-ranging applications include those where beam steering optics are required to reach locations {{that are difficult to}} access but no attention has yet been given to measurement sensitivity to the vibration of those optics.

A very practical scheme requiring a single correction measurement, from the back-surface of the mirror at the incidence point and aligned with the mirror normal, delivers an error reduction typically in excess of 30 dB. After validation in the laboratory, the scheme is then applied to a genuinely challenging measurement scenario on a single cylinder racing motorcycle.

It can easily be adapted to different wavelengths (584, 834, and 1216 A) using suitable mirror coatings and filters.

40|$|The LAMP (Lightweight Asymmetry and Magnetism Probe) X-ray {{telescope}} is a mission concept {{to measure the}} polarization of X-ray astronomical sources at 250 eV via imaging mirrors that reflect at incidence angles near the polarization angle, i. e., 45 deg. Hence, it will require the adoption of multilayer coatings with a few nanometers d-spacing {{in order to enhance}} the reflectivity. The nickel electroforming technology has already been successfully used to fabricate the high <b>angular</b> resolution imaging <b>mirrors</b> of the X-ray telescopes SAX, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT. We are investigating this consolidated technology as a possible technique to manufacture focusing mirrors for LAMP. Although the very good reflectivity performances of this kind of mirrors were already demonstrated in grazing incidence, the reflectivity and the scattering properties have not been tested directly at the unusually large angle of 45 deg. Other possible substrates are represented by thin glass foils or silicon wafers. In this paper we present the results of the X-ray reflectivity campaign performed at the BEAR beamline of Elettra - Sincrotrone Trieste on multilayer coatings of various composition (Cr/C, Co/C), deposited with different sputtering parameters on nickel, silicon, and glass substrates, using polarized X-rays in the spectral range 240 - 290 eV.

40|$|Homonyms - {{words with}} the same phonological word form but two {{different}} concepts - were used to study the representation of word forms and concepts in the mental lexicon. The connectionist model of speech production by G. S. Dell assumes that homonyms are represented in different concept- and two different lemma-nodes but share the same lexical entry on the phoneme level. The present study investigates mainly two questions: first, whether the separation of word forms and concepts assumed in the theoretical framework {{can also be found}} on the human brain, i. e. whether or not access to word forms and concepts lead to different activations in the brain; secondly, which mechanisms of functional reorganisation of language abilities {{can be found in a}} patient with good recovery from aphasia after a left hemisphere lesion. In an event-related fMRI study 15 healthy young men and one patient were scanned during visual language tasks. The first task focussing on word form knowledge required finding a homonym with each meaning related to one of the two given stimuli. In the second task subjects had to find a conceptual association between two stimuli. The interstimulus interval was 12 seconds long and was divided into sequential time windows of one second each. For each window separate hemodynamic response functions were determined. Solved and unsolved items of the homonym task were analyzed separately. In both tasks - the association and the homonym task - and irrespective of whether or not the homonym will be found later, inferior frontal activation is observed, which is assumed to subserve semantic search. Only the solved items of the homonym task lead to bilateral inferior parietal activation including the supramarginal and <b>angular</b> gyrus, <b>mirroring</b> access to word form knowledge. Interpreting these findings in terms of Dell's model this means that not the different levels of processing, instead the mapping of information from one level onto another can be connected with specific activation in the human brain - mapping semantic features onto lexical nodes happens when inferior frontal activation is observed and mapping two lexical nodes onto one phonological word form is connected with activation of the supramarginal and angular gyrus. The patient shows a comparable pattern of activation considering the separation of word form and conceptual knowledge. During the homonym task he shows perilesional activation of residual substrates, which is in accordance with previous findings concerning functional reorganisation. An additional - most likely compensatory - activation is found in the left primary motor hand area...|$|R
40|$|Lightweight {{and high}} {{resolution}} mirrors {{are needed for}} future space-based X-ray telescopes to achieve advances in high-energy astrophysics. The slumped glass mirror technology in development at NASA GSFC aims to build X-ray mirror modules with an area to mass ratio of approx. 17 sq cm/kg at 1 keV and a resolution of 10 arc-sec Half Power Diameter (HPD) or better at an affordable cost. As the technology nears the performance requirements, additional engineering effort is needed to ensure the modules are compatible with space-flight. This paper describes Flight Mirror Assembly (FMA) designs for several X-ray astrophysics missions studied by NASA and defines generic driving requirements and subsequent verification tests necessary to advance technology readiness for mission implementation. The requirement to perform X-ray testing in a horizontal beam, based on the orientation of existing facilities, is particularly burdensome on the mirror technology, necessitating mechanical over-constraint of the mirror segments and stiffening of the modules {{in order to prevent}} self-weight deformation errors from dominating the measured performance. This requirement, in turn, drives the mass and complexity of the system while limiting the testable angular resolution. Design options for a vertical X-ray test facility alleviating these issues are explored. An alternate mirror and module design using kinematic constraint of the mirror segments, enabled by a vertical test facility, is proposed. The kinematic mounting concept has significant advantages including potential for higher <b>angular</b> resolution, simplified <b>mirror</b> integration, and relaxed thermal requirements. However, it presents new challenges including low vibration modes and imperfections in kinematic constraint. Implementation concepts overcoming these challenges are described along with preliminary test and analysis results demonstrating the feasibility of kinematically mounting slumped glass mirror segments...|$|R
40|$|Future x-ray astronomical {{missions}} require x-ray mirror assemblies {{that provide}} both high angular resolution and large photon collecting area. In addition, as x-ray astronomy undertakes more sensitive sky surveys, a large {{field of view}} is becoming increasingly important as well. Since implementation of these requirements {{must be carried out}} in broad political and economical contexts, any technology that meets these performance requirements must also be financially affordable and can be implemented on a reasonable schedule. In this paper we report on progress of an x-ray optics development program that has been designed to address all of these requirements. The program adopts the segmented optical design, thereby is capable of making both small and large mirror assemblies for missions of any size. This program has five technical elements: (1) fabrication of mirror substrates, (2) coating, (3) alignment, (4) bonding, and (5) mirror module systems engineering and testing. In the past year we have made progress in each of these five areas, advancing the <b>angular</b> resolution of <b>mirror</b> modules from 10. 8 arc-seconds half-power diameter reported (HPD) a year ago to 8. 3 arc-seconds now. These mirror modules have been subjected to and passed all environmental tests, including vibration, acoustic, and thermal vacuum. As such this technology is ready for implementing a mission that requires a 10 -arc-second mirror assembly. Further development {{in the next two years}} would make it ready for a mission requiring a 5 -arc-second mirror assembly. We expect that, by the end of this decade, this technology would enable the x-ray astrophysical community to compete effectively for a major x-ray mission in the 2020 s that would require one or more 1 -arc-second mirror assemblies for imaging, spectroscopic, timing, and survey studies...|$|R
40|$|Direct imaging of Earth-like exoplanets {{requires}} {{high contrast}} imaging capability and high <b>angular</b> resolution. Primary <b>mirror</b> segmentation {{is a key}} technological solution for large-aperture telescopes because it opens the path toward significantly increasing the angular resolution. The segments are kept aligned by an active optics system that must reduce segment misalignments below tens of nm RMS to achieve the high optical quality required for astronomical science programs. The development of cophasing techniques is mandatory {{for the next generation}} of space- and ground-based segmented telescopes, which both share the need for increasing spatial resolution. We propose a new focal plane cophasing sensor that exploits the scientific image of a coronagraphic instrument to retrieve simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments. The self-coherent camera phasing sensor (SCC-PS) adequately combines the SCC properties to segmented telescope architectures with adapted segment misalignment estimators and image processing. An overview of the system architecture, and a thorough performance and sensitivity analysis, including a closed-loop efficiency, are presented by means of numerical simulations. The SCC-PS estimates simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments and corrects them in closed-loop operation. The SCC-PS does not require any a priori on the signal at the segment boundaries or any dedicated optical path. It has a moderate sensitivity to misalignments, virtually none to pupil shear, and is insensitive to segment gaps and edge effects. Primary mirror phasing can be achieved with bright natural guide star. The SCC-PS is a noninvasive concept and an efficient phasing sensor from the image domain. It is an attractive candidate for segment cophasing at the instrument level or alternatively at the telescope level, as usually envisioned in current space- and ground-based observatories.

40|$|Performed in {{this work}} is a {{comprehensive}} theoretical computer analysis of performances inherent to two types of multichannel optical rotary connectors (ORC) of compensation operation based on mirror and prismatic compensators. This analysis relies on exact analytical expressions obtained for light ray paths in ORC models with a mirror compensator made {{in the form of}} bilateral mirror placed between two optical hemispheres and with prismatic compensator made in the form of Dove prism placed between two non-aberrational elliptic lenses. Found in ORC with the mirror compensator is the essential deficiency inherent to all these constructions, which is related with considerable rotary oscillations in the value of optical signals in <b>mirror</b> <b>angular</b> positions when the mirror halves the input light beam. In these mirror positions, the amplitude value of optical signal oscillations exceeds 95 %, and optical losses are higher than – 13 dB, when the rotor turns. One deficiency more in these constructions is also strict technical requirements to the accuracy of making the optical components and mechanisms at the level of 1 … 2 µm. Concerning the ORC construction with a prismatic compensator as well as collimator and focusing lenses common for all the channels, one should note the inadmissibly high optical losses of the signal value (higher than – 30 … 40 dB) in the case of construction with fiber-optic interfaces, and large dimensions and mass in the case of active construction with optoelectronic transducers at the inputs and outputs of ORC. For example, when the number of channels N = 10 the longitudinal dimension of optical transfer channel (prism and lenses) exceeds 300 mm, and this dimension increases with increasing the number of channels. When this dimension is lower than 100 mm, the facility can be equipped with only one optical communication channel containing one LED and one photodiode located on the rotation axis. Optical losses in these constructions cannot be also considered as the satisfactory ones, since the respective loss value is higher than – 18 dB for the number of channels N = 10...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} a 3. 0 meter diameter f/ 1. 5 Liquid Mirror Telescope (LMT) between 1990 and 1994 at the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. We have subsequently operated it since 1995 at the NASA Orbital Debris Observatory (NODO), Cloudcroft, NM. Employing an inexpensive rotating container of mercury as its primary parabolic mirror, the NASA LMT is a cost-effective alternative to telescopes utilizing glass mirrors. We detail criteria for mirror construction including environmental considerations via Hg vapor emission analysis. We describe performance optimization to the NODO site seeing limit of 0. 8 arcseconds FWHM via analysis of perturbations to image quality from <b>mirror</b> <b>angular</b> velocity stability, dynamic balance, rotational axis tilt, and prime focus lateral and tilt displacements. We detail {{the behavior of}} the two prominent mirror surface wave phenomena [...] -spiral and concentric forms. We demonstrate that the former probably results from vorticity in the air boundary layer above the mirror and show diffraction effects from the latter. We describe mirror stabilization in terms of boundary layer theory. The prime focus NASA-LMT utilizes corrective optics yielding a field of 46 arcminute diameter. Utilizing Micro-Channel-Plate (MCP) intensified video cameras we have obtained 750 hours of zenith staring orbital object event data with a limiting object diameter of approximately 1 cm at 1000 km altitude and 0. 1 albedo. We have extended to 17. 75 the lower magnitude limit of optical detections among the telescopes employed for orbital object surveys, further demonstrated the incompleteness of the SATCAT, and corroborated results of RADAR employed in orbital object detection. Utilizing CCDs we have conducted a 135 night broadband and multi-narrowband survey of 20 square degrees of sky at high galactic latitude down to a limiting magnitude of ∼ 22. 0. The survey data will yield information on object morphology, spectral classifications, and large-scale structure to a redshift (z) of 0. 5 with an accuracy of Deltaz ≤ 0. 02.

40|$|Objective: Overuse {{injuries}} in violinists {{are a problem}} that has been primarily analyzed {{through the use of}} questionnaires. Simultaneous 3 D motion analysis and EMG to measure muscle activity has been suggested as a quantitative technique to explore this problem by identifying movement patterns and muscular demands which may predispose violinists to overuse injuries. This multi-disciplinary analysis technique has, so far, had limited use in the music world. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use it to characterize the demands of a violin bowing task. Subjects: Twelve injury-free violinists volunteered for the study. The subjects were assigned to a novice or expert group based on playing experience, as determined by questionnaire. Design and Settings: Muscle activity and movement patterns were assessed while violinists played five bowing cycles (one bowing cycle = one down-bow + one up-bow) on each string (G, D, A, E), at a pulse of 4 beats per bow and 100 beats per minute. Measurements: An upper extremity model created using coordinate data from markers placed on the right acromion process, lateral epicondyle of the humerus and ulnar styloid was used to determine minimum and maximum joint angles, ranges of motion (ROM) and angular velocities at the shoulder and elbow of the bowing arm. Muscle activity in right anterior deltoid, biceps brachii and triceps brachii was assessed during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and during the playing task. Data were analysed for significant differences across the strings and between experience groups. Results: Elbow flexion/extension ROM was similar across strings for both groups. Shoulder flexion/extension ROM increaslarger for the experts. <b>Angular</b> velocity changes <b>mirrored</b> changes in ROM. Deltoid was the most active of the muscles assessed (20 % MVC) and displayed a pattern of constant activation to maintain shoulder abduction. Biceps and triceps were less active (4 - 12 % MVC) and showed a more periodic 'on and off pattern. Novices' muscle activity was higher in all cases. Experts' muscle activity showed a consistent pattern across strings, whereas the novices were more irregular. The agonist-antagonist roles of biceps and triceps during the bowing motion were clearly defined in the expert group, but not as apparent in the novice group. Conclusions: Bowing movement appears to be controlled by the shoulder rather than the elbow as shoulder ROM changed across strings while elbow ROM remained the same. Shoulder injuries are probably due to repetition as the muscle activity required for the movement is small. Experts require a smaller amount of muscle activity to perform the movement, possibly due to more efficient muscle activation patterns as a result of practice. This quantitative multidisciplinary approach to analysing violinists' movements can contribute to fuller understanding of both playing demands and injury mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} phase {{conjugation}} by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is presented {{with emphasis on}} the influence of limiting factors, such as aperture and polarization losses, spatial coherence and saturation of the incident wave on the quality of phase conjugation, as well as the application of SBS to two practically interesting configurations, namely: the loop phase-conjugated mirror and intracavity-SBS-cell phase-conjugated oscillator. The thesis can be divided into two parts. The first one covers the period from 1982 to 1995 when I was with P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute of Russian Academy of Science. Chapters Two, Three, and Four describe the research done in that time. These chapters are not just overviews of the subject literature found in most of theses, but also represent early original works by me and my colleagues. Credits go to Prof. N. G. Basov, Mr. D. A. Glazkov, Mr. A. A. Gordeev, Mr. A. B. Mironov, Mr. S. I. Mikhailov, and Dr. I. G. Zubarev for being my co-authors and collaborators. The second part of the thesis covers the period from 1997 to 2000 when I was a Ph. D. student at The University of Adelaide. Chapters Five and Six present the results obtained for these last three years. Credits go to Prof. J. Munch for being my Ph. D. supervisor. The thesis consists of seven chapters. Chapter One presents the research objectives of the thesis, puts the work in context with the literature and highlights other results of the author's research done in the field of phase conjugation but not included in this thesis. Chapter Two is devoted to a theoretical study of spatial coherence and pump saturation in stimulated scattering. The model developed leads to a significant simplification of the dynamical equations, which can then be analyzed for arbitrary relations between the characteristic lifetimes of the respective oscillations and the reciprocal width of the pump spectrum. The space-time structure of the scattered Stokes radiation is computed for different numbers of the spectral components of the pump. A comparative study of the collinear and counter propagation interactions of a Stokes field with pump radiation is carried out. A theoretical investigation of stimulated scattering of spatially inhomogeneous radiation under saturation condition is also made in Chapter Two. A system of kinetic equations describing the interaction between the pump radiation and Stokes waves, correlated and uncorrelated with the exciting field, is derived and solved. A quantitative criterion is derived for the quality of phase conjugation for two practical cases of the Stokes radiation generation. Chapter Three contains investigations of the influence of polarization and aperture losses on the performance of phase-conjugating mirror systems. The losses are described by means of the overlap integral. They lead to the appearance of unremovable noise in the background of the reproduced radiation. Different possible situations are analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. Chapter Four is concerned with the generation of Stokes waves in the loop application of a phase conjugate <b>mirror.</b> <b>Angular</b> selectivity the reflectivity threshold, and the duration of the linear stage of the development of lasing are investigated experimentally. Near-field and far-field spatial distributions are measured for different lengths of the loop. A method of phase conjugation with a high energy efficiency is implemented. Chapter Five investigates a phase conjugate oscillator with an intra-cavity stimulated-Brillouin-scattering cell. The oscillator resonator design is developed for a stable single-pulse emission. Dynamics of the Q-switch pulse development is analyzed. An interferometric technique is used for the measurement of coherence length of the output pulse at different levels of the pump energy. Coherence length limits are estimated and compared with the experimental results. In Chapter Six, a method of improvement of the output performance of a phase conjugate oscillator is described. An additional extra-cavity stimulated-Brillouin-scattering cell creates a master oscillator + power amplifier configuration from a single laser rod. This design allows improvement of temporal characteristics of the laser emission as well as an increase in the peak output power. The beam quality is measured {{in the course of the}} experiment by using an autocalibrating technique. Finally, conclusions drawn from the work performed in this thesis are presented in Chapter Seven. In the Appendices, I include various derivations plus full list of my publications and one reprint for every chapter (chapters Two to Six). Thesis (Ph. D.)
