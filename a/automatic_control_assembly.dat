In order to promote the rapid development of the mechanized production in China, the <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> of large-scale machinery is required.

The experimental results indicated that carrying out <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> of the large-scale mechanical arm according to algorithm proposed in this paper could improve the accuracy of the <b>automatic</b> <b>control.</b> ...|$|R
