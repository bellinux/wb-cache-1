40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact that teacher attitudes and {{experiences}} have on their understandings {{of the social and}} emotional characteristics <b>and</b> needs of <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children. It addresses the issues within Aotearoa New Zealand Primary school settings. The study used a mixed methodology approach. Quantitative data was collected in the form of questionnaires to collect information from a range of participants and to identify potential participants for individual interviews. More in-depth qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with four teachers. The findings suggest that many teachers are uncertain about the social and emotional characteristics <b>and</b> needs of <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children. Teachers expressed positive attitudes towards <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children while acknowledging their lack of personal knowledge about <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented education. The findings also identified teachers‘ frustrations at barriers affecting their ability to support <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children‘s social and emotional needs in their classroom programmes, including, limited personal knowledge and skills, lack of professional development, lack of time to spend with <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children, and school directed priorities for meeting the needs of other children. The findings of this study have implications for teachers wanting to support <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children, educators interested in the social and emotional needs of <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children, and those responsible for <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented education (GATE) programmes and GATE professional development. It would seem that it is highly desirable for all teachers to have professional development in <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented education, in order to better understand social and emotional aspects, and thereby provide a more supportive environment where <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented children can learn and grow...|$|R

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this case}} study was to {{investigate}} the current <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented provision put in place by the Physical Education Department. Three teaching professionals within Physical Education were interviewed, alongside a focus group of ten previously identified <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented students (identified by the Physical Education department) within Physical Education. The qualitative data collected was transcribed and coded accordingly, allowing for the theoretical framework of rhetoric vs reality to be used when examining the data. The study found that both teachers <b>and</b> identified <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented students share obvious views on the successful and unsuccessful elements to the <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented provision currently in place. Both teachers and pupils agree that they already see a great amount of challenge and development within lessons. However, all participants agree that in order to continuously develop these students, there must be extra-curricular provisions provided which are solely directed towards the <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented in PE. Recommendations for future research would include a comparative research study looking at two or three different school approaches on <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented provision, in order to enhance their own <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented provision...|$|R

Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but lost 1–0 to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first team place late in the season after fatigue began to affect his form, and was only named as a substitute for the final before he came on for Radford after 73 minutes.

That April, the Duveen Brothers, less {{affected}} by the 1929 stock market crash than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in cash, for the painting and sold it immediately to Mellon. A dealer usually {{had to go through}} the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the Nativity is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via Marconi cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America.

5|$|The {{discovery}} {{was reported in}} September in Courrier de l'Égypte, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day {{be the key to}} deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian Demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.|$|E
5|$|As in Forza Motorsport 3, {{there is}} a career mode for players to complete, which sees players racing at {{multiple}} locations around the world. This is known as World Tour Mode in Forza Motorsport 4, previously known as Season Play in Forza Motorsport 3. However, one new feature that appears in Forza Motorsport 4 is the game's ability to adapt the difficulty as the player progresses through the career, and collect a trend of data {{to see how well}} they perform. This allows AI drivers to change and upgrade their cars automatically to suit the player's driving abilities. There are several types of races besides the standard format. Forza Motorsport 4 includes the original bumper-to-bumper races, but also has drift, autocross, and multiple-heat races. Unlike in Forza Motorsport 3 where players had no choice over which car they received after leveling up, in Forza Motorsport 4 players are now able to choose one out of several cars as a prize, which are automatically upgraded to the high end of their class. Players are able to import their Forza Motorsport 3 profiles into Forza Motorsport 4. This gives them the ability to transfer a certain number of in-game credits <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> cars into their new garage. The allowed number transferred is based on how long they have played the game and how many cars and credits they have. Players have the option to create car clubs and share cars in their garages within that club. Previous games in the series were limited to eight cars on the track, however Forza Motorsport 4 supports 16 player racing online, and two players offline.|$|E
