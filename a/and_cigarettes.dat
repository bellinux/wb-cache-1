In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol <b>and</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate <b>and</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track pinch point.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between the individual factor of stress <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking behavior <b>and</b> also determine the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between stress <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking behavior among adolescents in Kerman, Iran. A quantitative research method was employed. The samples included three hundred current smoker adolescents between the ages of 15 to 18. The data were collected by means of self-administered questionnaires and then analyzed by AMOS software. The direct structural model was employed to determine the path relationships between the individual factor of stress <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking behavior. In addition, a multi-group analysis approach was applied to assess the moderating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between stress <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking behavior among adolescents. The results of testing the structural equation model revealed that there is a positive significant relationship between the individual factor of stress <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking behavior. It was also found that self-efficacy significantly moderates the effects of stress on the cigarette smoking behavior among adolescents. The paper proposes some suggestions in order t...|$|R

An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, <b>and</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine <b>and</b> <b>cigarettes</b> with Dargie.|$|E
