5|$|A {{district}} {{is governed by}} a District Collector, who is better known as a District Magistrate (DM) {{in the state of}} West Bengal. A DM is an officer from either Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or West Bengal Civil Service (WBCS), and is appointed by the State Government of West Bengal. Each {{district is}} divided into subdivisions, except the Kolkata district, which contains urban area only, administered by Kolkata Municipal Corporation. A subdivision is governed by a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), better known as a Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO). Other than urban units such as town municipalities, a subdivision contains 'community development blocks' (also known as CD blocks or blocks). <b>A</b> <b>block</b> consists of urban units such as census towns and rural units called gram panchayats. <b>A</b> <b>block</b> is administered by <b>a</b> <b>Block</b> Development Officer (BDO), who is appointed by the Government of West Bengal.|$|E

5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block cellular automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is reversible, is easy: for <b>a</b> <b>block</b> cellular automaton to be reversible it is necessary and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton is itself reversible. When <b>a</b> <b>block</b> cellular automaton is reversible, the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as <b>a</b> <b>block</b> cellular automaton with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E
50|$|In {{a finite}} {{projective}} plane π of order n, <b>a</b> <b>blocking</b> set is <b>a</b> {{set of points}} of π which every line intersects and which contains no line completely. Under this definition, if B is <b>a</b> <b>blocking</b> set, then complementary set of points, π\B is also <b>a</b> <b>blocking</b> set. <b>A</b> <b>blocking</b> set B is minimal if the removal of any point of B leaves a set which is not <b>a</b> <b>blocking</b> set. <b>A</b> <b>blocking</b> set of smallest size is called a committee. Every committee is <b>a</b> minimal <b>blocking</b> set, but not all minimal blocking sets are committees. Blocking sets exist in all projective planes except for the smallest projective plane of order 2, the Fano plane.|$|R

5|$|The Critters rule is <b>a</b> <b>block</b> {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks.

Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E

5|$|For <b>a</b> <b>block</b> {{cellular}} automaton, testing reversibility is also easy: the automaton is reversible if {{and only}} if the transition function on the blocks of the automaton is invertible, and in this case the reverse automaton has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E

This earned him a second straight Ivy League Player of the Week on December 17, 2012 That week he matched Bill Bradley as the only two Tigers with 1300 career points and 600 career rebounds. On December 20 and 22 against Rider and Bucknell, Hummer posted 15 points, 7 rebound, 5 assists, 2 steals and <b>a</b> <b>block</b> and then 17 points, 8 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 blocks.

On January 5, Hummer tied his career high with 28 points and added 6 rebounds, 1 assist, 2 steals and <b>a</b> <b>block</b> against Elon.

40|$|AbstractA semioval in a {{projective}} plane Π {{is a set}} S {{of points}} such that for every pointP∈S, there exists a unique line ℓ of Π such thatℓ∩S= { P }. In other words, at every point of S, there exists a unique tangent line. <b>A</b> <b>blocking</b> set in Π is a set B of points such that every line ofΠ contains at least one point of B, but is not entirely contained in B. Combining these notions, we obtain the concept of <b>a</b> <b>blocking</b> semioval, <b>a</b> set of points in a projective plane which is both a semioval and <b>a</b> <b>blocking</b> set.
