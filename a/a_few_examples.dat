5|$|Following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east, Hellenistic {{influence}} on Indian art was far-ranging. In {{the area of}} architecture, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> of the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jandial temple near Taxila. Several examples of capitals displaying Ionic influences {{can be seen as}} far as Patna, especially with the Pataliputra capital, dated to the 3rd century BC. The Corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gandhara, especially through Indo-Corinthian capitals.|$|E

A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as Colha in northern Belize and has been dated to c.880600 BC, in the Middle Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} {{oxidation}} state for manganese is +2, {{which has a}} pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as manganese(II) sulfate (MnSO4) and manganese(II) chloride (MnCl2). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite (manganese(II) carbonate). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state {{because of the high}} pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II). There are no spin-allowed d–d transitions in manganese(II), explaining why manganese(II) compounds are typically pale to colorless.|$|E

5|$|Many American {{cities and}} towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> of diversity in American music. Modern day music is heavily influenced by previous and present African-American music genres.|$|E
5|$|The M19 MGMC {{served in}} Europe in World War II with the U.S. Army. By {{the time the}} M19 arrived, the Luftwaffe had been driven from the skies by Allied air power, so the M19 found use as an assault gun, which was a role it {{performed}} very well. It was never delivered to other countries for Lend-Lease or the Military Aid Program (though <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> were transferred to the newly established JGSDF in 1954). It also served in the Korean War, for the same purpose as it was used in World War II. It {{was used in the}} defense against the North Korean forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting and later fighting in Korea. The 40mm guns were especially effective against Chinese mass infantry charges in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements {{can be described as}} dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E

5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh drew, {{and painted}} with watercolours while at school, but only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> survive and the authorship of some has been challenged. When {{he took up}} art as an adult, he began at an {{elementary}} level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did {{not live up to}} expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures– highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (cave hyena subspecies) is {{depicted}} in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>examples</b> of Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's steeped profile, {{it is thought that}} the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a hyena. In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and {{is depicted in}} profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ariège shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal’s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the spotted hyena, as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that evokes a smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a spotted hyena based on its broad muzzle and long neck.|$|E
