5000|$|In contrast, the eye {{moves to}} look through various parts of a <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> as it shifts its gaze, some {{of which can be}} as much as several centimeters off of the optical center. Thus, despite the eye's {{dispersive}} properties, the <b>corrective</b> <b>lens's</b> dispersion cannot be dismissed. People who are sensitive to the effects of chromatic aberrations, or who have stronger prescriptions, or who often look off the lens’s optical center, or who prefer larger <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> sizes may be impacted by chromatic aberration. To minimize chromatic aberration: ...|$|R
50|$|These {{glasses are}} not as {{tailored}} to {{the specific needs of}} the patient. A difference in refractive error between the eyes or presence of astigmatism will not be accounted for. The use of improper <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> may not help or could even exacerbate binocular vision disorders. Over the counter glasses do not usually correct for distance vision. Eyecare professionals (optometrists and ophthalmologists) are trained to determine the specific <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> that will provide the clearest, most comfortable and most efficient vision, avoiding double vision and maximizing binocularity. They can test to see if over the counter <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> are appropriate.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> is a lens worn {{in front}} of the eye, mainly used to treat myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. The goal is to bring vision up to 20/20 vision or as close to this as possible. Glasses or [...] "spectacles" [...] are <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> worn on the face a short {{distance}} {{in front of}} the eye. Contact lenses are worn directly {{on the surface of the}} eye. Intraocular lenses are surgically implanted most commonly after cataract removal, but recently for purely refractive purposes. Myopia (short sightedness) requires a divergent lens, whereas hyperopia (far sightedness) requires convergent lens.|$|R
