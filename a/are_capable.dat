5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|As {{interactions}} between proteins are reversible, and depend {{heavily on the}} availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the {{interactions between}} specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.|$|E
