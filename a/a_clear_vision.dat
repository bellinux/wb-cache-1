5|$|At the 1920 elections, {{domestic}} interests aligned {{against those}} of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, gives him {{the credit for the}} victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision,</b> principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn's {{hardware}} {{was new to}} the team, and it {{was their}} first attempt at creating an original environment. It was also Futatsugi's first year working as a full developer at Sega, so he was only able to do simple things while having <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of what he wanted, which helped him to keep the overall style pure, with stark and minimalist cutscenes. Similarly, Iwade kept the enemies easy to understand visually, with simple shapes, and this overall simple style ended up fitting well with the Saturn's hardware. Then, Team Andromeda set to work on elaborating an extensive back story, and Futatsugi, to be original and to avoid using Japanese or English, {{went so far as}} to create a new language for the game: a mix of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. This was apparently inspired by the anime The Wings of Honneamise, of which team members were fans and which also features an invented language.|$|E

25|$|The School of Environmental Studies was {{designed}} {{in a manner}} very different from most schools.

25|$|The {{game was}} also the first and only in the {{original}} series under the direction of LucasArts that never actually took place on Monkey Island. However, it is revealed in the following game, The Curse of Monkey Island, that the Carnival of the Damned seen in the LeChuck's Revenges conclusion was actually part of Monkey Island. The game's creator, Ron Gilbert, departed from Lucas Arts after the second game. He stated on his blog that he had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> what the ending in the second game meant, how the story will develop from here, and that the story development Lucas Arts came up with in his absence was not close to his ideas.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Sharif {{announced}} that it would open unconditional talks with the Taliban, declaring them stakeholders rather than terrorists. The PML-N's conservative hardliners also chose to blame the US and NATO for causing terrorism in Pakistan. The peace effort was encountering problems before it had ever really begun. The Pakistani Taliban's Supreme Council released demands for a cease-fire, to also include the release of all its imprisoned militants and the withdrawal of the Pakistani military from all tribal regions. Former and current government officials criticised Sharif for not yet laying out <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of how the country should handle its more than 40 militant groups, many of them made up of violent Islamic extremists.|$|E
25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must articulate <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E

500|$|Carter also {{directed}} the episode; initially, the episode {{was supposed to}} have been helmed by another individual, but no one was ever selected. At the last minute, Carter took on the role. Due to time constraints, Carter was writing whole parts of the script while the episode was being filmed. Many of the cast and crew were pleased with Carter's directing. Gillian Anderson said that she thought [...] "Chris has directed some of our best episodes. He's very even tempered, and he's quiet and gentle and quite nice to have as a director, because that energy can't help but pervade the rest of the set [...] He's got <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision,</b> and he's good at communicating that." [...] Annabeth Gish noted that Carter's directing was [...] "very meticulous" [...] and that he [...] "knows exactly what he wants".|$|E
500|$|Another legend {{tells how}} Zowe Palep, the architect, {{had a vision}} in a dream after the Zhabdrung ordered him to sleep under a small {{structure}} which contained a statue of the Buddha, known as Dzong Chug [...] "small dzong". In his dream, prompted by the psychic powers of the Zhabdrung, he had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of a palace for Guru Rinpoche. The vision was imprinted on the architect's mind, enabling him to conceive the plan for the dzong without putting the vision on paper and to build it. On {{the basis of the}} dream vision of the architect, the building of the dzong was started in 1637 and completed in 1638, at the place where the Dzong Chug had existed. During this period, Ngawang Namgyal became the first leader of a unified Bhutan, following his concerted efforts to unify the country into one unit.|$|E

500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment".

She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me."

500|$|Composer Ramin Djawadi {{had been}} a fan of the {{character}} Iron Man as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes [...] "that actually don’t have any superpowers". After Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film, Djawadi sought out the role himself. Favreau had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>vision</b> of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero. Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions, [...] and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score. The film also features a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and Rick Boston. A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by Lions Gate Records on April 29, 2008.|$|E

As far as transfer of power was concerned, Mubarak said [...] "I have seen that it is required to delegate the powers and authorities of the president to the vice president as dictated in the constitution,". The constitutional article was used to transfer powers if the president was [...] "temporarily" [...] unable to carry out his duties and did not require his resignation. He also said he would request six constitutional amendments and that he would lift emergency laws when security in the country permitted. Mubarak said he would stay in the country and was [...] "adamant to continue to shoulder my responsibility to protect the constitution and safeguard the interests of the people... until power is handed over to those elected in September by the people in free and fair elections in which all the guarantees of transparencies will be secured." ...|$|E
