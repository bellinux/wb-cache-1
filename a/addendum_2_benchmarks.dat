In contrast to Immanuel Kant who claimed that free and moral action amounts to pure reason alone being the cause of action, Adorno believes that a physical impulse is required for action to take place.

In that there is always a physical component involved in action, Adorno believes that some materially motivated action can be morally good. Specifically, it is the impulsive response to suffering and physical pain that Adorno believes is morally good because, as I suggest, it is only by so responding that the Holocaust can be prevented from happening again...|$|R

Calculations with the computer code DORT, based on the discrete-ordinates method, were performed with three multigroup libraries based on ENDF/B-VI: BUGLE- 93, SAILOR- 95 and BUGLE- 96.

In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{design of a}} multi-threaded QEMU, called PQEMU, which can {{effectively}} deploy multiple emulated virtual CPUs on the underlying multi-core machine. The main idea of the design is to add a parallel emulation model to the execution flow of QEMU. To evaluate the design, we emulate an ARM 11 MPCore by running PQEMU on a quad-core x 86 i 7 system and use SPLASH- <b>2</b> as <b>benchmarks.</b> The experimental {{results show that the}} performance of PQEMU is, on average, 3. 8 times faster than that of QEMU and is scalable on the quad-core i 7 system for the SPLASH- <b>2</b> <b>benchmark</b> suite. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{multiprocessor}} prefetch {{scheme is}} described in which a miss {{is followed by a}} prefetch of a group of lines, a neighborhood, surrounding the demand-fetched line. The neighborhood is based on the data address and the past behavior of the instruction that missed the cache. A neighborhood for an instruction is constructed by recording the o#sets of addresses that subsequently miss. This neighborhood prefetching can exploit sequential access as can sequential prefetch and can to some extent exploit stride access, as can stride prefetch. Unlike stride and sequential prefetch it can support irregular access patterns. Neighborhood prefetching was compared to adaptive sequential prefetching using execution-driven simulation. Results show more useful prefetches and lower execution time for neighborhood prefetching for six of eight SPLASH- <b>2</b> <b>benchmarks.</b> On eight SPLASH- <b>2</b> <b>benchmarks</b> the average normalized execution time is less than 0. 9, for three benchmarks, less than 0. 8. 1.

40|$|We {{present a}} new lock-free {{parallel}} algorithm for computing betweenness centrality of massive small-world networks. With minor {{changes to the}} data structures, our algorithm also achieves better spatial cache locality compared to previous approaches. Betweenness centrality is a key algorithm kernel in HPCS SSCA# <b>2,</b> a <b>benchmark</b> extensively used to evaluate the performance of emerging high-performance computing architectures for graph-theoretic computations. We design optimized implementations of betweenness centrality and the SSCA# <b>2</b> <b>benchmark</b> for two hardware multithreaded systems: a Cray XMT system with the Threadstorm processor, and a single-socket Sun multicore server with the UltraSPARC T 2 processor. For a small-world network of 134 million vertices and 1. 073 billion edges, the 16 -processor XMT system and the 8 -core Sun Fire T 5120 server achieve TEPS scores (an algorithmic performance count for the SSCA# <b>2</b> <b>benchmark)</b> of 160 million and 90 million respectively, which corresponds to more than a 2 X performance improvement over the previous parallel implementations. To better characterize the performance of these multithreaded systems, we correlate the SSCA# 2 performance results with data from the memory-intensive STREAM and RandomAccess benchmarks. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our implementation to analyze massive real-world datasets by computing approximate betweenness centrality for a large-scale IMDb movie-actor network...|$|R
40|$|We outline a {{benchmark}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) intensity system with tradable permits for the aviation industry that will incent in-sector emission abatement opportunities that {{cost less than}} the social cost of carbon (SCC). The system sets benchmark emission intensities (CO 2 emissions per revenue ton kilometer) by route group and facilitates flexibility in meeting the benchmarks by allowing airlines to sell permits if they operate more efficiently than the benchmarks, and buy permits {{if they do not}} meet the <b>benchmarks.</b> The CO <b>2</b> <b>benchmark</b> system could operate concurrently with existing measures to mitigate aviation CO 2 emissions, will reduce the number of offsets needed to achieve carbon-neutral growth, and provide another (optional) lever to address fairness issues in climate regulations.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{two-stage}} congestion-driven placement flow. First, during each refinement stage of our multilevel global placement framework, we replace cells {{based on the}} wirelength weighted by congestion level to reduce the routing demands of congested regions. Second, after the global placement stage, we allocate appropriate amounts of white space into {{different regions of the}} chip according to a congestion map by shifting cut lines in a top-down fashion and apply a detailed placer to legalize the placement and further reduce the half-perimeter wirelength while preserving the distribution of white space. Experimental results show that our placement flow can achieve the best routability with the shortest routed wirelength among publicly available placement tools on IBM v <b>2</b> <b>benchmarks.</b> Our placer obtains 100 % successful routings on 16 IBM v <b>2</b> <b>benchmarks</b> with shorter routed wirelengths by 3. 1 % to 24. 5 % compared to other placement tools. Moreover, our white space allocation approach can significantly improve the routability of placements generated by other placement tools.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the MOLEN &rho;&mu;-coded processor which comprises hardwired and microcoded reconfigurable units. At {{the expense of}} three new instructions, the proposed mechanisms allow instructions, entire pieces of code, or their combination to execute in a reconfigurable manner. The reconfiguration of the hardware and the execution on the reconfigured hardware are performed by &rho;-microcode (an extension of the classical microcode to allow reconfiguration capabilities). We include fixed and pageable microcode hardware features to extend the flexibility and improve the performance. The scheme allows partial reconfiguration and includes caching mechanisms for non-frequently used reconfiguration and execution microcode. Using simulations, we establish the performance potential of the proposed processor assuming the JPEG and MPEG- <b>2</b> <b>benchmarks,</b> the ALTERA APEX 20 K boards for the implementation, and a hardwired superscalar processor. After implementation, cycle time estimations and normalization, our simulations indicate that the execution cycles of the superscalar machine can be reduced by 30 % for the JPEG benchmark and by 32 % for the MPEG- <b>2</b> <b>benchmark</b> using the proposed processor organization...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} interest, as of late, in the quantum-corrected {{form of the}} Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy. The consensus viewpoint is that the leading-order correction should be a logarithm of the horizon area; however, {{the value of the}} logarithmic prefactor remains a point of notable controversy. Very recently, Hod has employed statistical arguments that constrain this prefactor to be a non-negative integer. In the current paper, we invoke some independent considerations to argue that the "best guess" for the prefactor might simply be zero. Significantly, this value complies with the prior prediction and, moreover, seems suggestive of some fundamental symmetry.

40|$|It is the {{consensus}} that, {{as a result}} of the extra constraints placed on working memory, texts written in a second language (L 2) are usually of lower quality than texts written in the first language (L 1) by the same writer. However, no method is currently available for quantifying the quality difference between L 1 and L 2 texts. In the present study, we tested a rating procedure for enabling quality judgments of L 1 and L 2 texts on a single scale. Two main features define this procedure: 1) raters are bilingual or near native users of both the L 1 and L 2; 2) ratings are performed with L 1 and L <b>2</b> <b>benchmark</b> texts. Direct comparisons of observed L 1 and L 2 scores are only warranted if the ratings with L 1 and L <b>2</b> <b>benchmarks</b> are parallel tests and if the ratings are reliable.

Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) indicate that, while score variances are large, there is a relatively large added L 2 effect: in the investigated population, L 2 text scores were much lower than L 1 text scores.
