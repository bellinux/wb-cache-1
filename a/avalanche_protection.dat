40|$|It {{has been}} said that runout {{distance}} depends on altitude, aspect and angle, but theclimate is of great importance. The arctic dessert with drifting snow creates dense windpackedslabs over weaker layers of depth hoar. The long runout data has been collectedand analyzed into a calibrated α - β model. Calibration of the α - β-model has been conducted to get the best fit to the observed Svalbard avalanches. The runout distance depends also of the topography of the avalanche path, the inclination and size of the release area. Different avalanche runout models are used to calculate runout distance for possible release areas around Lunckefjell. The parameters used in the models are collected formfield investigations and snow pit investigations in the respective slopes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{snow cover}} {{distribution}} in alpine terrain {{is known to}} be highly influenced by the local wind field. In this study the correlation between different wind conditions and patterns of snow deposition was analysed for a potential avalanche release zone. For {{the purpose of this study}} the spatial distribution of snow depth was measured using terrestrial laser scanning technology. Showing an accuracy of +/- 5 cm and a high resolution of 24 cm (at a distance of 800 m) this measuring system is able to capture the major snow drift zones. As the meteorological conditions were known for the different snow fall events very high resolution wind fields (5 m horizontal resolution) were simulated with an atmospheric model ARPS (Advanced Regional Prediction System). The modelled wind fields combined with a very simple classification of snow conditions were correlated against the spatial snow depth data measured by terrestrial laser scanner before and after respective events. The authors suggest the combination of both methods as valuable tool in terms of <b>avalanche</b> forecast and <b>protection...</b>|$|R

40|$|Forest {{management}} {{objectives for}} {{private and public}} forest landowners were mostly well defined until the late 20 th century. Until then, global changes were occurring slowly and had a small impact on forest management, especially in the northern hemisphere. Forest management was generally focused on a single dominant objective, most commonly timber or revenue production in a sustainable manner. Even notable exceptions to the prominence of timber production as the primary goal had a clear defined purpose, such as <b>avalanche</b> or landslide <b>protection</b> in steep, alpine regions. Hand {{in hand with the}} focus on single objec-tives was a dominant emphasis on increasing efficiency by simplifying and homogenizing forest structures and operations (Puettmann et al., 2009). Overall, foresters were quite suc-cessful at improving productivity in intensively managed operations. In contrast, the current diversity of owner-ship objectives and public viewpoints about forests (e. g. the increasing concern about biodiversity) and the accelerating changes in global climate, species invasions, and market forces are forcing a complete re-evaluation of forest management.

40|$|ABSTRACT: February 1999 will {{be known}} in Swiss natural {{disaster}} history for its record quantities of snow, for more than 1300 harmful avalanches, 17 deaths, cut-off valleys, blocked transport routes, and for total damage costs of over 600 million Swiss francs. Three intensive snow fall periods accompanied by stormy north-westerly winds brought over 5 m of new snow within one month to the northern side of the Swiss Alps. This amount of new snow in 30 days has a periodicity of approximately 80 - 100 years in the central {{northern part of the}} Swiss Alps and 40 - 50 years in the other parts of the Swiss Alps. A com-parable catastrophic avalanche I?eriod of similar size dates happened only in 1951, where 98 people were killed. The avalanche winter 1951 was the beginning of modern avalanche defense measures for the next five decades in terms of paravalanche constructions, avalanche hazard mapping, avalanche warning and silvicultural measures to maintain the protection forest. Considering the growth in public and private in-vestments in mountainous areas, the enormous increase in mobility of the people and the exponentially rising communication needs over the last fifty years, these large investments in <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> measures over the last 50 years have paid off.

We demonstrate how shocks are formed when dilatational flow states merge into compacting states and show that shock formation is an essential mechanism in flows against obstructions. We finally apply the theory of similitude to the design of a projected <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> structure of the Schneefernerhaus at the Zugspitze. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Forested {{areas are}} {{less prone to}} snow avalanches, due to the trees ' {{influence}} on snow accumulation, snow pack layering, energy balance and the armoring effect of the trees. Crown cover, tree dimensions and forest density influence the protection effect of the forest. A plan for preserving forest – and re-establishing forest after logging or after forest fires, avalanches or landslides, can potentially reduce avalanche danger. Many places in the European Alps and in North America protection forest is recognized as a mitigation method against natural hazards. In Norway the effect of forest is less studied.

30|$|Health {{and safety}} {{considerations}} are always important {{during and after}} partial harvesting operations due to concerns about the stability of branches and retained trees (Schaetzl et al. 1989). The presence of dead branches or forked trunks leads to safety concerns, but can {{be taken into account}} when selecting residual trees. Past scarring, possibly during earlier harvest operations, can also provide indications of possible trunk rot and thus the likelihood of tree fall (Matlack et al. 1993). Training can also reduce workplace safety risks. For example, the injury rate dropped - rather than increased - when variable retention harvesting replaced clearcutting in coastal British Columbia, because of strong organizational focus on worker safety. In contrast, at a larger scale, forests with continuous cover are preferred because of their safety benefits for <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> (Bebi et al. 2009) and protection from landslides (Dhakal and Sidle 2003; Noguchi et al. 2011).|$|E

40|$|Questions on optimum {{protection}} measures {{have always been}} bound to economic considerations. This involves a comprehensive investigation {{and analysis of the}} effect of <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> measures with an appropriate concept of risk, including the avalanche danger area and use of the area. Technical and economic methods and analysis are applied in methodical procedures in order to arrive at an assessment model for <b>avalanche</b> <b>protection</b> projects. From the technical point of view, the application of general risk analysis methodology and its adaptation to specific circumstances related to avalanche hazards are in the foreground. The quantitative risk magnitudes are supplemented by the aspects of risk awareness, in particular of risk acceptance and risk aversion. The avalanche risk of specific protection projects in the sense of an expected annual value of damage is calculated as part of the total potential damage. The result of this risk analysis is shown in a quantitative risk- diagram with the outset risk without safety measures, the remaining risk and the risk reduction. By comparing the annual costs for measures and the expected risk reduction, it is possible to make comparisons between measures with a short-term and long-term effect. The targeted project selection for this paper takes the expected variability of the efficiency into account {{in order to be able}} to de-fine the economical limits. It is also possible to deduce marginal costs which, in the past, were applied to prevent a statistical death occurrence. 1 METHODS OF QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 1. 1 Risk concept and avalanche risk A risk situation can be related to a single person (individual), to the danger area of an avalanche or to other limiting factors (collective, perimeter). The analysis of a risk situation (Kaplan/Garrick 1981) should provide ans-wers to three questions: What (kind of damage) can occur?(Scenario, S) How often will this damage occur?(Probability, P(s)) What is the extent of this damage?(Extent, As) In general, the risk of a scenario can be written (e. g.

40|$|Avalanches pose a {{significant}} problem in most mountain regions of Russia. The constant growth of economic activity, and therefore the increased avalanche hazard, in the North Caucasus region lead to demand {{for the development of}} large-scale avalanche risk assessment methods.

The requirement of natural hazard risk assessments is determined by the Federal Law of the Russian Federation (Federal Law 21. 12. 1994  N  68 -FZ, 2016).

The suggested method includes the formulas to calculate collective and individual avalanche risk. The results of risk analysis are shown in quantitative data {{that can be used to}} determine levels of avalanche risk (appropriate, acceptable and inappropriate) and to suggest methods to decrease the individual risk to an acceptable level or better.
