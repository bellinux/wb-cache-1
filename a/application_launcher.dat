25|$|New Plasma applets include applets {{for leaving}} {{messages}} on a locked screen, previewing files, switching desktop Activity, monitoring news feeds, and utilities like the pastebin applet, the calendar, timer, special character selector, a QuickLaunch widget, {{and a system}} monitor, among many others. The Plasma workspace can now load Google Gadgets. Plasma widgets can be written in Ruby and Python. Support for applets written in JavaScript and Mac OS X dashboard widgets has been further improved. Theming improvements in the Task Bar, <b>Application</b> <b>Launcher,</b> System Tray and most other Plasma components streamline {{the look and feel}} and increase consistency. A new System Settings module, Desktop Theme Details, gives the user control over each element of various Plasma themes. Wallpapers are now provided plugins, so developers can easily write custom wallpaper systems in KDE 4.2. Available wallpaper plugins in KDE 4.2 will be slideshows, Mandelbrot fractals, and regular static images.|$|E

2500|$|In Windows Vista, the Start menu has {{undergone}} major changes, with the taskbar icon no longer labeled [...] "Start" [...] but instead has the Windows pearl orb. At the top level, the Start menu, as in Windows XP, has two columns of menu choices. Under the default configuration, the [...] "Run," [...] and [...] "Printers" [...] options do not appear. However, those items {{can be added}} to the Start menu. One of the chief additions with Windows Vista is a Search pane or box, where users may begin typing immediately. The contents of the Start menu itself are indexed and searchable, besides the global search index. If indexing is turned on, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. This allows the Start menu to act as a fast and powerful <b>application</b> <b>launcher.</b> The Start menu search also doubles as the Run command from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu.|$|E

The launcher created this way is accessible from the desktop and {{is not limited to}} GNOME Shell. For instance it may be used with Unity, used on Ubuntu. This feature facilitates the integration of the desktop and World Wide Web, which is a goal of Web's developers. Similar features {{can be found in the}} Windows version of Google Chrome. For the same purpose Mozilla Foundation previously developed a standalone application Mozilla Prism, which was superseded by the project Chromeless.|$|R
40|$|Computer users {{constantly}} face {{situations where}} repetitive tasks emerge {{and there is}} no easy way to automate them. Although there are several <b>application</b> <b>launchers</b> currently available, they lack of automating power to face the uniqueness of the repetitive tasks that arise from everyday usage. Many times, users have to resort to scripting languages and macro recorders to perform these tasks. However, these means are too farfetched for a common user. We propose an approach capable of monitoring user activity, learn which tasks are recurrent and suggest an automation capable of completing the repetitive task. All this is done without disturbing the user or requiring his intervention. Preliminary user tests show that our solution can help users perform at least 169 % faster for simple tasks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{classification}} and analysis of failures of ultracapacitors {{to be used in}} rail <b>launchers</b> <b>applications</b> with the aim of investigating the influence of strong impulsive electromagnetic fields on their performance. Considering the very harsh environment present in rail <b>launchers</b> <b>applications,</b> a reliability analysis of components of the launch mass is very important to assess the failure modes and the relevant effects. To this purpose, we introduced a Failure Modes and Effects analysis methodology (FMEA) to ensure an optimal design and material choice as well as to evaluate the impact of all possible failure mechanisms and causes on the ultracapacitors. This approach allows to reduce or possibly eliminate the effects of potential failure modes before the launch mass design completion and before failures occur during the launch...|$|R
