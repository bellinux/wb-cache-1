5|$|The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ordered 14 {{aircraft}} in 2003 {{to use in}} both the airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) and transport roles. The AW101 was modified by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the Japan Defense Agency designated the model MCH-101. Special features include the automated folding of the rotor and tail. For the mine-hunting role, the MCH-101 has been outfitted with Northrop Grumman's AQS-24A airborne mine-hunting system and AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for a complete surface-to-bottom mine detection capability, as well as Mk-104 <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine</b> sweeping gear.|$|E
25|$|He then {{engaged in}} a series of {{recoveries}} between 12 June 1943 and 10 April 1944, during which time he defused four German ground mines, three magnetic mines and one <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine.</b> During the defusal of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine,</b> which had lain in the water off Milford Haven Wales {{for two and a half}} years, Goldsworthy struck his head on the foot of a ladder while underwater and injured his back while trying to get clear. He, nonetheless, had still managed to extract the fuse and primer. He was awarded the George Cross in September 1943 for his work in recovering and defusing mines during this period; he was also promoted to lieutenant commander.|$|E
25|$|HMS Veteran {{served in}} the Norwegian {{campaign}} in 1940. While there, her bridge was adorned with a huge stuffed hippopotamus head, acquired by Broome from Formby Golf Club during a spree ashore. Broome also acquired a German torpedo, which had missed its target and run onto the shore of a fjord. Suitably covered in German graffiti, it was eventually handed to the authorities in Rosyth. After {{the end of the}} Norwegian campaign, Veteran was assigned to counter a threatened German invasion, and was damaged by an <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} for the Admiralty Research Laboratory, from which emerged a group of many notable scientists, {{including}} David Bates, Robert Boyd, George Deacon, John Gunn, Harrie Massey, and Nevill Mott; he worked on the design of magnetic and <b>acoustic</b> <b>mines,</b> and was instrumental in designing a new mine that was effective against German minesweepers.|$|R
50|$|In naval warfare, an <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine</b> {{is defined}} as one being {{equipped}} with a hydrophone that functions as a listening device. This hydrophone listens for particular noises made by any ship or vessel's machinery (propellers). It can also detects structural sounds from the hull of a passing ship. An <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine</b> is mainly operated by a sensitive diaphragm located inside the hydrophone. This diaphragm is actuated when a certain noise reaches a predetermined intensity and duration. This initiates the closing of a switch causing an electrical circuit to flow and the mine to detonate.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>acoustic</b> <b>mines</b> were {{deployed}} by the German navy in the Thames Estuary in October 1940. These mines could {{be set to}} broad spectrum or narrow spectrum sound signature. The broad setting would be triggered {{by the sound of}} any passing ship's propeller; the narrow would be set to only explode when the propellor of a large ship was detected.|$|R
50|$|She then {{embarked}} French troops, {{and escorted}} by the , sailed to Saigon.

50|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine</b> {{is a type}} {{of naval}} mine which {{monitors}} audio activity in its vicinity. Depending on its design, it will either passively listen to its environment, depending only on the noise that is made by passing ships or actively send out audio pulses, not unlike a sonar, listening to the lapse in time in which the echo returns to it.|$|E
50|$|In December 1939, Drax was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief, The Nore serving until 1941. It {{was an important}} post, as {{he was responsible for}} the protection of the east coast convoys from Scotland to London. He faced the multiple threats of <b>acoustic</b> <b>mines</b> and magnetic mines as well as attacks from the air and by surface vessels, especially after the fall of the Netherlands and of Belgium.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{ships were}} obsolete four-stack destroyers built {{during and after}} World War I with usable power plants. The number 4 boiler, fourth stack, and torpedo tubes were removed, depth charge racks repositioned forward from the stern and angled outboard, and the stern modified to support sweep gear: davits, winch, paravanes, and kites. Two 60-kilowatt turbo-generators replaced the three original 25-kilowatt generators to improve capability for sweeping magnetic and <b>acoustic</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although the Motor Minesweepers {{lacked the}} power to tow sweeps for contact mines they were {{suitable}} for handling equipment for combating magnetic mines and some later models were fitted with an acoustic hammer on a retractable [...] "A" [...] frame over the bows for countering <b>acoustic</b> <b>mines.</b> The Motor Minesweepers had limited use post-war so they were quickly disposed of.Three were transferred by Lend-Lease to the Soviet Navy.|$|R
50|$|HMS Elgin {{was built}} by the William Simons & Company at their {{shipyard}} in Renfrew. She was originally to be named Troon, but was renamed before launch to avoid possible misunderstandings of having vessels named after coastal locations.

50|$|As {{a result}} of {{experiences}} during the Korean War, the United States Navy undertook a large scale {{construction of a new}} series of minesweepers. In contrast to the steel-hulled minesweepers built before, the Agile-class minesweepers were built mostly of wood with bronze and stainless steel fittings and engines to minimize their magnetic signature. The ships were equipped with the UQS-1 mine-locating sonar and were capable of sweeping moored, bottom contact, magnetic and <b>acoustic</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In February 1940, the Admiralty {{assigned}} Crosfield to the Mine Design Department HMS Vernon at Portsmouth. The first assignment {{he completed}} was to design equipment for detecting midget submarines at Britain's harbour entrances. He was then charged with designing a magnetometer to measure a ship's magnetic field, but he realised that magnetic mines were useless against German E-Boats (motor torpedo boats) that were built with wooden hulls. So he started {{work on an}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine</b> that worked on the sound emitted by a ship's propeller. He had made a prototype and started testing it when Commander Brown called him in {{and told him to}} get back to the magnetometer. He ignored the order and, [...] "with improved security", continued the development of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>mine.</b> This became an official priority after a British destroyer, which had been 'degaussed' and was therefore impervious to magnetic mines, set off a mine in the Thames Estuary. With the help of a mathematician and much testing he overcame the technical obstacles. In its first use in the Baltic Sea, 200 of the new acoustic mines sank 47 enemy vessels and the Baltic was closed to shipping for two weeks. One of his colleagues at HMS Vernon was his friend and future Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick, who built up a little organization which modified mines to meet new tactical requirements.|$|E
