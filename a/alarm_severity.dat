40|$|In this thesis, an {{automatic}} control performance monitoring tool is analyzed and evaluated. The tool is called Control Loop Asset Monitor (CLAM) {{and is a}} part of the Asset Optimization extension to the ABB platform System 800 xA. CLAM calculates and combines a number of performance indices into diagnoses. The functionality, choice of configuration parameters and the quality of the result from CLAM have been analyzed using data from the pulp mill Södra Cell Mörrum. In order to get reliable diagnoses from CLAM, it is important that it is correctly configured. It was found that some of the default parameters should be modified and the recommendations in the user guidelines should be updated. Using the current default parameters, there are some combinations of indices that never can exceed defined <b>alarm</b> <b>severity</b> thresholds. The conclusions in this thesis have been documented in an online help that also includes simple user instructions for how the results from CLAM should be interpreted. The results have been analyzed together with the staff at Södra Cell Mörrum in order to validate that they are correct and relevant from a user perspective. It was found that the results are correct, but there are some things that can be improved in order to make CLAM more user friendly...|$|E
40|$|Network service {{providers}} {{are struggling to}} reduce cost {{while at the same}} time improving customer satisfaction. This thesis addresses three relevant underlying challenges to achievieng these goals: - managing an overwhelming flow of low-quality alarms - understanding the structure and quality of the delivered services - automation of service configurationAll of the these add to an operator's operational costs since manual work is required in order to understand the alarm and service status as well as for configuring new services. We propose solutions based on domain-specific languages, data-mining and self-learning. We look at how domain-models can be used to capture explicit knowledge for alarms and services. In addition, we apply data-mining and self-learning techniques to understand the alarm semantics. The alarm solution is validated with a quantitative analysis based on real alarm documentation and an alarm database from a large mobile service provider. A qualitative analysis of the service management solutions is given based on prototypes and input from {{service providers}}. We present an approach to alarm interfaces by providing a formal alarm model together with a domain-specic language, BASS. This means that we can verify the consistency of an alarm interface and automatically generate artifacts such as alarm correlation rules or alarm documentation based directly on the model. From a baseline without any correlation, our alarm domain-model based on vendor documentation could automatically find the root-cause alarms in 40 % of the cases. In the process of producing an alarm model from pre-existing alarm documentation for a commercial product, we found over 150 semantic warnings. We also propose a domain specific language called SALmon, which allows for efficient representation of service models, along with a computational engine for calculation of service status. Furthermore, this thesis illustrates how we can achieve automatic service configuration based on YANG, the domain-specific language standardized in the IETF. Prototypes show that the service domain-models can capture the semantics of service models, and automatically render parts of the service management solution. It is not always possible to capture expert knowledge in models. Therefore, we propose a data-mining and self-learning solution that learns alarm priorities from the decisions taken by the network administrators. The solution assigns the same severity as a human expert in 50 % of the cases compared to 17 % for the original <b>alarm</b> <b>severity.</b> Godkänd; 2012; 20120116 (stewal); DISPUTATION Namn: Stefan Wallin Ämnesområde: Mobila system/Mobile Systems Opponent: Professor Rolf Stadler, Skolan för elektro- och systemteknik, KTH, Stockholm, Ordförande: Professor Christer Åhlund, Institutionen för system- och rymdteknik, Luleå tekniska universitet Tid: Torsdag den 23 februari 2012, kl 10. 00 Plats: D 770, Luleå tekniska universite...|$|E
30|$|According to {{the result}} it calculates, our {{algorithm}} colors {{the road map}} for each status changes on GIS projection screens. Once congested level is detected, it produces an <b>alarm</b> with high <b>severity</b> to inform the operators. Nevertheless, dense level also creates <b>alarm</b> with lower <b>severity.</b> After verification of this assessment by operator, VMS can be supplied by messages to inform drivers about the road flow condition.|$|R

50|$|Fault {{management}} systems may use complex filtering systems to assign <b>alarms</b> to <b>severity</b> levels. These can range in severity from debug to emergency, {{as in the}} syslog protocol. Alternatively, they could use the ITU X.733 Alarm Reporting Function's perceived severity field. This takes on values of cleared, indeterminate, critical, major, minor or warning. Note that {{the latest version of}} the syslog protocol draft under development within the IETF includes a mapping between these two different sets of severities. It is considered good practice to send a notification not only when a problem has occurred, but also when it has been resolved. The latter notification would have a severity of clear.|$|R
40|$|The BBL ™ Pneumoslide ™ Test is a serologic latex slide {{agglutination}} {{method for}} the qualitative detection of capsular antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae directly from isolated colonies or pure cultures from liquid nutrient broth. Visible agglutination {{occurs when the}} S. pneumoniae capsular antigen reacts with the antibody-coated latex beads. II. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus), a normal inhabitant of the human upper respiratory tract, {{is one of the}} major causative agents of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia and otitis media in the U. S. 1, 2 Despite the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy, S. pneumoniae has been implicated in infections of debilitated patients with <b>alarming</b> <b>severity</b> and case fatality. Worldwide emergence of penicillin and multiple-drug resistant strains has made accurate and rapid identification of pneumococcal isolates more important. 3 The traditional methods for identification of S. pneumoniae are presumptive procedures based on Gram stain reaction, alpha-hemolysis, optochin susceptibility, and bile solubility. Identification of streptococci directly from blood cultures has been evaluated. 4 Tentatively identified pneumococcal isolates can be confirmed by serological methodology using Neufeld’s quellung reaction with polyvalent antiserum. 5 The latex agglutination procedure permits a simple and more rapid serological identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates for the clinical laboratory. III. PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE The capsular polysaccharide antigen of S. pneumoniae enables the distinction of 83 serotypes. 6, 7 Specific antibodies to the 83 antigens are absorbed onto the surface of latex beads. Latex particle aggregation becomes large enough to allow rapid visualization of positive agglutination in the presence of specific pneumococcal antigens derived from saline suspensions of suspect alpha-hemolytic colonies...|$|R

40|$|Future {{military}} communication networks {{will have}} a mixture of backbone terrestrial, satellite and wireless terrestrial networks. The speeds of these networks vary {{and they are very}} heterogeneous. As networks become faster, it i s n o t enough to do reactive fault manage-ment. Our approach combines proactive and reactive fault management. Proactive fault management is im-plemented by dynamic and adaptive routing. Reactive fault management is implemented by a combination of a neural network and a n expert system. T h e system has been developed f o r the X. 25 protocol. Several fault sce-narios were modeled and included in the study: reduced switch capacity, increased packet generation rate of a certain application, disabled switch in the X. 25 cloud, disabled links. W e also modeled occurrence of <b>alarms</b> in-cluding <b>severity</b> of the problem, location of the event and a threshold. To detect and identify faults we use both numerical data associated with the performance objects (attributes) in the NIB as well as SNMP traps (alarms). Simulation experiments have been performed in order t o understand the convergence of the algorithms, the train-ing of the neural networks involved and the G 2 /NeurOn-Line software environment and MIB design...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND An <b>alarming</b> {{incidence}} and <b>severity</b> of jaundice in Malaria, {{especially in the}} Plasmodium falciparum variety, has been reported from {{various parts of the}} world and at times it causes diagnostic dilemma in both endemic and non-endemic areas, even sometimes affecting the outcome adversely. There are reports depicting association of severe jaundice with falciparum malaria masquerading as fulminant hepatic failure. This study is done to clinically evaluate the cases of malaria with hepatitis in terms of its presentations, extent of hepatic involvement and biochemical parameters. MATERIAL AND METHOD This study was done on 100 confirmed cases of malaria with jaundice, who were admitted in Gauhati Medical College and Hospital during a period of 12 months (1 st July 2012 to 30 th June 2013). Patients were admitted due to complications of malaria like jaundice, nausea and vomiting, pain abdomen, respiratory difficulty, oliguria, altered sensorium, etc. Detailed history, clinical examination, biochemical parameters for liver function test and other blood tests were done in all patients. RESULTS Age of the patients ranged from 13 - 55 years. Among all patients, 96...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{emergence}} of influenza A/H 1 N 1 / 2009 is <b>alarming.</b> The <b>severity</b> of previous epidemics {{suggests that the}} susceptibility of the human population to H 1 N 1 is directly proportional {{to the degree of}} changes in hemagglutinin/HA and neuraminidase/NA; therefore, H 1 N 1 / 2009 and H 1 N 1 / 2008 were analyzed for their sequence as well as structural divergence. METHODOLOGY: The structural and sequence divergence of H 1 N 1 / 2009 and H 1 N 1 / 2008 strains were analyzed by aligning HA and NA amino acid sequences by using ClustalW and ESyPred 3 D software. To determine the variations in sites of viral attachment to host cells, a comparison between amino acid sequences of HA and NA glycosylation sites was performed with NetNGlyc software. The antigenic divergence was executed by CTL epitope prediction method. RESULTS: The amino acid homology levels of H 1 N 1 / 2009 were 20. 32 % and 18. 73 % compared to H 1 N 1 / 2008 for HA and NA genes, respectively. In spite of the high variation in HA and NA amino acid composition, {{there was no significant difference}} in their structures. Antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but no addition of a new site of glycosylation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that the circulating novel influenza virus A/H 1 N 1 / 2009 attaches to the same glycosylation receptor sites as its predecessor influenza A/H 1 N 1 / 2008 virus, but is antigenically different and may have the potential for initiating a significant pandemic. Our study may facilitate the development of better therapeutics and preventive strategies, as well as impart clues for novel H 1 N 1 diagnostic and vaccine development...|$|R
