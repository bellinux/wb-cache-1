5|$|The game {{originated}} from the team's wish {{to develop a}} large-scale role-playing game for the DS. Many of the main staff had worked on previous Megami Tensei titles in some capacity, including producer and designer Kazuma Kaneko, director Eiji Ishida, writer Shogo Isogai, and composer Shoji Meguro. The setting in Antarctica was chosen to appeal to an overseas audience. Alongside the new setting, the game featured multiple science fiction elements new to the series, taking inspiration from films such as Damnation Alley <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing.</b> For the music, Meguro used grander musical styles than his previous works, incorporating choir music using a special synthesizer. Reception of the game was generally positive for its story and gameplay, but many disliked its first-person navigation. An enhanced port for the Nintendo 3DS, Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux, will be released in Japan in 2017, and worldwide in 2018.|$|E

The flying saucer in the film had been created by shining mirrors on to a Spanish Renaissance shield suspended from a fishing line. The film was rediscovered in 2010.|$|E

25|$|Schopenhauer's {{second major}} {{departure}} from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated {{as a response}} to the radical philosophical skepticism of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Thing</b> in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.|$|E

During this alliance Thanos cultivates a plan to reunite with Mistress Death, and secretly siphons off the energies of Warlock's Soul Gem, and combines these with the power of the other Infinity Gems to create a weapon capable of destroying a star. Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Thing.</b> Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone. Thanos's spirit eventually reappears to accompany a dying Captain Marvel's soul into the realm of Death.|$|E

It is also nigh-indestructible, capable of taking hits from most superhuman foes to some cosmic level beings and protecting Doom from matter manipulation, reality warping and psychic assaults. The armor has an arsenal of high tech weaponry and gadgets hidden within it, energy manipulation, absorption and projection, is capable of generating a defensive force field and a lethal electric shock stunning or killing anyone who might come in contact with Doctor Doom. The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and recycling systems for air, food, water, and energy, allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure underwater or in outer space.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

500|$|Alan Jones of Starlog {{magazine}} {{suggests that}} [...] "any similarity between Inseminoid and Alien is totally intentional.

However, he also cites Contamination (1980) and Scared to Death (1981) as less effective imitations of Scott. Besides Alien, Edward Jones of the newspaper The Free Lance–Star discerns elements of the novel Dracula (1897), the TV series The Bionic Woman (1976–78), and the films Night of the Living Dead (1968) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> (1982) in the plot of Inseminoid.|$|E
500|$|Glen Morgan {{began writing}} the episode after he read a Science News article about men in Greenland who found a 250,000-year-old item encased in ice.

Campbell's 1938 novella Who Goes There? and its two feature-film incarnations: The Thing from Another World (1951), directed by Christian Nyby and produced by Howard Hawks, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> (1982), directed by John Carpenter. Chris Carter has cited them as the main inspirations for the episode. As in the novella and films, the characters cannot trust each other because they are uncertain if they are who they seem to be. Carter particularly enjoyed this aspect, because it pitted Mulder and Scully against each other and provided [...] "a new look on their characters early on in the series".|$|E

I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here."

500|$|The soundtrack was Horner's {{first major}} film score, and {{was written in}} {{four and a half}} weeks. The {{resulting}} 72 minutes of music was then performed by a 91-piece orchestra. Recording sessions for the score began on April 12, 1982 at the Warner Bros. lot, The Burbank Studios and continued until April 15. A pickup session was held on April 30 to record music for the Mutara nebula battle, while another session held on May 3 was used to cover the recently changed epilogue. Horner used synthesizers for ancillary effects; at the time, science fiction films such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> were eschewing the synthesizer in favor of more traditional orchestras. [...] Craig Huxley performed his invented instrument—the Blaster Beam—during recording, as well as composing and performing electronic music for the Genesis Project video. While most of the film was [...] "locked in" [...] by the time Horner had begun composing music, he had to change musical cue orchestration after the integration of special effects caused changes in scene durations.|$|E

This scene pokes fun at the DC vs. Marvel rivalry (Batman's Batmobile of DC Comics <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> a property of Marvel Comics). Another scene in the episode references Danish physicist Niels Bohr. In his book What's Science Ever Done For Us: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe, Paul Halpern wrote [...] "In the episode , one of Homer's favorite TV shows is preempted by the program The Boring World of Niels Bohr. Homer is so upset that he clutches an ice-cream sandwich, aims it at the screen like it's a remote control, squeezes out its contents, and splatters Bohr's image. In contrast to Homer's reaction, most physicists heap nothing but accolades upon Bohr, whose revolutionary ideas shaped the modern concept of the atom." ...|$|E

The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning.
