40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of floristic activities and observations is mapped and <b>analysed</b> (<b>Map</b> 1, p. 162). The nature and importance of floristic data gathered by amateurs is {{compared with those of}} professional surveys. The use of the database FLORBASE is illustrated with various examples. Recently, the financial scope of FLORON has widened considerably. Besides, it now cooperates with several other non-governmental organizations of similar nature. Adding to this the enthusiasm of a large number highly motivated florists it may be concluded that floristics in the Netherlands faces a bright future. The Foundation FLORON was established in 1988. It coordinates and stimulates the activities of botanical naturalists observing the flora of The Netherlands (here called ‘florists’), in order to gather data on the distribution of plant species. Up to 1993, florists have accumulated over 1 million records on a scale unit of 1 x 1 km. Findings of rare and endangered species have been recorded on an even more detailed scale. All data will be added to the national database FLORBASE. In addition to the FLORON data, FLORBASE contains data accumulated by professional observers of various nature conservation organizations, provinces, as well as the national government. The last few years have shown a gradual decrease of the professional activities in this field; {{it is clear that the}} florists will play an increasingly important role in the annual additions of new data to FLORBASE. This year, FLORON has taken over the management of FLORBASE. With over 4 million records from 1975 onwards, FLORBASE has a wide range of uses, both in scientific research, and for planning and evaluation of nature and environmental policy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Coronary artery bypass {{grafting}} (CABG) {{is frequently}} associated with impaired renal function, {{which is often}} attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). “Off-pump” CABG surgery may avoid this complication. Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a recently identifiedearly biomarker for acute kidney injury. We determined {{if there is a}} difference in peri-operative haemodynamics, renal tissue oxygenation (SrtO 2) and kidney injury (determined by NGAL) between on-and off-pump CABG surgery. Methods: In this prospective, randomised trial, 60 patients undergoing CABG were included after local IRB approval and written informed consent. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and near-infrared spectroscopy derived peripheral tissue oxygenation (SptO 2, InSpectra, Hutchinson, thenar muscle) and SrtO 2 (above the kidney, INVOS 5100, Covidien) were continuously recorded during surgery. Blood samples were taken during and after surgery for plasma NGAL analysis. Results: Twenty-nine on- and thirty off-pump patients, with no difference in patient characteristics, were <b>analysed.</b> <b>MAP</b> and SptO 2  were similar in both groups during surgery.  However, SrtO 2 was significantly more decreased in the on-pump group, the median (range) area under baseline SrtO 2 was 698  (239 - 1980) % · min– 1 in the on-pump (n = 17)  vs. 233 (0 - 2956) % · min– 1 in the off-pump group (n = 21), respectively. Additionally, onpump CABG resulted in significantly higher median (range) NGAL values than off-pump CABG, with 100 (49 - 212) ng · mL– 1 vs. 71 (29 - 127) ng · mL– 1 at the end of surgery and 121  (52 - 359) ng · mL– 1 vs. 95 (41 - 155) ng · mL– 1 6  hours after surgery. However, there was no change in creatinine levels and none of the patients required renal replacement therapy.   Discussion: While systemic haemodynamics(MAP) and systemic tissue oxygenation (SptO 2) were equal in both groups, SrtO 2 was lower and postoperative NGAL values were higher in the on-pump group compared to the off-pump group. CPB may therefore be associated with an increased risk of postoperative acute kidney injury and this complication may be predicted by...|$|E
40|$|Two {{proteins}} {{were tested}} using biochemical assay techniques {{to determine the}} reasons for their loss of function or loss of primary structure. The first protein that was <b>analysed,</b> <b>MAP</b> kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP 3), dephosphorylates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Dephosphorylation occurs following ERK binding to MKP 3 's N-terminal domain, which activates MKP 3 's allosteric C-terminal phosphatase domain. To determine the mechanism for MKP 3 's loss of function in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, experiments were conducted to test the effect of potential protein-protein interactions on MKP 3 activity. Surface plasmon resonance binding studies using the full-length MKP 3 and N- and C-terminal truncation mutants showed that the N- and C-terminal MKP 3 domains could bind with a dissociation constant (KD) of 1. 43 +/- 0. 41 muM. The low KD value between the two domains is consistent with the presence of an interdomain binding site. A novel MKP 3 activity assay was then developed to test if the binding affected MKP 3 's phosphatase activity. Chemically-activated MKP 3 C-terminal domain was capable of hydrolysing p-nitrophenol phosphate with a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) ∼ 33 % greater than the full-length MKP 3 protein. However, when MKP 3 C-terminal domain activity was tested {{in the presence of the}} N-terminal domain, the addition led to a dose-dependant inhibition with a KI (inhibition constant) of 0. 68 +/- 0. 37 muM. The similarity between the KD and K I constants, for MKP 3 's N- and C-terminal binding and inhibition, implies that MKP 3 interdomain binding results in inhibition of MKP 3 activity. This finding was compared to experiments showing that pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells contain a non-functional, wild-type MKP 3 that forms high molecular weight oligomers. Biochemical analysis and the detection of the oligomers indicates that MKP 3 overexpression in adenocarcinomas may lead to a loss of enzyme function through intercalation of N- and C-terminal domains via a "domain swap" interaction that results in MKP 3 autoinhibition. The second study was performed on the SARS nucleocapsid (N) protein. N protein displayed an unexpected lability and multiple lower molecular weight bands were detected upon N protein purification. Mass spectrometry was used to identify the bands as the N- and C-terminal fragments of SARS N protein, which result from a specific cleavage after each arginine in the N protein's 184 SSRSSSRSRGNSR 196 sequence. Fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) based assays that were developed to test for non-specific protease activity showed negative results. This may indicate that the SARS N protein possesses a specific autocatalytic activity...|$|E
