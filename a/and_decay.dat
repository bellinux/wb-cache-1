5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from stable}} lutetium, its {{radioactive}} isotopes have several specific uses. The suitable half-life <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> mode made lutetium-176 {{used as a}} pure beta emitter, using lutetium which has been exposed to neutron activation, and in lutetium–hafnium dating to date meteorites. The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E

Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.|$|E

5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Elementary fermions {{are grouped}} into three generations, each {{comprising}} two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes {{up and down}} quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, and the third bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong indirect evidence that {{no more than three}} generations exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E
5|$|In many cultures, {{including}} in Europe, bats {{are associated with}} darkness, death, witchcraft, and malevolence. Because bats are mammals, yet can fly, they are liminal beings in many traditions. Among Native Americans such as the Creek, Cherokee and Apache, the bat is a trickster spirit. In Tanzania, a winged bat cryptid known as Popobawa, {{is believed to be}} a shapeshifting evil spirit that assaults and sodomises its victims. In Aztec mythology, bats symbolized the land of the dead, destruction, <b>and</b> <b>decay.</b> An East Nigerian tale tells that the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner, the bush-rat, and now hides by day to avoid arrest.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-149 {{has high}} {{cross-section}} for neutron capture (41,000barns) {{and is therefore}} used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000barns, {{it is on the}} order of hundreds of barns for 150Sm, 152Sm, and 153Sm, and is 6,800barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium. Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon-135.|$|E

5|$|In the USSR Pontecorvo {{was welcomed}} with honours and given a number of {{privileges}} reserved only to the Soviet nomenklatura. He worked {{until his death in}} what is now the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, concentrating entirely on theoretical studies of high energy particles and continuing his research on neutrinos <b>and</b> <b>decay</b> of muons. In recognition of his research he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1953, membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1955 and the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1958, and two Orders of Lenin. He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 for his work on the weak interaction. He began a lifelong affair with Rodam Amiredzhibi, the wife of poet Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov, in 1950. In 1955 he appeared in public at a press conference where he explained to the world the motivations of his choice to leave the West and work in the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Kingdom revoked his British citizenship on 24 May 1955. Pontecorvo was not permitted to leave the Soviet Union for many years; his first trip abroad being in 1978 when he travelled to Italy for celebrations of Amaldi's 70th birthday. Thereafter, he made frequent trips to Italy, and occasional visits to other countries. France refused to allow him to visit in 1982 and 1984, but relented in 1989.|$|E
