50|$|The {{period between}} 1983 and 1994 {{witnessed}} a rapid array of new initiatives {{introduced by the}} Conservative government, including GCSEs, the Baker Contract, AS levels, a national curriculum with key stages and <b>attainment</b> <b>targets,</b> local financial management, grant maintained status, SATs, OFSTED inspections, staff appraisal, and coursework examination, all of which caused {{a great deal of}} disruption to the school and contributed to an increased turnover of new staff in this period, with many new teachers swiftly exiting the profession. Wells suggested that this chaotic educational environment resulted in more difficulties for Chis and Sid than at any point in its history except during World War II. The school also witnessed a small decline in the grades achieved by its pupils, in part due to the increasingly localised and concomitantly decreasingly selective nature of admissions, although this decline was greatly exaggerated by the local press.|$|E

Population pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 13 HIV-infected patients receiving amprenavir and ritonavir in doses of 600 and 100 mg, respectively, every 12 h. A 2, 500 -subject Monte Carlo simulation was performed. <b>Target</b> <b>attainment</b> was also estimated for a target derived from clinical data. Maximal viral suppression (in vitro) was achieved when amprenavir free-drug concentrations remained greater than four times the 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) for 80 % of the dosing interval. At an amprenavir EC 50 of 0. 03 μM, the likelihood of <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> is 97. 4 %.

40|$|<b>Attainment</b> <b>targets</b> and {{national}} assessments in Flanders The Flemish Ministry of Education and Training implemented {{a program of}} national assessments in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) in 2002. These assessments {{are part of a}} system of quality control and investigate whether students at the end of primary (6 to 12 years) and the different stages of secondary education (12 to 18 years) master the <b>attainment</b> <b>targets</b> for different study domains. <b>Attainment</b> <b>targets</b> are minimum educational goals with regard to knowledge, insight, skills, and attitudes which the educational authorities consider necessary and achievable for a certain pupil population. They are formulated for all domains of the curriculum that are compulsory. Yearly, the Flemish Policy Research Centre for Test Development and Assessments organizes two national assessments. These assessments cover traditional topics like mathematics and native and foreign language skills, as well as more “non-traditional” topics, like technology, natural sciences or civic and citizenship education. Assessment of the more traditional subjects is repeated approximately every five years, which allows the government to make inferences about performance trends. In contrast to other countries and regions, Flanders does not organize national examinations. In accordance with the constitutional freedom of education (Belg. Const. art. 24), the educational authorities do not impose any standards to schools with regard to pupil assessment. Teacher assessment is afforded the most authority. The Flemish national assessments do not have the status of national examinations. They are low-stakes assessments, carried out with representative samples of students and schools, optimally constructed to offer reliable information at the system level of Flemish education. They are a diagnostic tool for the commissioning educational authorities, who use the assessment results as a stepping stone for further analyses. Conclusions about the assessment results and <b>attainment</b> <b>targets</b> are discussed with stakeholders from both research and practice. Features of Flemish assessment culture Flanders has built up a strong assessment culture over the past 15 years. Our policy research centre is not only dedicated to continual professionalization but also aware of the continual need for 'adding value' on a scientific and a societal level. In the present symposium, we want to touch upon a number of features concerned with the added value of the Flemish system of national assessments. We selected three topics which we believe to be of special interest for an international audience. In a first paper, we discuss some of the advanced methods we use to analyze large-scale assessment data. Models from item response theory {{play an important role in}} the calibration study, the standard-setting study, the main study, and the trend analyses across time. Multilevel models are used to analyze differences between schools, and to account for these differences by referring to background characteristics of students, teachers, and schools. A second paper zooms in on performance assessment. In order to assess certain competences included in the <b>attainment</b> <b>targets,</b> paper and pencil tests provide insufficient information and an alternative approach is required. Despite the challenges they impose, we propose that performance assessments provide a valuable addition to more traditional forms of assessment. Over the past several years, we have been exploring new practices and techniques to meet these challenges. In a third and last paper, we elaborate on the school feedback reports we produce. Schools from the assessment sample receive feedback about the average performance of their pupils. They can use this information for internal quality monitoring. Since only a limited sample of schools can participate in a national assessment, "parallel test" versions are also constructed to give all schools the opportunity to evaluate the subject domains that were investigated in the national assessment. status: publishe...|$|E

A 5, 000 -subject Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate pharmacodynamic <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standard dosing regimens from North America were used. Pharmacokinetic parameter variability was derived from existing healthy volunteer data, and MIC data came from the 2002 MYSTIC Program. Ciprofloxacin displayed the lowest <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> against all bacterial species (41 to 46 % for A. baumannii, 53 to 59 % for P. aeruginosa, and 80 to 85 % for the Enterobacteriaceae). Increasing the dose to 400 mg every 8 h did not significantly increase <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> against nonfermenters. Piperacillin-tazobactam <b>target</b> <b>attainments</b> were similar to that of ceftazidime against all pathogens. Higher doses of both compounds were needed to achieve better <b>target</b> <b>attainments</b> against P. aeruginosa. Overall, meropenem, imipenem, and cefepime attained the highest probabilities of attainment against the Enterobacteriaceae (99 to 100 %). The carbapenems appear to be the most useful agents against A. baumannii (88 to 92 %), and these agents, along with higher doses of any of the β-lactams, would be the most appropriate choices for empirical therapy for P. aeruginosa infection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{increase}} <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> rates, switching {{the mode}} of administration from intermittent (InI) to continuous infusion (CoI) has been proposed. In this study, <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> rates and interpatient variation in exposure were compared between vancomycin InI- and CoI-treated critically ill patients. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted among critically ill patients admitted to a level- 2 intensive care unit. Adult patients (18 years or older) treated with intravenous vancomycin for various indications, including sepsis, pneumonia, and endocarditis between 2007 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion. In 2010, vancomycin mode of administration switched from intermittent to continuous. Vancomycin was administered through intravenous infusion, and dosing was guided by therapeutic drug monitoring. <b>Target</b> <b>attainment</b> rates and variations in serum concentration and estimated area under the curve (AUC) were compared between groups. RESULTS: The <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> rate for therapeutic vancomycin exposure was higher in the group treated with CoI than in patients treated with InI (48 % versus 19 %, P < 0. 001). Furthermore, between-patient variation in vancomycin serum concentration was nearly twice as high in intermittently infused patients compared with continuously infused patients. Finally, the correlation between serum concentration and AUC was stronger among patients on vancomycin continuous infusion {{than that of the}} intermittently dosed group (r 0. 93 versus 0. 72). CONCLUSIONS: Switching from intermittent to continuous infusion of vancomycin in a critically ill population provided higher <b>target</b> <b>attainment</b> rates and a more robust drug exposure.
