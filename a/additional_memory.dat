5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and MIDI out {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although {{there is no way to}} switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the <b>additional</b> <b>memory,</b> a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E
25|$|Windows 7 allows up {{to eight}} devices for a maximum of 256GB of <b>additional</b> <b>memory,</b> with up to 32GB on a single storage device.|$|E
25|$|The first PC {{operating}} systems to integrate such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988. Since the 80286 version of Windows 2.0 (Windows/286), Windows applications {{did not suffer}} from the 640 KB barrier. Prior to DOS extenders, if a user installed <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> and wished to use it under DOS, they would first have to install and configure drivers to support either expanded memory specification (EMS) or extended memory specification (XMS).|$|E
50|$|The {{calculator}} has 26 numeric <b>memories</b> as standard. <b>Additional</b> <b>memories</b> can {{be created}} by {{reducing the number of}} bytes available for programs. Using this facility allows a total of 78 memories maximum.|$|R
50|$|CAP {{products}} feature embedded SRAM and ROM {{memories and}} an external bus for <b>additional</b> <b>memories</b> including flash memory, {{together with a}} number of peripherals and standard communications and networking interfaces. This qualifies them as system-on-a-chip devices.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore this {{parallelism}} implies low area overhead (as {{only the}} ACS units {{have to be}} duplicated). In particular, no <b>additional</b> <b>memories</b> are required since all parallelized operations are executed on the same trellis section and, in consequence, on the same data.|$|R
25|$|In the Nintendo GameCube version, {{they took}} {{advantage}} of the system's fast CPU to achieve a higher frame rate, and added more polygons to characters, especially Jango, who has roughly twice the polygon count on GameCube. The GameCube's texture compression allowed them to use high-resolution textures. Texture compression also allowed for improved color variance on textures. Mip mapping support across the board on all textures helped provide a rich and consistent environment. They exploited <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> to improve load times. They implemented projected shadows on all the characters and an increased draw distance to allow for vista views.|$|E
25|$|Ibb Høivold, Norcontrol's chief {{executive}} officer (CEO), was appointed {{chairman of the board}} in June 1968. This created some conflict of interest, as Kongsberg CEO Jens Christian Hauge sat on Norcontrol's board. For 1968 Norsk Data had a revenue of NOK730,000, sold four computers plus <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> for SAM 2, had thirteen employees {{at the end of the}} year and had a profit of NOK21,000. That year a cooperation started with NEBB to develop an automatic hydroelectricity reservoir regulation system with a Nord-1 at its heart. The first system was installed in 1970 and remained in use for eighteen years.|$|E
25|$|The BDOS, CCP and {{standard}} transient commands were (ideally) {{the same in}} all installations of a particular revision of CP/M, but the BIOS portion was always adapted to the particular hardware. Adding memory to a computer, for example, meant that the CP/M system had to be reinstalled with an updated BIOS capable of addressing the <b>additional</b> <b>memory.</b> A utility was provided to patch the supplied BIOS, BDOS and CCP {{to allow them to}} be run from higher memory. Once installed, the operating system (BIOS, BDOS and CCP) was stored in reserved areas at the beginning of any disk which would be used to boot the system. On start-up, the bootloader (usually contained in a ROM firmware chip) would load the operating system from the disk in drive A:.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} {{variation is}} to introduce <b>additional</b> <b>memories</b> for each intermediate node in the discrimination network. This increases the overhead of the Rete, but may have advantages {{in situations where}} rules are dynamically added to or removed from the Rete, {{making it easier to}} vary the topology of the discrimination network dynamically.|$|R

50|$|The book {{features}} previously unpublished photographs, and interviews, {{including those}} with Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, Christopher Knight, Geri Reischl ("Fake Jan"), Mike Lookinland, Ann B. Davis, Sherwood Schwartz, Lloyd J. Schwartz, Sid and Marty Krofft, Rip Taylor, Bruce Vilanch and Paul Shaffer. <b>Additional</b> <b>memories</b> by cast members Florence Henderson, Robert Reed, and Eve Plumb are also included.|$|R
25|$|Some aspects {{attributed}} to the first RISC-labeled designs around 1975 include the observations that the memory-restricted compilers of the time were often unable {{to take advantage of}} features intended to facilitate manual assembly coding, and that complex addressing modes take many cycles to perform due to the required <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> accesses. It was argued that such functions would be better performed by sequences of simpler instructions if this could yield implementations small enough to leave room for many registers, reducing the number of slow memory accesses. In these simple designs, most instructions are of uniform length and similar structure, arithmetic operations are restricted to CPU registers and only separate load and store instructions access memory. These properties enable a better balancing of pipeline stages than before, making RISC pipelines significantly more efficient and allowing higher clock frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The AGC {{also had}} a {{sophisticated}} software interpreter, developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, that implemented a virtual machine with more complex and capable pseudo-instructions than the native AGC. These instructions simplified the navigational programs. Interpreted code, which featured double precision trigonometric, scalar and vector arithmetic (16 and 24-bit), even an MXV (matrix × vector) instruction, could be mixed with native AGC code. While the execution time of the pseudo-instructions was increased (due {{to the need to}} interpret these instructions at runtime) the interpreter provided many more instructions than AGC natively supported and the memory requirements were much lower than in the case of adding these instructions to the AGC native language which would require <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> built into the computer (at that time the memory capacity was very expensive). The average pseudo-instruction required about 24 ms to execute. The assembler and version control system, named YUL for an early prototype Christmas Computer, enforced proper transitions between native and interpreted code.|$|E
500|$|The Altair 8800 {{computer}} was a break-even sale for MITS. They needed to sell <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> boards, I/O boards and other options {{to make a}} profit. The April 1975 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, had a page-long price list that offered over 15 optional boards. The delivery time given was 60 or 90 days, but many items were never produced and dropped from future price lists. Initially, Roberts decided to concentrate on production of the computers. Prompt delivery of optional boards did not occur until October 1975.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unit had}} an {{attractive}} look, and was physically smaller than an IBM-PC. The compact case included two 5" [...] half-height disks (two floppies or one floppy and one hard disk), and ample space for standard options (hard disk controller, <b>additional</b> video <b>memory).</b> Special options (including <b>additional</b> system <b>memory)</b> required using expansion slots, of which four were available.|$|R
5000|$|Siegelmann (2008) {{generalized}} the localist attractor {{network model}} {{to include the}} tuning of attractors themselves. This algorithm uses the EM method above, with the following modifications: (1) early termination of the algorithm when the attractor's activity is most distributed, or when high entropy suggests a need for <b>additional</b> <b>memories,</b> and (2) the ability to update the attractors themselves: , where [...] is the step size parameter of the change of [...] This model reflects memory reconsolidation in animals, and shows {{some of the same}} dynamics as those found in memory experiments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{the number}} of metal layers and the {{frequency}} of VLSI continue to increase, the voltage droop on both the package and vias is becoming more pronounced. This paper analyzes the numerical problem encountered in simulation of power/ground networks together with C 4 package and via model. A new preconditioned iterative method and associated acceleration technique are introduced to overcome shortages of previous methods. The new method not only is effective to speedup simulation without loosing any accuracy, but also extends the usage of preconditioned method to general circuit simulation using only a few <b>additional</b> <b>memories</b> due to its MNA formulation. 1...|$|R
500|$|The {{price of}} Altair BASIC to {{customers}} who purchased <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> and I/O boards from MITS was $75. Users {{may have gone}} along with that if the memory board were reliable. Customers bought the computer from MITS, and working memory from companies like Processor Technology. Rather than pay $500 for BASIC, they would acquire bootleg copies of the software. Only about {{ten percent of the}} early customers actually purchased BASIC. With a royalty due of $30 per copy, Gates felt that the computer hobbyist were stealing money from him. In February 1976 Bill Gates, [...] "General Partner, Micro-Soft", wrote an [...] "Open Letter to Hobbyists" [...] that was sent to every computer publication insinuating that the hobbyists were thieves.|$|E
500|$|Owners of {{mainframe}} {{systems and}} minicomputers could purchase <b>additional</b> <b>memory,</b> interface boards and peripherals from third party suppliers; {{so it was}} predictable that owners of the Altair 8800 computer would do the same. MITS's delays in delivery of systems and accessories accelerated the formation of Altair compatible suppliers. The first ones started appearing in mid-1975 and by July 1976 complete computers systems were readily available. The technical manuals for the Altair 8800 provided electrical schematics of the 100 pin computer bus allowing others to design compatible boards. There was not a proper technical standard {{at the time and}} some [...] "compatible" [...] boards did not work with other [...] "compatible" [...] boards. Later, the industry developed the S-100 bus standard.|$|E
500|$|Several {{peripherals}} {{exist for}} the SG-1000 series. [...] Available at ¥13,800 at its time of release, the SK-1100 keyboard connects through the expansion slot and is compatible with all models. [...] Multiple controllers were created, including the SJ-200 joystick attached to the SG-1000, and the SJ-150 joypad, made for use with the SG-1000 II. [...] A racing wheel known as the SH-400 was made for use with games such as Monaco GP. [...] The C-1000 Card Catcher, sold at ¥1,000, allowing players to play Sega Card titles. [...] Additional accessories existed solely for use with the SC-3000, including the SR-1000 cassette deck, the SP-400 4-color plotter printer, and the SF-7000 expansion device which adds a floppy disk drive and <b>additional</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
30|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} {{of the proposed}} parallel structure (given in Section 4) {{is the use of}} <b>additional</b> intermediate <b>memories</b> (unnecessary in the software implementation). Logically, an interblocks memory unit is formed out of two memories working in ping-pong.|$|R
5|$|The low-end {{model was}} sold with 1MB memory, a 1.44 MB floppy drive, no hard disk, and {{included}} a keyboard for $999. The high-end model cost $1,499 but contained an <b>additional</b> 1MB <b>memory</b> expansion card and a 40MB hard disk.|$|R
50|$|Models with ATI X300 have 64MB {{dedicated}} video memory, whereas {{those with}} the ATI X600 have 128MB dedicated video memory. Both graphics cards can also use a portion of system RAM as <b>additional</b> video <b>memory</b> while also using their dedicated memory.|$|R
500|$|In February 2014, {{work began}} on a multi-year upgrade of 62 B-1Bs, {{scheduled}} {{to be completed by}} 2019. The vertical situation display upgrade (VSDU) replaces existing flight instruments with multifunction color displays, a second display aids with threat evasion and targeting, and act as a back-up display. <b>Additional</b> <b>memory</b> capacity is to be installed for the diagnostics database. [...] Procurement and installation of the IBS upgrades is expected to cost $918 million, research and engineering costs are estimated at $391 million. [...] Other additions are to replace the two spinning mass gyroscopic inertial navigation system with ring laser gyroscopic systems and a GPS antenna, replacement of the APQ-164 radar with the Scalable Agile Beam Radar – Global Strike (SABR-GS) active electronically scanned array, and a new attitude indicator.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is centered}} on the perpetually repeating three-day cycle {{and the use of}} various masks, some of which allow Link to transform into different beings. Link learns to play several melodies on his ocarina, which have a variety of effects, like controlling the flow of time or opening passages to four temples, which house challenges Link must overcome. Unlike Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask requires the Expansion Pak, which provides <b>additional</b> <b>memory</b> for enhanced graphics and more on-screen characters. Majora's Mask was acclaimed by critics, who praised the graphics and complex story. It is now considered {{to be one of the}} greatest video games ever made. Approximately 314,000 copies of the game were sold during its first week in Japan, and three million copies were sold worldwide. The game was rereleased for the GameCube as part of [...] in 2003, for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2009, and for the Wii U's Virtual Console service in 2016. An enhanced remake for the Nintendo 3DS, titled , was released in February 2015.|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} Hitman Go, Lutz and {{his team}} considered some specific {{factors such as the}} game's price, gameplay time, the brand, the genre, the audience's expectation, production restraints, and the business model. Speaking about that game's genre, Lutz noted that the team could have developed an endless running game for Hitman. However, they thought that this style of game did not align with the series' values and would not be well received by its audience. Instead, they felt that translating Hitman into a board game was more appropriate as it gave players time to think and plan before executing moves. This fell in line with the idea of Hitman being a [...] "thinking man’s game". Designers tested a feature that would let players lie in wait for targets, similar to the mainline Hitman games. This feature was cut from the final version for gameplay reasons as it allowed players to kill any target on the board and prevented the puzzles from working as intended. The artistic inspiration for the game was drawn from architectural models and dioramas. Characters were created in fixed poses without any limb animations, like chess pieces. Instead of creating detailed textures which requires <b>additional</b> <b>memory,</b> the artists chose to use colour swatches so that most characters shared materials. This method allowed them to use many different colours for characters without incurring lots of draw calls. The team chose not include dialogue, cutscenes, or a heavy narrative structure in the game, citing that people often play video games in short sessions on mobile devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{parity bit}} was {{originally}} stored in <b>additional</b> individual <b>memory</b> chips; {{with the introduction}} of plug-in DIMM, SIMM, etc. modules, they became available in non-parity and parity (with an extra bit per byte, storing 9 bits for every 8 bits of actual data) versions.|$|R
50|$|Each {{node board}} can support {{a maximum of}} 4 GB of memory through 16 DIMM slots by using {{proprietary}} ECC SDRAM DIMMs with capacities of 16, 32, 64 and 256 MB. Because the memory bus is 144 bits wide (128 bits for data and 16 bits for ECC), memory modules are inserted in pairs. To support the Origin 2000 distributed shared memory model, the memory modules are proprietary and include directory memory, which contains information on the contents of remote caches for maintaining cache coherency, supporting up to 32 processors. <b>Additional</b> directory <b>memory</b> is required in configurations with more than 32 processors. The <b>additional</b> directory <b>memory</b> is contained on proprietary DIMMs that are inserted into eight DIMM slots set aside for its use.|$|R
30|$|Recently, the {{construction}} of collision-free hash tables has been discussed in (Li and Chen 2013). The authors proposed the addition of an on-chip summary vector between the Bloom filter summary and the hash table. This summary vector allows deterministic lookup {{at the cost of}} <b>additional</b> on-chip <b>memory.</b>|$|R
