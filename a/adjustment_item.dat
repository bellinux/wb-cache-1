40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop an Adjustment Assessment Instrument for Omani College Students. The adjustment instrument items were constructed and grouped into academic, family, social and personal adjustment areas common to Omani college students. The content validity of the adjustment instrument was determined by utilizing two Delphi panels. The first panel examined the instrument items which represented Omani students' adjustment areas. The second panel determined the instrument items' content domains and the appropriateness of their dimensions. The revised 190 item instrument was administered to 30 Omani Students at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in order to test the wording of the items and determine the actual time for the completion of the instrument. One item was dropped from the instrument leaving 189 items, including 70 positive and 119 negative items. The developed adjustment instrument was administered to 400 Omani students at SQU. Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability for the developed instrument were investigated. The test-retest reliability was determined by administering the instrument to 37 subjects using two week intervals between the two tests. In addition to reliability consideration, construct validity was determined by examining (a) instrument dimensionality, (b) factor analysis, (c) item analysis, and (d) internal consistency. The results revealed that the developed adjustment instrument possessed high reliability estimation which was adequate for individual measurement. In addition, the results supported the construct validity of the instrument as an adjustment measure. The results of the correlation matrix of the developed four dimensions and of the inter-factor correlation of the adjustment questionnaire provided evidence for the multidimensionality of the instrument. Also, factor analysis results confirmed that the developed instrument consisted of four dimensions: academic, family, social and personal adjustment. Moreover, item-total correlation finalized the instrument, which included 58 items, of which 25 were positive and 32 negative. These items were retained as <b>adjustment</b> <b>item</b> statements for the final Adjustment Instrument for College Students. The results of the internal consistency measurements provided additional support for the construct validity of the final adjustment instrument...|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates 2 {{adjustments}} to common scoring approaches for situational judgment tests (SJTs). These adjustments {{can result in}} substantial improvements to item validity, reductions in mean racial differences, and resistance to coaching designed to improve scores. The first adjustment, applicable to SJTs that use Likert scales, controls for elevation and scatter (Cronbach & Gleser, 1953). This <b>adjustment</b> improves <b>item</b> validity. Also, {{because there is a}} White–Black mean difference in the preference for extreme responses on Likert scales (Bachman & O’Malley, 1984), these adjustments substantially reduce White–Black mean score differences. Furthermore, this adjustment often eliminates the score elevation associated with the coaching strategy of avoiding extreme responses (Cullen, Sackett, & Lievens, 2006). Item validity is shown to have a U-shaped relationship with item means. This holds both for SJTs with Likert score response formats and for SJTs where respondents identify the best and worst response option. Given the U-shaped relationship, the second adjustment is to drop items with midrange item means. This permits the SJT to be shortened, sometimes dramatically, without necessarily harming validity...|$|R
40|$|Missing data in survey {{research}} occurs from unit nonresponse or item nonresponse.

We therefore assessed the unidimensionality of the PDQ- 39 SI using Rasch and confirmatory factor analysis. Both analyses showed model misfit. <b>Adjustment</b> for differential <b>item</b> functioning and disordered response category thresholds did not improve model fit, and residual analyses showed deviation from unidimensionality.

40|$|The study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} whether a correlation exists between job and marital adjustment. The primary emphasis is upon coexistence, if any, between adjustment in marriage and in industrial or occupational behavior. Specifically, the study is concerned with an analysis of occupationally adjusted and maladjusted persons in terms of job adjustment and marital <b>adjustment</b> <b>items</b> in order to decide whether the relative degree of occupational adjustment coexists with a similar relative degree of marital adjustment. Another aspect of the problem is to determine what changes occur in the findings due to an increase in sample size of more than one hundred per cent.; The investigators working on this project found no previous studies on the relationship between job and marital adjustment. Studies have been made of job and marital adjustment as more or less distinct areas of human behavior but in no case was an effort made to see whether a correlation exists between them.; As a pilot study this project should provide fruitful hypotheses for further research. It will indicate whether any relationship exists between the marital and occupational areas of human behavior when a relatively large number of persons having the same job classification are studied. It may indicate the feasibility of predicting adjustment in one area of human behavior from a measure of adjustment in another area.; The present study has three distinct advantages over many others which were concerned with occupational behavior: (1) it was not financed by a business organization; (2) the subjects were not aware that they were sought because of their place of employment; and (3) the subjects were not contacted or interviewed during their working hours.; The study includes persons who are married, or have been married, and who have civil service ratings classifying them among the "best" and "least" adjusted attendants at a large public hospital in Southern California. In addition, the study is concerned with the husbands and wives of these attendants for in each interviewing situation both husband and wife were sought as subjects.; The study is limited to the determination of the correlation between the relative degree of the adjustment of persons in their jobs and in their marriages. It is not primarily concerned with the precedence of adjustment in one area of human behavior over adjustment in another area, nor whether one is the cause of the other, or whether both have a common origin...|$|R

The authors used 2000 - 2001 data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study to examine differential item functioning (DIF) in 2 versions of the Experiences of Discrimination (EOD) Index, an index measuring self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic and gender discrimination. DIF may confound interpretation of subgroup differences. Large DIF was observed for 2 of 7 racial/ethnic discrimination items: White participants reported more racial/ethnic discrimination for the 2 ̆ 2 at school 2 ̆ 2 item, and black participants reported more racial/ethnic discrimination for the 2 ̆ 2 getting housing 2 ̆ 2 item.

The process consisted of 3 stages: translation and linguistic validation, field-test, and data analysis. The translation was performed {{in accordance with the}} International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and World Health Organization guidelines, and field-test data were collected in 4 departments in 2 different hospitals. Field-test data were analyzed using Rasch Measurement Theory. Results:. A total of 495 patients completed the Danish BODY-Q field-test 1 – 4 times, leading to a total of 681 assessments with an overall response rate at 76 %.

The case studies are from free-radical, bulk and/or solution polymerizations, covering the range from homo- to hexa-polymerization at both regular and elevated temperature levels, i. e., without and with possible depropagation steps. The model eventually tackles complex polymerization features, ranging from conversion-time histories to more esoteric multi-component composition and/or sequence length profiles. Part 2 of the series will describe more complicated situations with depropagation and composition control policies, all relying solely on a unique monomer/polymer database of physico-chemical properties and other characteristics, with no further parameter <b>adjustment.</b> These database <b>items</b> will be cited in tables in part 2 of the series.
