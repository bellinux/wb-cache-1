25|$|Constantine died not {{too long}} after his excommunication and was succeeded by Comita III. Comita quickly came to terms with William and Ubaldo, {{promising}} to marry his son Marianus II to William's daughter Agnes. Comita was forced by Ubaldo to make an oath recognising him as permanent <b>apostolic</b> <b>legate</b> to the island. It was about this time that Genoese ships landed near Cagliari, William was defeated, and S. Gilla razed. The war {{turned out to be}} a mere raid.|$|E
25|$|In 1098, Roger I of Sicily {{was named}} the {{equivalent}} of an <b>apostolic</b> <b>legate</b> by Pope Urban II and later his son Roger II of Sicily became the first King of Sicily and formed {{what would become the}} Kingdom of Sicily which lasted nearly 700 years. Under the Normans Southern Italy was united as one region and started a feudal system of land ownership in which the Normans were made lords of the land while peasants performed all the work on the land.|$|E
25|$|Gregory’s pontificate {{witnessed}} {{the end of}} the iconoclasm controversy in the Byzantine Empire, while Gregory himself promoted the celebration of the feast of All Saints within the Frankish kingdom {{on both sides of the}} Rhine River. Gregory is also known for his appointment of Ansgar as Archbishop of Hamburg and Bremen in 832, and as the <b>apostolic</b> <b>legate</b> to the northern and eastern parts of Europe. On March 31, 837, Gregory sent the Pallium to the Archbishop of Salzburg; he also sent one to Venerius, the Patriarch of Grado, in 828, in support of his claims to have jurisdiction over the bishops of Istria. When a synod awarded jurisdiction to Maxentius, the Patriarch of Aquileia, Venerius appealed to Gregory, who supported him. Meanwhile, the Lombard King Lothair backed Maxentius, who forced the bishops of Istria to obey him, while at the same time ignoring Gregory’s orders to cease. Gregory also supported the candidacy of John IV (Bishop of Naples).|$|E
5000|$|On October 15, Pope John XXI {{appointed}} John of Vercellae, OP, {{as well as}} Hieronymus, the Minister General of the Franciscans, as <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Legates</b> to go to France {{to arrange}} a peace between King Philip and King Alfonso X of Castile. [...] The urgency of their mission was repeated in {{a letter from the}} College of Cardinals, written during the Sede Vacante following the death of Pope John XXI on May 16, 1277. [...] Pope Nicholas III repeated the same urgent wish for peace directly to King Philip III of France and King Alfonso X of Castile, with a recommendation for John of Vercellae and Hieronymus Masci. [...] On March 12, 1278, Fr. Hieronymus Masci was named a cardinal, but the legates had their orders reinforced by a letter from Nicholas III dated April 4, 1278. [...] Another letter was sent to Cardinal Masci on April 23, urging him to conclude the embassy as soon as possible, since his services were urgently needed in the Roman Curia.|$|R

5000|$|In 857, the Annales Bertiniani {{reported}} that a dog sat on the archiepiscopal throne of Trier, which was interpreted as an omen portending the fall of Theotgaud. In the middle of June 863, Theotgaud and Gunther, Archbishop of Cologne, the two archbishops of Gallia Belgica, presided over a church synod of all the bishops of Lotharingia held at the bequest of Lothair II concerning his abandonment of his first wife Teutberga and his union with a woman named Waldrada. Pope Nicholas I sent <b>apostolic</b> <b>legates</b> to investigate the matter, but Lothair's bishops affirmed that they had advised him to spurn his lawful wife and take another. Theotgaud and Gunther gave grounds for their actions in a letter which they personally brought to Nicholas. He anathematised the council anyway and excommunicated all the bishops. Theotgaud and Gunther continued to defend their actions in a seven-page tome accusing the pope of unjustly banning them. The tome {{was sent to the}} rebellious Photius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and to the bishops of Lotharingia. Even the Emperor Louis II, who had secured the pope's election in 858, supported the archbishops. Theotgaud, who is sometimes regarded as a mere tool of Gunther, returned to his diocese to perform his episcopal and pastoral functions for Easter despite the ban.|$|R
500|$|Reluctant to {{face the}} Patriarch's wrath, Paul once more decided to flee, and try his luck in Rome. As Nicol points out, {{such a move would}} be highly unusual for an Orthodox priest, but may be {{explained}} by his family's links with pro-Catholic circles in the Byzantine capital: George Tagaris, his putative brother or father, was among those who supported the Union of the Churches and had received letters of encouragement from Pope Innocent VI. To avoid passing near Constantinople, Paul was forced to make a broad detour. He took a ship, probably from Trebizond, to the Crimea, where he presented the local governor of the Golden Horde with jewels from the treasure he had amassed. In exchange, he received an escort through the Horde lands (modern Ukraine) to the Kingdom of Hungary, and thence to Rome. There he secured an audience with Pope Urban VI, claiming to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. Paul presented himself to the Pope as a penitent, offered a confession, and embraced the Catholic faith. Impressed by Paul's humble demeanour, the Pope named him (in late 1379 or early 1380) to the titular post of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, which had been vacant since September 1378, when its incumbent, Giacomo da Itri, had declared his allegiance to the Avignon anti-pope Clement VII. Urban also named Paul <b>apostolic</b> <b>legate</b> for all countries [...] "east of Durazzo".|$|E
2500|$|In 1532, Jean de Lorraine {{was named}} Abbot Commendatory {{of the royal}} abbey of Fécamp by the {{patronage}} of King Francis I. [...] He held the Abbey during his lifetime.

2500|$|Bishop José Alves Correia da Silva {{declared}} the miracle worthy of belief on 13 October 1930, officially permitting devotion within the Catholic Church. [...] The event is commemorated {{each year on}} that same date. On 13 May 1946, Pope Pius XII granted a canonical coronation to the venerated image enshrined at the Chapel of the Apparitions of Fátima via his <b>apostolic</b> <b>legate,</b> Cardinal Benedetto Aloisi Masella. On 11 November 1954, the same Pontiff later raised the Sanctuary of Fátima {{to the status of}} Minor Basilica by his Papal brief Lucer Superna.|$|E
5000|$|Prior Diego saw {{immediately}} one of {{the paramount}} reasons for {{the spread of the}} unorthodox movement: the representatives of the Holy Church acted and moved with an offensive amount of pomp and ceremony. On the other hand, the Cathars lived in a state of self-sacrifice that was widely appealing. For these reasons, Prior Diego suggested that the papal legates begin to live a reformed <b>apostolic</b> life. The <b>legates</b> agreed to change if they could find a strong leader. The prior took up the challenge, and he and Dominic dedicated themselves to the conversion of the Albigensians. Despite this particular mission, in winning the Albigensians over by persuasion Dominic met limited success, [...] "for though in his ten years of preaching a large number of converts were made, it has to be said that the results were not such as had been hoped for." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1363, King John II of France and Peter I, the King of Cyprus, came to Avignon, and it {{was decided}} {{that there should be a}} war against the Turks. [...] The Pope, Urban V held a special {{ceremony}} on Holy Saturday, 1363, and bestowed the crusader's cross on the two kings, and on Cardinal Talleyrand as well. [...] John II was appointed Rector and Captain General of the expedition. [...] Cardinal de Talleyrand was appointed <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Legate</b> for the expedition, but he died on 17 January 1364, [...] before the expedition could set out. [...] King John returned to prison in England and died in London on April 8, 1364.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year Constance had the three-year-old Frederick crowned King of Sicily with herself as regent, {{and in his}} name dissolved the ties her late husband had created between the government of Sicily and the Empire. She adopted very different policies from those of her late consort. She surrounded herself with local advisors and excluded the ambitious Markward von Anweiler {{from a position of}} power, attempting to restrict him to his fief in Molise, as well as Walter of Palearia and Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto. She made no mention of any claims to the German kingship and empire when her son was anointed and crowned at Palermo, May 1198. While her own health becoming poor, Constance made warm overtures to the new pope Innocent III, abandoning the long-contended principle that the king was the <b>apostolic</b> <b>legate,</b> a central principle of Norman autonomy in the regno. [...] Faced with the dangers that surrounded any child-king, Constance placed Frederick under the protection of Pope Innocent III. While always maintaining her title of Holy Roman Empress Dowager, she expected her son to be raised as a Sicilian, and to be nothing more than King of Sicily, without distracting claims to Germany or even to the title [...] "King of the Romans" [...] to which her brother-in-law Philip of Swabia was acclaimed by the Roman nobles. That he became much more than that could not be predicted when she unexpectedly died in late November 1198. In her will she set up a Council of Regency for Sicily and made Innocent, who was the child's feudal suzerain, his guardian, a reminder to all of the inviolability of his inheritance.|$|E

50|$|Dagobert's status {{when he went}} east is unclear.

5000|$|Due to {{the crisis}} {{produced}} in southern Italy by the murder, on 19 September 1345, of Andreas of Hungary, the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Cardinal Bertrand was appointed <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Legate</b> by Pope Clement VI on 4 March 1346; on 30 March he was named Vicar General of temporalities in the States of the Church. [...] Naples was a papal fief, and the Pope had a major interest in who the next ruler might be. There were several bad possibilities. Cardinal Bertrand set out for Naples as <b>Apostolic</b> <b>Legate</b> on 26 August 1346 and arrived on 20 November. [...] Andrew had produced a posthumous son on 25 December.
