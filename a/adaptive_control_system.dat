50|$|Adams {{held the}} X-15's {{controls}} against the spin, using both the flight controls {{and the reaction}} control jets in the nose and wings. He managed {{to recover from the}} spin at 118,000 feet and went into an inverted Mach 4.7 dive at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees. In theory, Adams was in a good position to roll upright, pull out of the dive and set up a landing. However, due to high gain in the <b>adaptive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> the X-15 went into a limit-cycle with rapid pitching motion of increasing severity, still in a dive at 160,000 feet per minute. As the X-15 neared 65,000 ft, it was diving at Mach 3.93 and experiencing more than 15 g vertically, and 8g laterally.|$|E
50|$|Ground parties {{scoured the}} {{countryside}} looking for wreckage; {{critical to the}} investigation was the film from the cockpit camera. The weekend after the accident, an unofficial FRC search party found the camera; disappointingly, the film cartridge was nowhere in sight. Engineers theorized that the film cassette, being lighter than the camera, might be further away, blown north by winds at altitude. FRC engineer Victor Horton organized a search and on 29 November, during the first pass over the area, Willard E. Dives found the cassette. Most puzzling was Adams' complete lack of awareness of major heading deviations in spite of accurately functioning cockpit instrumentation. The accident board concluded that he had allowed the aircraft to deviate {{as the result of}} a combination of distraction, misinterpretation of his instrumentation display, and possible vertigo. The electrical disturbance early in the flight degraded the overall effectiveness of the aircraft's control system and further added to pilot workload. The MH-96 <b>adaptive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> then caused the airplane to break up during reentry.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} complexity, the behavior of large-scale distributed systems becomes difficult to predict. The ability of on-line identification and autotuning of <b>adaptive</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> has made the <b>adaptive</b> <b>control</b> theoretical design an attractive approach for quality of service (QoS) guarantee. However, there is an inherent constraint in <b>adaptive</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> i. e. a conflict between asymptotically good control and asymptotically good parameter estimates. This paper addresses these limitations via sensitivity analysis. The simulation study demonstrates that the <b>adaptive</b> <b>control</b> theoretical design depends on the excitation signal, environment uncertainty, and a priori knowledge on the system. In addition, this paper proposes an <b>adaptive</b> dual <b>control</b> framework for mitigating these constraints in QoS design. By incorporating the existing uncertainty of the on-line prediction into the control strategy, the dual <b>adaptive</b> <b>control</b> framework optimizes the tradeoff between the control goal and the uncertainty. 1...|$|R
