25|$|Peter Temin <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{explains}} a tariff is an expansionary policy, like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP {{in the next}} two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff. He concludes that contrary the popular argument, contractionary effect of the tariff was small.|$|E

M. A. Bernal, a professor at the University of Panama, argues that confidence in the ACP's budget is undermined because of the involvement of engineering and consultancy firm Parsons Brinckerhoff.|$|E

Lee Badgett, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Massachusetts Amherst, {{presented}} in March 2014 {{in a meeting}} of the World Bank the results of a study about the economical impact of homophobia in India. Only in health expenses, caused by depression, suicide, and HIV treatment, India would have spent additional 23,100 million dollars due to homophobia. On top, there would be costs caused by violence, workplace loss, rejection of the family, and bullying at school, that would result in a lower education level, lower productivity, lower wages, worse health, and a lower life expectancy among the LGBT population.

2500|$|Hydro-Québec {{would pay}} C$750 million from its cash flow and issue C$4 billion in bonds. CEO Thierry Vandal stated {{the deal would}} allow Hydro-Québec to double its sales to the United States by 2011, but some, like New England Power Generators Association president, Angela O'Connor, worried {{that it could be}} {{standing}} in the way of Canadian competitors from exporting energy to New England. However, these worries were unfounded, responded Jean-Thomas Bernard, chair of Electricity economics at Université Laval, in Quebec City, since non-discrimatory policies set by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [...] guaranteed open access to the North American power grid. [...] "Since Hydro-Québec is already a major exporter to the United States, they would do nothing to jeopardize the agreements". Pierre-Marcel Desjardins, <b>an</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Université de Moncton, stated that right now the grid is full so Hydro-Québec could slow the development of new transmission lines but it could be more difficult to develop additional transmission for new energy projects. Hydro-Québec's Vandal responds to this criticism by stating his company's intention to invest in extra transmission capacity to New England.|$|E
