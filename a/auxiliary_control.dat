500|$|In February 1913, the Admiralty bought five sets of fire-control {{equipment}} from Arthur Pollen for comparative trials {{with the equipment}} designed by Commander Frederic Dreyer. One set was mounted in Queen Mary and consisted of a [...] Argo rangefinder located {{on top of the}} conning tower that fed range data into an Argo Clock Mk IV (a mechanical fire-control computer) located in the transmitting station below the conning tower. The clock converted the information into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The aft torpedo director tower was the backup gunnery control position. All four turrets were provided with 9-foot rangefinders and 'B' and 'X' turrets were further outfitted to serve as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> positions.|$|E

500|$|During the Battle of Tsushima, Knyaz Suvorov was {{the lead}} ship in the Russian battle line and she opened fire at the , {{flagship}} of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō at 14:05. Mikasa began to return fire about five minutes later, joined by the battleship [...] and the armored cruiser [...] The battleship [...] joined the others firing at Knyaz Suvorov around 14:20, which had been set on fire by hits from the other ships. At 14:35, Rozhestvensky and the ship's captain were wounded by splinters that entered the conning tower. Shortly afterwards, Rozhestvensky was knocked unconscious by a splinter in the skull and flames made the conning tower untenable so that the ship had to be steered from her <b>auxiliary</b> <b>control</b> position.

40|$|Abstract—The most {{critical}} component of a protection, con-trol, and monitoring system is the <b>auxiliary</b> dc <b>control</b> power system. Failure of the dc control power can render fault detection devices unable to detect faults, breakers unable to trip for faults, local and remote indication to become inoperable, etc. The auxil-iary dc control power system consists of the battery, battery charger, distribution system, switching and protective devices, and any monitoring equipment. Proper sizing, design, and main-tenance of the components {{that make up the}} <b>auxiliary</b> dc <b>control</b> system are required. Many references for stationary battery sys-tem design address only a specific battery technology, making it difficult to compare different types of batteries for their overall suitability to substation application. Also, most references do not address the particular requirements of the electrical substation environment and duty cycle. This paper provides an overall re-view of things to consider in designing the <b>auxiliary</b> dc <b>control</b> power system for an electrical substation. I...|$|R
