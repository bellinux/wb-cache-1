25|$|Two {{types of}} <b>A-scan</b> {{ultrasound}} biometry {{are currently in}} use. The first is contact applanation biometry. This technique requires placing an ultrasound probe on the central cornea. While this is a convenient way to determine the axial length for most normal eyes, errors in measurement almost invariably result from the probe indenting the cornea and shallowing the anterior chamber. Since the compression error is variable, it cannot be compensated for by a constant. IOL power calculations using these measurements will lead to an overestimation of the IOL power. In shorter eyes, this effect is amplified. The second type is immersion <b>A-scan</b> biometry, which requires placing a saline filled scleral shell between the probe and the eye. Since the probe does not exert direct pressure on the cornea, compression of the anterior chamber is avoided. A mean shortening of 0.25–0.33mm has been reported between applanation and immersion axial length measurements, which can translate into an error of IOL power by approximately 1 D. In general, immersion biometry {{has been shown to}} be more accurate than contact applanation biometry in several studies. The main limitation with the <b>A-scan</b> ultrasound is the poor image resolution due to the use of a relatively long, low-resolution wavelength (10MHz) to measure a relatively short distance. In addition, variations in retinal thickness surrounding the fovea contribute to inconsistency in the final measurement.|$|E

The velocity of sound in these compartments are 1620, 1532, 1641, 1532m/s respectively. Through normal eyes an average velocity of 1555m/s is accepted for calculation.

The next step of this technology is to be able to determine the quality while the weld is being made, this advance can have a great impact on the quality assurance of joints in materials like aluminum, where the spot welding process is a difficult task. In our approach, a state-of-the-art ultrasound transducer assembly is installed in one of the welding electrodes. Working in pulse-echo mode, the system collects <b>A-scans</b> of the waves passing through the welded plates in the direction perpendicular to the plate’s surface. <b>A-scans</b> are gated to allow stack-up front and back wall reflections to be recorded. Such setup has allowed the acquisition of real-time ultrasonic signatures composed of multiple <b>A-scans</b> for each spot weld. Eventually the signature should be processed to extract information about the weld quality. During the welding process temperature gradually increases within the aluminum plates; as sound speed in metals is inversely proportional to the temperature, the time of flight will increase during welding. The change in time of flight of the ultrasonic wave during the whole welding process is a good indicator of the heating rate in the weld and can be a good judge of weld quality.

50|$|<b>A-scan</b> {{ultrasound}} biometry, {{commonly referred}} to as an <b>A-scan</b> (short for Amplitude scan), is routine type of diagnostic test used in optometry or ophthalmology. The <b>A-scan</b> provides data on the length of the eye, which is a major determinant in common sight disorders. The most common use of the <b>A-scan</b> is to determine eye length for calculation of intraocular lens power. Briefly, the total refractive power of the emmetropic eye is approximately 60. Of this power, the cornea provides roughly 40 diopters, and the crystalline lens 20 diopters. When a cataract is removed, the lens is replaced by an artificial lens implant. By measuring both the length of the eye (<b>A-scan)</b> {{and the power of the}} cornea (keratometry), a simple formula can be used to calculate the power of the intraocular lens needed. There are several different formulas that can be used depending on the actual characteristics of the eye. All the information here is not valid for medical purposes.|$|E

40|$|The {{scattering}} of ultrasonic waves {{depends on the}} relation scatterer diameter to wavelength. Coarse grained materials and high frequency ultrasonic waves therefore ere exciting high scattering amplitudes.

Rectifying, digitizing and adding up several <b>A-scans</b> from several different probe positions, angles of incidence or frequencies equalizes interference maxima and minima. The resulting backscattering curve can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for the materials structure characterization. Additionally, an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved for a defect surrounded by a coarse grained structure. The application in practice depends among other things on the time in which a sufficient number of digitized <b>A-scans</b> is averaged and on the dimensions and operating conditions of the equipment.

The elastodynamic finite integration technique (EFIT) is a powerful simulation tool applicable for efficient modelling of the ultrasonic NDT of complex geometries of real-life situations. Computer simulations are performed in pulse-echo mode for various angle shear wave probes of GE Inspection Technologies, such as the WB 45 - 2, WB 70 - 2, WB 45 - 4, and WB 70 - 4 probe, with their respective characteristics. Excited creeping waves are visualized when a shear wave impinges a curved surface of a wheel shaft.

Implementation of our complex conjugate artifact removal (CCR) method required constant phase shifts between consecutive axial scans (<b>A-scans),</b> generated by continuous beam path-length changes from offsetting the pivot point of the scanning mirror placed in the reference arm.
