40|$|We {{tested the}} {{prediction}} that at coarse spatial scales, variables associated with climate, energy, and productivity hypotheses {{should be better}} predictor(s) of bat species richness than those associated with environmental heterogeneity. Distribution ranges of 64 bat species were estimated with niche-based models informed by 3629 verified museum specimens. The influence of environmental correlates on bat richness was assessed using ordinary least squares regression (OLS), simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR), conditional autoregressive models (CAR), spatial eigenvector-based filtering models (SEVM), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). To test the assumption of stationarity, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was used. Bat species richness was highest in the eastern parts of southern Africa, particularly in central Zimbabwe and along the western border of Mozambique. We found support for the predictions of both the habitat heterogeneity and climate/productivity/ energy hypotheses, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected,</b> support varied among bat families and model selection. Richness patterns and predictors of Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae clearly differed from those of other bat families.

Standard coefficients of SAR and CAR models were similar to those of OLS models, while those of SEVM models differed.

40|$|Abstract. Endodontic {{treatments}} consist {{to eliminate}} the vascular nervous system of the tooth. The objectives of this treatment are adequate cleaning and shaping the root canals of the tooth. The endodontic treatment {{is essential to the}} success of prosthetics therapy and the lifetime of the tooth. The difficulties of endodontic treatments lie in the abruptness of canal curvature. Ni-Ti endodontic instruments were introduced to facilitate instrumentation of curved canals. They are superelastic and flex far more than stainless-steel instruments. Despite the increased flexibility we can observe unexpected fractures of these Ni-Ti files. The purpose of this work is to understand the process history on fracture life. Our results are based on microstructural and mechanical investigations of Ni-Ti engine-driven rotary files: X-ray diffraction, SEM, DSC, microhardness and bending tests. Thus, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected,</b> endodontic files are very work-hardened: there is a high density of defects in the alloy, which will impede the phase transformation. DSC: the phase transformation A/R-Phase is predominant, the martensitic transformation is difficult to observe. The microvickers hardness confirms these observations (dislocations and precipitates). The X-rays show that the experimental peaks are broad, which is typical of a distorted lattice. Morover, machining resulted in the work hardening of files. Some thermal treatments are involved in promoting some changes in the mechanical properties and transformation characteristics. Annealing around 400 °C shows good results: the recovery allows a compromise between an adequate density of defects to see the R-Phase germination and a low density to limit the brittleness of these instruments. The surface state of the endodontic files is an important factor for failures and fractures initiation...|$|E
