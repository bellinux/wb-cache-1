40|$|Security {{concerns}} {{in a context}} of increasingly segmented supply chains have led to stricter border control measures, which may potentially negatively affect international trade. Customs around the world have therefore implemented security-motivated certification programs to facilitate licit trade. These programs offer trustworthy trading firms, i. e., <b>Authorized</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operators</b> (AEOs), several advantages in the administrative processing of their shipments including less frequent physical inspections and expedited customs clearance. In this study we focus on Mexico's AEO Program NEEC. In particular, we evaluate the impact of this program by primarily carrying out differences-in-differences estimations on highly disaggregated firm-level data that cover the entire universe of export and import transactions of the country over the period 2009 - 2014. Estimation results suggest that NEEC has been associated with less physical inspections and shorter clearance times and has thereby favored increased firms' exports. Effects seem to be stronger on the frequency of shipments and on consumer goods, industrial inputs, and capital goods...|$|R

40|$|The EU is {{currently}} reshaping its customs legislation and practices. Main pillars {{in the new}} vision are an intensive use of IT (Customs becomes e-Customs), partnerships between Customs administrations and businesses, and collaboration between national Customs administrations. These concepts should support coping with the dilemma of {{on the one hand}} increasing security, safety, financial and health requirements, {{and on the other hand}} the need to reduce administrative burden, to keep the EU a competitive economic zone. Two main concepts in coping with this challenge are Single Window and <b>Authorized</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operators.</b> The EU is investigating how to transform these abstract concepts into a tangible reality. The Beer Living Lab is an EU-funded pilot research project that implements this EU vision in the beer industry.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an ongoing study of an {{initiative}} to build e-Customs capabilities in eastern Africa. The EU’s customs capability building unit is trying to “export ” e-Customs solutions to developing countries in order to strengthen the competiveness of companies based in these countries. Following the international development, e-Customs (with the improved control and traceability possibilities from producer to end consumer) will soon be a prerequisite for participation in international trade. The study {{is based on a}} semiotic framework for e-Customs implementations. Previous research has shown how interdependencies between the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels cause problems already within the EU. This research we are now expanding to the introduction of so called <b>Authorized</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operators</b> (AEOs) in the East African Community. Since this project has just recently started we have only limited empirical material to load our framework, but initial data shows that the African initiative is trying to implement only parts of the e-Customs solutions that are developed to fit into a different semiotic structure. We can conclude that significant challenges lay ahead in adjusting also the rest of the structure if the initiative is to be successful...|$|R

50|$|In March 2015, Israel joined China’s newly {{constituted}} Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), {{becoming a}} founding member of the institution postulating that Israel may become a major economic ally of China. In 2013, China and Israel began to boost the economic relations with respect to agriculture. The two countries decided to set up an agriculture technology incubator in Anhui Province, China enabling joint development of agriculture technologies and solutions in keeping with requirements on the ground. Israeli agriculture trade fairs such as Agrivest and AgriTech have witnessed large Chinese delegations and greater participation from Chinese state-owned and private companies as Chinese's growing middle class and increasing consumer demand as well as increased pressure on agricultural land has prompted the East Asian giant to increasingly look at Israeli agriculture technology to boost crop yields and dairy production. Horizons Ventures, a venture capital fund founded by Hong Kong business mogul Li Ka-shing, said on April 28, 2015, it is leading a US$10.8 million strategic investment in Windward, an Israeli maritime data and analytics company. MarInt, Windward’s satellite maritime analytics system, is widely used by many security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies across the world. With his investments in Israeli high-tech, Li has set the stage for Hong Kong's business elite that it was financially sound and even necessary for the future of the Chinese economy's prosperity to invest in emerging Israeli technologies. In the first half of 2015, China invested more than $2 billion compared to just $300 million for all of 2014. Economists are forecasting China to surpass the US as Israel’s largest trading partner in the near future. On May 25, 2015, the Israeli Trade Authority signed an <b>Authorized</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Operator</b> (AEO) agreement that simplifies customs and approval procedures for Chinese exporters to Israel. On June 22, 2015, The Delek Group agreed to sell a 52% controlling stake of its company to the Chinese civilian-run conglomerate Fosun International. On September 2 2015, Fosun International made another investment in Israel where it agreed to purchase the Ahava cosmetics firm for NIS 300 million ($77 million USD).|$|E
