25|$|Two years later, on a {{scorching}} {{hot summer}} night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags {{and he tells}} an <b>amazing</b> <b>story.</b> Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: traversing treacherous mountains, finding the Kafirs, mustering an army, taking over villages, and dreaming of building a unified nation and even an empire. The Kafirs (pagans, not Muslims) were impressed by the rifles and Dravot's lack of fear of their idols, and acclaimed him as a god, the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great. They show a whiter complexion than others of the area ("so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends") implying their ancient lineage to Alexander himself. The Kafirs practised a form of Masonic ritual, and Dravot's reputation was further cemented when he showed knowledge of Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.|$|E

2500|$|On September 19, 2012, NPRs Drew Toal {{reviewed}} the book, reiterating Simon's astonishment {{at the impact}} that Dumas made in life and literature, and calling the book and life of Dumas [...] "fascinating". He compared the historical influence of Dumas with his offspring, stating he was [...] "larger-than-life" [...] and that [...] "the sword was mightier than the pen" [...] for this father of a famous novelist. While acknowledging the military impact that Dumas made in France, along with the inspiration his life provided as a backdrop in literature throughout history, Toal {{was surprised at the}} level of enthusiasm the author expressed about his subject. [...] "I like to think of him as history's ultimate underdog," [...] Reiss had explained in his earlier NPR interview. [...] "He's a black man, born into slavery, and then he rises higher than any black man rose in a white society before our own time. He became a four-star general and challenges Napoleon, and he did it all 200 years ago, at the height of slavery." [...] In the end, Toal summed up his review, stating, [...] "Despite Reiss' sometimes overblown regard, it's difficult to argue with him. That a former slave could rise on his merits so far, so fast some seven decades before Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation is a truly <b>amazing</b> <b>story,</b> one that needs no literary embellishment." ...|$|E
