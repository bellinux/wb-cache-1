Operating in Beverly Hills (and claiming {{representation in}} Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand), it used similar roadshow techniques to market television {{programs such as}} The Ern Westmore Show. Babb also acted as a showman for hire, promoting others' films when not working on his own. Among them was a nudie-cutie picture titled Kipling's Women, <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> show, and Five Minutes to Love, a reworking of a Rue McClanahan film.|$|E

Impressed by the image, she insisted on her husband building the temple for the deity and starting the Ratha Yatra. Another variant suggests that Jagannath was pleased with her temple and promised to visit her house, now the Gundicha Temple.|$|E
25|$|Duchamp's final major {{art work}} {{surprised}} {{the art world}} that believed {{he had given up}} art for chess 25 years earlier. Entitled Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage ("Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas"), it is a tableau, visible only through <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> hole in a wooden door. A nude woman can be seen lying on her back with her face hidden, legs spread, and one hand holding a gas lamp in the air against a landscape backdrop. Duchamp had worked secretly on the piece from 1946 to 1966 in his Greenwich Village studio while even his closest friends thought he had abandoned art. The torso of the nude figure is based on Duchamp's lover, the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, with whom he had an affair from 1946 to 1951.|$|E

25|$|My idea {{suggested}} to that gentleman {{was to write}} a story in which the principal character should be a miser, who had a daughter, and that the struggles of feeling between the love for his child and his love of money, should produce certain effects and results; and as all my ancestors were mixed up in the Rebellion of '45, I suggested that the story should be of that date, in order that I might introduce some scenes and circumstances connected with that great party struggle, and also wishing to let the public of the present day have <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> at the places of public amusement of the period, I took considerable pains to give correct views and descriptions of those places which are now copied and produced upon the stage; and I take this opportunity of complimenting my friend Halliday for the very excellent and effective manner in which he has dramatised the story.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 and 1997, BAYSWAN {{provided}} {{support to}} the workers at the Lusty Lady Theatre, <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> show in San Francisco, {{in their effort to}} persuade club management to remove the one-way mirrors in customer booths that allowed customers to clandestinely photograph and videotape dancers, the product of which they feared would begin appearing on the Internet or on bootleg videos without dancer permission or compensation. BAYSWAN provided website support for the efforts of the Exotic Dancers Alliance, which took part in the Lusty Lady unionization effort; the website in turn helped to garner public support for the workers as well as inquiries from other exotic dancers and sex workers throughout the country. The group ultimately approached Service Employees International Union Local 790, and in April 1997 Lusty Lady employees voted to unionize, forming the Exotic Dancers Union (EDU), the first sex workers organization of its kind. The union was still active at the venue, which became a worker-owned cooperative in 2003, until its closing on September 2, 2013.|$|E

[...] This angered Brooklyn's management, and they expected Carey to make a full-throated response. When he remained silent, he was fired. One sportswriter regarded the hiring of Stengel as too logical a thing to happen in Brooklyn, but on February 24, 1934, Stengel faced the press {{for the first time as}} the manager of a major league team. McGraw, Stengel's mentor, was too ill to issue a statement on seeing him become a major league manager; he died the following day.|$|E

The later stages of the story introduce Larkin's real-life friend, Diana Gollancz, and recount her preparations for a fashionable party.

Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to the gaze of the customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles. Madonna is dressed in a black bustier, spike heels, fishnets, revealing her new slimmed down body at that time. She begins the video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes, revealing her short bleached hair. The bluish and dark lighting reveals her look as a mix of actresses Marlene Dietrich in the movie The Blue Angel as well as Liza Minnelli as the character Sally Bowles in the Bob Fosse-directed musical film, Cabaret.|$|E

500|$|Deciding {{to shift}} her focus to acting, Love {{enrolled}} at the San Francisco Art Institute and studied film with George Kuchar. Love featured {{in one of his}} short films, titled Club Vatican. In 1985 she submitted an audition tape for the role of Nancy Spungen in the Sid Vicious biopic Sid and Nancy (1986), and was given a minor supporting role by director Alex Cox. After filming Sid and Nancy in New York City, she worked at <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> show in Times Square and squatted at the ABC No Rio social center and Pyramid Club in the East Village. The same year, Cox cast her in a leading role in his film Straight to Hell (1987), a spaghetti western starring Joe Strummer and Grace Jones filmed in Spain in 1986. The film caught the attention of Andy Warhol, who featured Love in an episode of Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes with Robbie Nevil in a segment titled [...] "C'est la Vie". She also had a part in the 1988 Ramones music video for [...] "I Wanna Be Sedated", appearing as a bride among dozens of party guests.|$|E
500|$|The east front {{bedroom is}} divided in two with a partition, giving {{the eastern side}} of the {{building}} four rooms on the second floor, with the two middle rooms being used as medium-security cells. The maximum security cells were located in the back of the building, in the south-east corner. These cells are constructed of wood and walled in by stone walls and iron doors. The maximum security cells had no heat, light or bathrooms; air was only able to flow into the room through a slit in the stone wall and <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> hole in the iron door. Underneath the cells were two courses of [...] by [...] timbers superimposed on top of one another. These timbers are believed to have been sourced from the original 1792 jail.

As part of the alterations made by the Society, the solid brick wall was removed and is now supported by steel beams.|$|E
500|$|Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone {{asserted}} that [...] "This is 100 percent {{having to do}} with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem—and he's cashed plenty of checks—with our show making fun of Christians." [...] According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had [...] "heard <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well." [...] According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.|$|E

Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul.

Then, as a way of reducing the number of peeps on the screen, he decided that if <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> encountered a piece of blank, flat land, it would build a house, and that a larger area of land would enable <b>a</b> <b>peep</b> to build a larger house. Thus the core mechanics – god-like intervention and the desire for peeps to expand – were created.|$|E
