5|$|The <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> {{occupies}} the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is unlikely {{to be more than a}} thousandth of that of Earth. The <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is the second-most-massive and second-largest {{body in the}} <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> {{after the}} dwarf planet Ceres, and it {{contributes}} an estimated 9% {{of the mass of}} the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly {{between the}} orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is {{occupied}} by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is also termed the main <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half {{the mass of the}} belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200km).|$|E
25|$|More than 50 {{binaries}} {{are known}} {{in each of}} the main groupings: near-Earth <b>asteroids,</b> <b>belt</b> <b>asteroids,</b> and trans-Neptunian objects, not including numerous claims based solely on light-curve variation.|$|R
50|$|Researchers Rebecca Martin and Mario Livio have {{proposed}} that <b>asteroid</b> <b>belts</b> may tend to form {{in the vicinity of}} the frost line, due to nearby giant planets disrupting planet formation inside their orbit. By analysing the temperature of warm dust found around some 90 stars, they concluded that the dust (and therefore possible <b>asteroid</b> <b>belts)</b> was typically found close to the frost line.|$|R

5|$|Asteroids in the <b>{{asteroid}}</b> <b>belt</b> {{are divided}} into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. The <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> also contains main-belt comets, {{which may have been}} the source of Earth's water.|$|E
5|$|Juno, minor-planet {{designation}} 3 Juno in the Minor Planet Center catalogue system, is {{an asteroid}} in the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b> Juno {{was the third}} asteroid discovered, in 1804, by German astronomer Karl Harding. It is the 11th-largest asteroid, {{and one of the}} two largest stony (S-type) asteroids, along with 15 Eunomia. It is estimated to contain 1% of the total mass of the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

5|$|Vesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, {{within the}} <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> with {{a period of}} 3.6 Earth years, {{specifically}} in the inner <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> interior to the Kirkwood gap at 2.50AU. Its orbit is moderately inclined (i = 7.1°, compared to 7° for Mercury and 17° for Pluto) and moderately eccentric (e = 0.09, {{about the same as}} for Mars).|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have {{swept across the}} <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|NASA's ongoing {{investigations}} include in-depth surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) and Saturn and {{studies of the}} Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b> NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini(1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).|$|E

25|$|It is {{the only}} model that {{explains}} the twinning of planets (and moons), but also explains coplanar and circular orbits, angular momentum distribution, the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belts,</b> the small size and orbital anomalies of Mars and Mercury, and the late heavy bombardments.|$|R

5|$|Of all the {{measured}} parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity {{is the most}} uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity is inconsistent {{with the presence of}} the proposed <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> at a distance of 3AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.|$|E
5|$|Skirting {{the outer}} edge of the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is the Cybele group, {{orbiting}} between 3.3 and 3.5AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions. Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> this usually is not the case. As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions. Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity.|$|E

5|$|The inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a {{radius of}} 2.5AU inward, {{appears to be}} clear of dust down to the {{detection}} limit of the 6.5m MMT telescope. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while {{the presence of a}} planetary system may also help keep this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> may be present with a combined mass no greater than the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{terrestrial}} region, between 2 and 4AU from the Sun, is called the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b> The <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically. Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over {{such a large}} volume {{that it would be}} {{improbable}} to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the available sample of lightcurves for 26 Trojan and Hilda <b>asteroids</b> with <b>belt</b> <b>asteroid</b> lightcurves shows the former to be distinguished by {{a higher incidence of}} high amplitudes rgan <b>belt</b> <b>asteroids</b> of comparable size, suggesting more elongated shapes; they currently have, moreover, only a few percent of the main-belt asteroids' collision frequency. A more modest collisional evolution that may have affected the relative degree of fragmentation of these bodies, and thus their shapes, is inferred...|$|R
5000|$|... 437 Rhodia is a Main <b>belt</b> <b>asteroid</b> {{that was}} {{discovered}} by French astronomer Auguste Charlois on 16 July 1898 in Nice. It has the highest albedo of any main <b>belt</b> <b>asteroid.</b>|$|R
5|$|Juno {{is one of}} {{the larger}} asteroids, perhaps tenth by size and {{containing}} approximately 1% the mass of the entire <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b> It is the second-most-massive S-type asteroid after 15 Eunomia. Even so, Juno has only 3% the mass of Ceres.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
