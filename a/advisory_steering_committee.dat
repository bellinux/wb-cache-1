40|$|One {{could argue}} that good project {{governance}} positively influences productivity, and that this shapes the economy in a sustainable way. However, there is a prevailing perception in the corporate and government environment that <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> and boards in some way constitutes good project governance. This perception appears to be based in part upon the presumption that the corporate sector always performs better than government; the corporate sector assures good corporate governance through boards; Ergo everyone else, including government, would perform better if they did the same. The paper argues that this presumption is indefensible {{as there is no}} scientific or rational basis to support it. Moreover, the concept of governance as <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> and boards can diffuse responsibility and accountability in the hierarchical structures of government departments and large organisations that initiate their own projects and this can lead to project delay, confusion and uncertainty. The paper reviews the literature on governance and project <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> and concludes that establishing project <b>advisory</b> rather than <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> removes the potential for organisational power play and provides an effective consultation mechanism that facilitates 'best for project' outcomes. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{costs of}} the {{external}} audit process should be borne directly by the radiological unit unless the organisation of audits is carried out through a directly funded government body. The unit to be audited should foster an open and constructive atmosphere amongst its staff towards the process. Emphasis {{should be placed on}} avoiding misunderstanding or confusion with other quality assessment activities. The guidelines suggest that a special national or regional <b>advisory</b> group, or <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> of clinical experts, independent of the auditing organisations, may prove useful in the overall coordination and development of clinical audit implementation, criteria and procedures. The group should preferably be established by the Health Ministry or other government organisation in order to ensure appropriate authority and financing. The role of professional/scientific societies, it is suggested, can be of great value in developing standards of good practice and in providing practical advice, stimulus and support for the establishment of appropriate clinical audit organisations.|$|R
