40|$|Process cheese {{models were}} {{prepared}} by blending acid or rennet casein, milk fat, sodium chloride, 2. 5 % emulsifying salt {{and water and}} heating to 80 C. <b>Acid</b> <b>casein</b> cheese models were subjected to sodium hydroxide conditioning at 65 C in the cooker. Model process cheeses were acidified with lactic acid and treated by addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein, four different emulsifying salts and sodium oxalate. Meltability and toughness of the model cheese increased to a maximum with increased sodium hydroxide conditioning of <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> to pH 7. 20. These same properties decreased with addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein to both casein cheese models. Loss of emulsion occurred during the meltability test of rennet casein cheese models with 3. 0 and 4. 5 % added whey protein. Emulsifying salts affected the models differently. Disodium phosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate in rennet casein models eliminated the melting property. These same salts in <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> models produced excellent meltability. Trisodium citrate produced cheeses with good meltability in both acid and rennet casein cheese models. <b>Acid</b> <b>casein</b> cheese models prepared with sodium aluminum phosphate had fair meltability and were very tender (no rupture upon compression). Chelation of calcium by sodium oxalate in rennet casein cheese emulsified with disodium phosphate or tetrasodium pyrophosphate improved meltability with a corresponding increase in toughness.

To determinate total bacterial contamination of <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> edible, isolate and identify pathological microorganisms. 1. To determine the general bacterial contamination of edible <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> samples. 2. To determine the influence of thermophylic bacteria on the general bacterial contamination. 3.

Micro flora of crude milk constitutes certain part of micro flora, found in powdered milk. However, the increased level of general contamination and coliform germs shows the signs of secondary contamination. The enlarged bacteriological contamination, which exceeded the preset limit of 3. 0 x 104 CFU/g, was identified in 3 per cent of analyzed <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> edible samples. This was caused by impurity of crude milk. During the <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> edible casein production process, the temperature of pasteurization was reached twice and in addition to that, comparatively low pH was maintained. These conditions are not hospitable for microorganisms to survive through the production process and remain alive in the final products. The number of thermophylic germs in analyzed samples made up to 19. 79 per cent of bacteria number of bacteria impurity in average. Moreover, there were samples, where the number of thermophylic germs made up from 46. 09 per cent to 66. 95 per cent of total bacterial count contamination...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to investigate the}} effects of key processing steps in the industrial production of <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> on the characteristics and functionality of sodium caseinate with particular emphasis on analytical/functionality testing and seasonal/lactational effects on the original milk. The main conclusions were as follows: The most significant result indicates that drying and concentration after washing of the <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> curd are responsible for alterations in the structure of casein, which result in sodium caseinates with different properties. This was confirmed in the case of two <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> plants investigated which showed similar results even though using different washing and drying technologies. This difference due to the drying step may be further amplified depending upon whether commercial sodium caseinate is manufactured from <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> in the dried or wet curd state. The analytical and functional testing methodology adapted in our laboratory proved effective in predicting the effects of processing steps on the functionality of sodium caseinate. In particular, the ability to detect the presence of aggregate formation was particularly important. The database generated subsequently helped an <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> manufacturer in modifying its process(es) to manufacture experimental sodium caseinate for specific food end-uses. Progress was greatly facilitated by the collaboration of individual manufacturers in the sourcing of problem samples from previously manufactured codes, and facilitating access to process plant during production. In a commercial application of the database, confidential work was undertaken on behalf of a client. Experimentally-produced sodium caseinate ingredients were evaluated using our adapted functionality testing methods and based on the results, the company was able to modify its process(es) to produce sodium caseinates with functionality for specific food end-users. It was concluded that while processing parameters in the production of <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> can {{have a significant effect on}} the functional behaviour of the resultant sodium caseinate, the ability to assess this change in functional behaviour, through relevant functional testing, was equally important.

In addition, RSM allowed multiresponse optimization of <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> production using unique and newly developed optimization techniques. In order to simplify the process, an extruder die was designed to assist with the dewheying process, however, plugging problems occurred due to screw design limitations.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} studied {{the effects of}} cysteine, whey powder, whey protein concentrate, <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> hydrolysates, or tryptone on the viability of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria. Changes in pH, titratable acidity, redox potential, and viability of bacteria were monitored during 24 h of fermentation and refrigerated storage (4 °C) of yogurt for 35 d. The incubation time that was needed to reach pH 4. 5 was considerably affected by the added ingredients. Also, the drop in pH or the increase in acidity and redox potential was dependent on the added ingredients. The addition of cysteine, whey protein concentrate, <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> hydrolysates, or tryptone improved the viability of bifidobacteria to a variable extent, but whey powder failed to improve their viability.

They showed that Neisseria intracellu-laris and Neisseria gonorrhoeae grow on a relatively simplified medium (as com-pared to previous routine media) containing an <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> hydrolyzate, meat infusion, starch, and agar. Their results led to the following conclusions: (1) neisseriae can be grown on a medium in which acid hydrolyzate of casein is used in place of the complicated proteins and peptones usually present in diagnostic media; (2) growth factors present in meat infusion are probably nec-essary for the growth; (3) special physical conditions must be established in the medium. Neisseriae do not grow in the same medium if the starch constituent has previously been broken down by acid or enzyme action. Frantz (1942) announced that Neisseria intracellularis grows in a simple synthetic medium containing glutamic acid, cystine, glucose, and mineral salts. Our study of the growth of Neisseria intracellularis was undertaken after the appearance of Mueller and Hinton's publication (1941). The purpose of our work was to test their results, to simplify the medium if possible, and by this means to obtain information concerning the metabolic processes of neisseriae. We propose to restrict our discussion mainly to aspects in which our results diverge from those of the earlier investigators...|$|E
40|$|Skim milk was reconstituted {{to obtain}} milk with 8. 44 % DM, which was {{standardized}} with demineralized whey powder (DWP) to obtain milk sample A (9. 71 % DM) and milk sample B (10. 75 % DM). Milk samples were heat treated at 85 ºC/ 20 min and 90 ºC/ 10 min, respectively. Untreated milk {{was used as}} control. Milk samples were inoculated with 2. 5 % of commercial yogurt culture (containing Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in the ratio 1 : 1) at 43 ºC. Samples were incubated until pH 4. 6 was reached. Samples were immediately cooled to 4 ºC and held at that temperature until analyses. Samples of <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> gels were stirred after 1, 7 and 14 days of storage. Measurements of viscosity were done with Brookfield DV-E Viscometer. Spindle No 3 at 30 rpm was used for all samples. Duration of fermentation decreased when DWP was used for standardization of milk dry matter content. Yogurt samples produced from milk heat treated at 85 ºC/ 20 min, obtained by stirring of gel 1 day after production had a higher viscosity than sample produced from milk heat treated at 90 ºC/ 10 min. On the other hand, samples produced from milk heat treated at 90 ºC/ 10 min had a greater viscosity after 7 and 14 days of storage, which indicates a greater hydrophilic properties and a more pronounced swelling of casein micelles...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental {{aspects of}} casein drying have been {{investigated}} to provide relevant information for design, operation and control of industrial casein driers. Casein desorption isotherms were sigmoid in shape and of type II according to the BET classification. A modified Henderson equation could describe the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of casein {{as a function of}} water activity (equilibrium relative humidity) and temperature. Under similar drying conditions, the EMC of casein decreased in the order mineral acid > rennet > lactic. Studies on mineral <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> indicated that the EMC was not affected by wet processing conditions but more severe drying conditions caused a significant decrease. Drying mechanisms were studied in a laboratory tunnel drier and a fluidized bed drier. The batch drying curve in the tunnel drier consisted of a short constant rate period (CRP) and two linear falling rate periods (FRP). The critical moisture content was about 1. 5 kg water/kg dry solids. In contrast the batch drying curve in the fluidized bed drier had a long constant rate period down to a critical moisture content of around 0. 5 kg water/kg dry solids, followed by a single linear falling rate period. The effects of drying conditions and casein manufacturing conditions were studied in the fluidized bed drier. The CRP drying rate was directly proportional to the air temperature driving force. The FRP drying rate also increased with an increase in air temperature. An increase in air velocity caused an increase in the CRP drying rate but did not affect the drying rate in the FRP. A rise in casein precipitation pH from 4. 3 to 4. 8 caused a significant reduction in the CRP drying rate but had only a small effect on the FRP drying rate. The precipitation and hot wash temperatures of casein curd had no significant effect on the drying rates. Curd plasticization did not affect the drying rate in the CRP but increased the FRP drying rate. In the CRP, larger particles (> 2. 00 mm) tended to dry more slowly than smaller particles because of reduced fluidization efficiency, but particle sizes ranging from 0. 50 to 3. 35 mm did not appear to affect drying rates in the FRP. In general the CRP was affected by factors which altered the gas phase heat and mass transfer whereas the FRP tended to be influenced by factors affecting the solid phase heat and mass transfer. Measurements in a commercial plant indicated that bigger casein particles leaving the drier had significantly higher moisture contents than the smaller particles. Moisture equilibration between the big and small particles was reached in about 3 hours. Studies on drying of single casein particles indicated that lactic casein particles had higher air contents than rennet casein and mineral <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> particles when drying from a mean initial MC of 1. 2 kg water/kg dry solids to a final MC of 0. 02 kg water/kg dry solids. This caused particle shrinkage of about 40 % for all three types of casein which was brought about by both evaporation of moisture and contraction of the casein matrix. Below about 0. 40 kg water/kg solids, the casein matrix no longer contracted significantly and the voids left by the evaporating moisture became air pores. A pulsed NMR technique was used to obtain the self diffusion coefficient (D) and transverse relaxation time (T 2) of water in mineral acid, lactic and rennet casein particles, as well as the moisture distribution images within mineral <b>acid</b> <b>casein</b> particles. The self diffusion coefficient and transverse relaxation time for all casein types decreased with decreasing moisture content. But at the same moisture content the T 2 values for acid caseins were much higher than for rennet casein. This may be attributed to the extra mineral content of rennet casein. The maximum self diffusion coefficient of water within a casein particle was about 25 % that of pure water. The T 2 of pure water was about 200 times that for acid caseins and 750 times for rennet casein. Moisture equilibration between particles took about 3 hours to reach an equilibrium D value which compares well with the value above. The proton density image within a wet casein particle showed regions of high moisture content and some regions of very low moisture content which may be air gaps. The effects of temperature and time on casein colour and casein solubility in alkali were studied for a range of moisture contents. In general low moisture samples were more soluble than high moisture samples. However for holding temperatures up to 100 °C and holding time up to 2 hours, the maximum insolubility of casein occurred at a moisture concent of around 0. 43 kg water/kg dry solids. Casein colour was not affected by holding temperatures of up to 100 °C at holding times of up to one hour. However a 2 hour holding time at 100 °C caused severe discoloration of casein. The implications of these results for commercial casein drying are discussed and a new design concept for casein dry processing is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Three cDNA clones {{encoding}} isoforms of casein kinase I (CKI) {{were isolated}} from Arabidopsis thaliana. One full-length clone, designated CKI 1, contained an {{open reading frame}} of 1371 bp encoding a protein of 51, 949 D with an isoelectric point of 9. 7. In addition to the highly conserved catalytic domain (of about 300 amino acids), the Arabidopsis CKI isoforms contain 150 to 180 amino acid carboxyl-terminal extensions, which show among themselves {{a lower level of}} sequence conservation. These extensions do not show any sequence similarity to nonplant CKI isoforms, such as rat testis CKI delta, which is their closest isolated homolog, or to yeast CKI isoforms. Three additional isoforms of Arabidopsis CKI were found in the data bases of expressed sequence tags and/or were isolated serendipitously in nonspecific screening procedures by others. One of them also shows a carboxyl-terminal extension, but of only 80 amino <b>acids.</b> <b>Casein</b> kinase activity was detected in the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli strains expressing the CKI 1 protein. This activity showed the crucial properties of CKI, including the ability to phosphorylate the D 4 peptide, a specific substrate of CKI, and inhibition by N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 5 -chloroisoquinoline- 8 -sulfonamide, a specific CKI inhibitor. Like several recombinant CKI isoforms from yeast, CKI 1 was able to phosphorylate tyrosine-containing acidic polymers...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} Bushen Gubiao Recipe (BGR), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) signaling pathway and CD 4 +CD 25 +foxp 3 +regulatory T cells (CD 4 +CD 25 +foxp 3 +Tregs) in mice with recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs). Methods: A mouse model of kidney-yang deficiency which simulated physical characteristics of RRTIs was established by intraperitoneal injection of hydrocortisone for 14 d. The model mice were divided into 4 groups, model group, high-dose BGR group, low-dose BGR group, and nucleic <b>acid</b> and <b>casein</b> oral solution group. They were administered respectively with distilled water, high-dose BGR (50 g/kg body weight), low-dose BGR (25 g/kg body weight) and nucleic <b>acid</b> and <b>casein</b> oral solution. Besides, a normal control group was set up and gastrogavaged with distilled water. The effect of intervention was evaluated 4 weeks later by estimating the changes in behaviors of mice. Expressions of TLR 4 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p 65 in lung tissue were detected by immunohistochemical SABC method, the expression of TLR 4 mRNA in lung tissue was detected by fluorescence quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR), {{and the level of}} blood CD 4 +CD 25 +foxp 3 + Tregs was determined by flow cytometry. Results: A kidney-yang deficiency mouse model with RRTIs was successfully established by intraperitoneal injection of hydrocortisone. BGR could improve the abnormal behavioral condition of the mice and enhance the expressions of TLR 4 and NF-κB p 65 in the lung tissue. Expression of TLR 4 mRNA in high-dose BGR group was higher than that in model group (P< 0. 05), while the difference was not statistically significant between high-dose BGR group and low-dose BGR group (P＞ 0. 05). Levels of CD 4 +CD 25 +foxp 3 +Tregs in high-dose BGR group and nucleic <b>acid</b> and <b>casein</b> oral solution group were lower than that in model group (P< 0. 05), while the difference was not statistically significant between high-dose BGR group and low-dose BGR group (P＞ 0. 05). Conclusion: BGR can improve the behavior of the kidney-yang deficiency mice, and improve the innate immune function by up-regulating TLR/NF-κB signaling pathway. BGR can adjust the immune imbalance of T-helper cell (Th) 1 /Th 2 through reducing the activity of CD 4 + CD 25 +foxp 3 +Tregs and enhancing the immune response of Th 1 type...|$|R
