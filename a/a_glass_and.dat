5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{designed}} by the City of Chicago. The station house is at ground level and is set back from the street. It has <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> steel façade, and most features within the station house are either made of stainless steel or painted white. The station's island platform is accessible from the station house via stairs, escalators, and an elevator. The platform serves the Orange Line's two tracks; the track to the Loop is located to the south, and the track to Midway located to the north. A canopy covers the entire platform. A bus terminal is located {{to the north of}} the station. To the west of the bus terminal and north of the railroad tracks is the Pulaski park and ride lot. The park and ride lot has 390 spaces which cost $4 for 12 hours and is operated by Standard Parking.|$|E

25|$|The Crown is a {{hotel that}} serves as the meeting place of the British Union of Fascists; as its name implies, the hotel is {{dominated}} by an enormous crown. The BUF members have a reputation of being violent thugs; a fight involving members of the party takes place outside and within the hotel. A second hotel, the Silver Eagle, is the location of the Medieval English Association conference; it bears <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> steel eagle on its top. Both hotels are modern, glass-fronted structures.|$|E

25|$|Like {{most other}} things in Wolfe's life, his beer {{drinking}} is bound by ritual. Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers the bottles unopened; Wolfe uncaps the bottles himself, using an 18-carat gold bottle opener {{given to him by}} a satisfied client. He never drinks directly from the bottle, but instead pours the beer into <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> lets the foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer of his desk, where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.|$|E
25|$|The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court is {{a covered}} square at {{the centre of}} the British Museum {{designed}} by the engineers Buro Happold and the architects Foster and Partners. The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company, with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At {{the centre of the}} Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} has received positive critical reception, and this popularity {{has led to}} her being featured in several promotional efforts and merchandise of the series. An Akihabara Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? lottery features a figure of Hestia as the grand prize, with other prizes including Hestia-themed cushions, desk mats, scarf towels, <b>a</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>and</b> one of three badges. Another figure from Good Smile Company also features Hestia, with the character striking a pose reminiscent of the anime's promotional images. Good Smile Company has made a second, Nendoroid version of a Hestia figure, which comes with three expressions: smiling, confident, and upset. Additional action figures, including a 26cm one by Hobby Japan and a Hestia figure in the chibi-style figurine line Cu-poche by Japanese figure company Kotobukiya also exist.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the atomic}} {{structure}} of glass shares {{characteristics of the}} structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature. A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it is below the freezing point of the material, {{and in some cases}} will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.|$|E
25|$|The new Haussmann boulevards created {{space for}} new stores, {{and it became}} easier for {{customers}} to cross the city to shop. In a short time, the commerce in novelties, fabrics and clothing began to be concentrated in a few very large department stores. Bon Marché was opened in 1852 by Aristide Boucicaut, {{the former chief of}} the Petit Thomas variety store, in a modest building. His venture expanded rapidly, its income growing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Boucicaut commissioned a new building with <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> iron framework designed in part by Gustave Eiffel. It opened in 1869 and became the model for the modern department store. The Grand Magasin du Louvre opened in 1855 inside the vast luxury hotel built by the Péreire brothers next to the Louvre and the Place Royale. It was the first department store that concentrated on luxury goods, and tried both to provide bargains and be snobbish. Other department stores quickly appeared: Printemps in 1865, the Grand Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville (BHV) in 1869, and La Samaritaine in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.|$|E

25|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of the campus, at 164th Street and Goethals Avenue, is the power plant for the hospital. The two-story Art Deco brick building was completed in 1932, built along with the original Queens General Hospital, and was considered a modern facility {{at the time of its}} construction. One of its most notable features is its large chimney. Adjacent to the west between 160th and 161st Streets is the Queens Gateway to Health Sciences Secondary School, a grades 6–12 public school. Adjacent to the west of the school is FDNY EMS Station 50, opened in July 2016, which dispatches FDNY ambulances and contains the Queens EMS Borough Command Center. The EMS station, designed by Dean-Wolf Architects, has <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> aluminum outer facade, a steel frame, and a concrete foundation with a cantilever shape due to the topography of the area. It is the largest EMS station in the borough. Another EMS station and medical examiner building, and storage and utility buildings were previously located along Goethals Avenue (see below). At the western end of the block on Parsons Boulevard adjacent to Building T is a storage garage, built in 1957.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the bedside table stood <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E
25|$|Mohnke {{was born}} in Lübeck on 15 March 1911. His father, who shared his name with his son, was a cabinetmaker. After his father's death, {{he went to work}} for <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> {{porcelain}} manufacturer, eventually reaching a management position. He also held a degree in economics. Mohnke joined the Nazi Party with number 649,684 on 1 September 1931. Shortly thereafter, he joined the SS with number 15,541. Mohnke began with the rank of SS-Mann (private). After Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, SS Headquarters in Berlin requested that all SS regiments submit three names of their best soldiers for transfer to a personal guard unit for Hitler. Mohnke was selected for the unit in March 1933. He was assigned to SS-Stabswache Berlin, which established its first guard at the original Reich Chancellery. By August, Mohnke was one of two company commanders. In September, the unit became known as the SS-Sonderkommando Berlin after the training units SS-Sonderkommando Zossen and SS-Sonderkommando Jüterbog merged with it under Dietrich's command. With the merger, Mohnke was transferred to the 2nd Battalion and given command of the 3rd Company.|$|E
