40|$|The {{mechanisms}} for how saturated fat and sugar-based beverages contribute to human obesity are poorly understood. This paper describes {{a series of}} experiments developed to examine the response of hypothalamic neuropeptides to diets rich in sugar and fat, using three different diets: a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) choice diet with access to chow, saturated fat and a 30 % sugar solution; <b>a</b> high-fat (HF) <b>choice</b> diet with access to chow and saturated fat; or to <b>a</b> high-sugar (HS) <b>choice</b> diet with access to chow and a sugar solution. We first studied caloric intake, body weight gain, hormonal alterations and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression when male Wistar rats were subjected to <b>an</b> HFHS <b>choice,</b> <b>an</b> HF <b>choice</b> or <b>an</b> HS <b>choice</b> diet for 1 week. Next, we studied caloric intake and body weight gain when rats were subjected to the choice diets for 5 weeks. Finally, we measured neuropeptide expression in hepatic vagotomized rats subjected to <b>an</b> HFHS <b>choice,</b> <b>an</b> HF <b>choice</b> or <b>an</b> HS <b>choice</b> diet for 1 week. In rats on <b>an</b> HF <b>choice</b> diet, plasma leptin concentrations and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA increased and neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA decreased. Rats on <b>an</b> HFHS <b>choice</b> diet showed identical plasma leptin concentrations as rats on <b>an</b> HF <b>choice</b> diet. However, NPY mRNA increased and POMC mRNA decreased. An HS choice diet for 1 week did not alter hypothalamic neuropeptide expression or plasma leptin concentrations. As hormonal changes did not explain the differences in hypothalamic neuropeptide expression between rats on the choice diets, we addressed whether neuronal feedback signals mediated the hypothalamic neuropeptide response. The POMC mRNA response to different diets depended on an intact innervation of liver and upper intestinal tract. Our {{data suggest that the}} specific combination of saturated fat and a 30 % sugar solution results in hyperphagia-induced obesity and alters hypothalamic neuropeptide expression, and that the response of the melanocortin system is mediated by the hepatic vagu...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the question of}} implementability of <b>a</b> social <b>choice</b> function in <b>a</b> classical setting where the preferences of finitely many selfish individuals with private information have to be aggregated towards <b>a</b> social <b>choice.</b> This {{is one of the}} central questions in mechanism design. If the concept of weak implementation is considered, the Revelation Principle states that one can restrict attention to truthful implementations and direct revelation mechanisms, which implies that implementability of <b>a</b> social <b>choice</b> function is “easy” to check. For the concept of strong implementation, however, the Revelation Principle becomes invalid, and the complexity of deciding whether <b>a</b> given social <b>choice</b> function is strongly implementable has been open so far. In this paper, we show by using methods from polyhedral theory that strong implementability of <b>a</b> social <b>choice</b> function can be decided in polynomial space and that each of the payments needed for strong implementation can always be chosen to be of polynomial encoding length. Moreover, we show that strong implementability of <b>a</b> social <b>choice</b> function involving only a single selfish individual can be decided in polynomial time via linear programming...|$|R
