Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left <b>a</b> <b>stigma</b> attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.|$|E

He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the New Court Argus was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the New Court Argus suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and affix <b>a</b> <b>stigma</b> to them.|$|E
5|$|The many stamens are {{arranged}} in two series, which is a distinctive characteristic of the genus. The inner stamens are fused at the base to form a short tubular structure. The outer stamens arise from along the floral tube. The style is usually dark red and has <b>a</b> <b>stigma</b> with 6–8 lobes; the style plus stigma is roughly the same length as the stamens. If the flower is fertilized, a fleshy fruit forms, either smooth or with ribs. The brown or black seeds are about 1mm in diameter.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of stigma {{position}} and size on seed productivity through pollination efficiency in radish, the numbers of self and cross pollen grains on the stigmas and the seed productivity under insect-pollination were compared among four bred lines. Lines with <b>a</b> small <b>stigma</b> or <b>a</b> high <b>stigma</b> relative to the anthers on long stamens tended to receive fewer self and total (self + cross) pollen grains but showed a higher cross-pollination percentage (ratio of cross pollen grains to total pollen grains on stigmas) than those with <b>a</b> large <b>stigma</b> or <b>a</b> lower <b>stigma.</b> Additionally, <b>a</b> higher cross-pollination percentage was associated with a higher outcrossing percentage. This result suggests that variations in the two stigma traits affect the outcrossing percentage via the cross-pollination percentage. Therefore, {{it should be possible to}} prevent loss of F 1 purity by selecting new parental lines with floral morphology that favors cross-pollination percentage...|$|R

25|$|Thinking of virginity as <b>a</b> <b>stigma</b> disempowered many boys {{because they}} felt deeply ashamed and often tried {{to hide the fact}} that they were virgins from their partners, which for some {{resulted}} in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as <b>a</b> <b>stigma</b> did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as <b>a</b> <b>stigma,</b> these girls believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it easier for them to lose their virginity once they wanted to {{because they felt}} society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance between boys and girls because these individuals felt less affected by other people and were more in control of their individual sexual experience. Adolescent boys, however, were more likely than adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.|$|E
25|$|In many cultures, {{inability}} to conceive bears <b>a</b> <b>stigma.</b> In closed social groups, {{a degree of}} rejection (or {{a sense of being}} rejected by the couple) may cause considerable anxiety and disappointment.

25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, <b>a</b> <b>stigma,</b> or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as <b>a</b> <b>stigma.</b> In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not feel like they actually received what they expected in return and this made them feel like they had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.|$|E

25|$|In {{plants with}} SI, when a pollen grain {{produced}} in a plant reaches <b>a</b> <b>stigma</b> {{of the same}} plant or another plant with a similar genotype, the process of pollen germination, pollen-tube growth, ovule fertilization and embryo development is halted at one of its stages and consequently no seeds are produced.

50|$|After rediscovering Mendel's laws of heredity, which {{apply to}} {{chromosomal}} inheritance, he undertook experiments {{with the four}} o'clock (Mirabilis jalapa) to investigate apparent counterexamples to Mendel's laws in the heredity of variegated (green and white mottled) leaf color. Correns found that, while Mendelian traits behave independently of {{the sex of the}} source parent, leaf color depended greatly on which parent had which trait. For instance, pollinating an ovule from a white branch with pollen from another white area resulted in white progeny, the predicted result for a recessive gene. Green pollen used on <b>a</b> green <b>stigma</b> resulted in all green progeny, the expected result for a dominant gene. However, if green pollen fertilized <b>a</b> white <b>stigma,</b> the progeny were white, but if the sexes of the donors were reversed (white pollen on <b>a</b> green <b>stigma),</b> the progeny were green.|$|R

25|$|Diagnosis of obstructive {{sleep apnea}} is {{significantly}} more common among people in relationships, who are alerted to their condition by being informed by their sleeping partner since individuals with {{obstructive sleep apnea}} are often unaware of the condition.

25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a pollen grain produced by the anther, the male part of a flower, must be transferred to <b>a</b> <b>stigma,</b> the female part of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other seed plants). In angiosperms, after the pollen grain has landed on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the micropyle and fertilise it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E

25|$|During {{the time}} of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, {{conversion}} to Roman Catholicism did not result in total termination of the person's Jewish status. Legally, the converts were no longer regarded as Jews, and thus allowed to stay in the Iberian Peninsula.
