5|$|In mid-1975, Ochs {{took on the}} {{identity}} of John Butler Train. He told people that Train had murdered Ochs, and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Train was convinced that someone {{was trying to kill}} him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, <b>a</b> <b>knife,</b> <b>or</b> a lead pipe.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May 1940, Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV)—later to become known as the Home Guard. Far more men volunteered than the government expected {{and by the end of}} June, there were nearly 1.5million volunteers. There were plenty of personnel for the defence of the country, but there were no uniforms (a simple armband had to suffice) and equipment was in critically short supply. At first, the Home Guard was armed with guns in private ownership, <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> bayonet on a pole, Molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers.|$|E

5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy javelins) and hastae (thrusting spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and thrusting, as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, slashing sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two javelins and a curved slashing sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, javelins and possibly <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E

On a CDMA network, however, the phone connects to the network using an ESN. All prior models have used regular mini-SIM cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> scissors so that it fits into the micro-SIM tray.|$|E
25|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} artistic technique in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike wood engraving where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe beechwood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of cherry wood was popular.|$|E
25|$|The corpse {{was badly}} decomposed, {{although}} the pathologist who examined Fleszar's remains {{was able to}} determine the young woman had been stabbed approximately 30 times {{in the chest and}} abdomen with <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> other sharp object, that her feet had been severed just above the ankle, the thumb and sections of the fingers of one hand were missing, and that one forearm had been severed from her body (these severed appendages were never found). Despite the advanced state of decomposition, the pathologist was also able to locate multiple lineal abrasions upon the victim's chest and torso, indicating that Fleszar had been extensively beaten before her death. Although police theorized that Fleszar had been raped, the advanced state of decomposition of the corpse had erased any conclusive evidence of sexual assault.|$|E

Lastly, the point may differ in shape: most common is a sharp, triangular point (not pictured), as in <b>a</b> chef's <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> paring <b>knife,</b> though the French point (also called [...] "Sheep's foot") is common in santokus, and a round point is sometimes found on long slicing knives.|$|R
25|$|Prevention of snake bites {{can involve}} wearing {{protective}} footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly {{depends on the}} type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with <b>a</b> <b>knife,</b> <b>or</b> using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends {{on the type of}} snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's breathing is sometimes also required.|$|E

500|$|As {{the end of}} 1891 approached, he {{prepared}} a final edition of Leaves of Grass, a version that has been nicknamed the [...] "Deathbed Edition." [...] He wrote, [...] "L. of G. at last complete—after 33 y'rs of hackling at it, all times & moods of my life, fair weather & foul, {{all parts of the}} land, and peace & war, young & old." [...] Preparing for death, Whitman commissioned a granite mausoleum shaped like a house for $4,000 and visited it often during construction.

500|$|Self-harm (SH), also {{referred}} to as self-injury (SI), self-inflicted violence (SIV), nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) or self-injurious behaviour (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviours where demonstrable injury is self-inflicted. The behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent. [...] The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object, e. g. <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> razor blade. The term self-mutilation is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive. Self-inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat. This differs from the common definition of self-harm, as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose. A broader definition of self-harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating.|$|E
500|$|The first {{songs to}} be {{released}} were [...] "I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole" [...] and [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", on Columbia's popular 14000 Race series. Johnson's debut became a substantial success, as 9,400 copies were pressed, more than the latest release by one of Columbia's most established stars, Bessie Smith, and an additional pressing of 6,000 copies followed. His fifth recorded song, [...] "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground", eventually the B-side of Johnson's second release, best exemplifies his unique guitar playing in open D tuning for slide. For the session, Johnson substituted <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> <b>or</b> penknife for the bottleneck and—according to Harris—he played with a thumb pick. His melancholy, indescribable humming of the guitar part creates the impression of [...] "unison moaning", a style of singing hymns that is common in southern African-American church choirs. In 1928, the blues critic Edward Abbe Niles praised Johnson in his column for The Bookman, emphasizing his [...] "violent, tortured, and abysmal shouts and groans, and his inspired guitar playing".|$|E
