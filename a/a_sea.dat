5|$|The ship can {{be moved}} {{horizontally}} and vertically, but not diagonally. The player makes a set number of steps each turn, after which the artificial intelligence does the same for non-playable characters (NPCs). If the player's ship is not docked at a port {{at the end of}} a turn, the player can be attacked by an enemy ship or <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> creature. If they are attacked, a card minigame is triggered to decide if the player loses gold to a rival ship or cargo to <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> creature. The player and NPC draw coloured and numbered cards; the highest-numbered card wins each turn, unless presented against a powerful color. The strongest hue receives an attack bonus. The player's following turn starts after the minigame is completed.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Sea</b> Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>sea</b> anemone {{is capable}} of {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E

How can <b>an</b> <b>SEA</b> {{determine}} {{academic achievement}} {{in terms of}} proficiency of the “all students ” group on the State’s reading/language arts and mathematics assessments combined to develop one list of schools that will enable it to identify the persistently lowest-achieving schools in the State? To determine the persistently lowestachieving schools in the State in terms of academic achievement, <b>an</b> <b>SEA</b> must rank each set of schools—i. e., Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring and secondary schools eligible for, but that do not receive, Title I funds—from highest to lowest in terms of proficiency of the “all students ” group on the State’s reading/language arts and mathematics assessments combined. Accordingly, the <b>SEA</b> must have <b>a</b> way to combine different proficiency rates between reading/language arts and mathematics for each school.

Angry at the abduction of his loved one, Rinaldo enters the boat, which immediately sails off. Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted their cause.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> where the Dnieper River now flows.

The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E

These can be exchanged for gold, which can be used to buy upgrades for the ship. The commodities are stored in the cargo hold, the capacity of which can be upgraded with gold.|$|E
