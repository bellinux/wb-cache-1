This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940, before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 a natural gas pipeline was built across the station, carrying gas from Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the fort's {{conservation}} and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act in 1972. Up to then {{there had been}} growing awareness {{of the significance of}} the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.|$|E
5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard which led to <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; {{for the first time}} they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E

5|$|On September 7, 2005, the mobile-game {{publisher}} Gameloft {{announced that}} they would bring Meteos and Q Entertainment's other puzzle game, Lumines, to cell phones. The game was released on March 30, 2006, as Meteos Astro Blocks. In 2006, Buena Vista Games announced they would publish four Q Entertainment games, including the then-unannounced Meteos: Disney Magic for the Nintendo DS. A sequel to Meteos, Meteos: Disney Magic, developed by Platinum Egg and Aspect Co., follows Meteos basic concept {{with a number of}} changes—most notably, replacing the game's alien species with Disney characters. The Nintendo DS was held sideways, creating a taller playing field on the touchscreen. Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Jack Sparrow, and Winnie the Pooh are featured in the game, whose plot involves restoring order in the storybook vault after its contents are mysteriously rearranged. <b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> gameplay was the ability to drag tiles left and right; in Meteos, tiles could only be moved up and down. Meteos: Disney Magic was released in North America on February 22, 2007, and in Europe on June 1. It had a cooler reception than its predecessor, with a score of 74 out of 100 from Metacritic. Phil Theobald, who also reviewed the first Meteos, while enjoying Disney Magic, thought that the lowered difficulty made it less fun.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolt of}} the Batavi {{appears to have}} led to <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the Roman government's policy on {{deployment}} of Auxilia. The revolt proved that in times of civil strife, when legions were far from their bases campaigning for rival claimants to the imperial throne, it was dangerous to leave provinces exclusively {{in the hands of}} auxiliary regiments recruited from the indigenous nation. During the Julio-Claudian period, auxiliary regiments had often been deployed away from their original home province. But in the Flavian period (69–96), this appears to have become standard policy. Thus in AD 70, 5 reconstituted Batavi regiments (one ala and four cohortes) were transferred to Britain under Petillius Cerialis, who had suppressed the Civilis revolt and then embarked on the governorship of the island. The great majority of regiments probably founded in the 1st century were stationed away from their province of origin in the second e.g. of 13 British regiments recorded in the mid-2nd century, none were stationed in Britain. Furthermore, it appears that in the Flavian era native noblemen were no longer permitted to command auxiliary units from their own tribe.|$|E
5|$|These {{sedentary}} peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing {{logging and}} harvesting of other resources {{on a large}} scale. The construction of irrigation canals {{may have led to}} <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado River basin. Prior to human contact, rivers such as the Gila, Salt and Chaco were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large floodplains. In time, flash floods caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals, which in turn led to the entrenchment of the original streams into arroyos, making agriculture difficult. A variety of methods were employed to combat these problems, including the construction of large dams, but when a megadrought hit the region in the 14thcentury A.D. the ancient civilizations of the Colorado River basin abruptly collapsed. Some Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico and south-central Colorado, becoming the predecessors of the Hopi, Zuni, Laguna and Acoma people in western New Mexico. Many of the tribes that inhabited the Colorado River basin at the time of European contact were descended from Puebloan and Hohokam survivors, while others already had a long history of living in the region or migrated in from bordering lands.|$|E

5|$|For 1654, the Ottomans marshaled their strength: the Arsenal (Tersâne-i Âmire) in the Golden Horn {{produced}} new warships, and squadrons from Tripolitania and Tunis {{arrived to}} strengthen the Ottoman fleet. The strengthened Ottoman fleet that sailed forth from the Dardanelles in early May numbered 79 ships (40 sailing ships, 33 galleys and 6 galleasses), and further 22 galleys from around the Aegean and 14 ships from Barbary stood by to reinforce it off the Straits. This force considerably outnumbered the 26 ships of the Venetian blockade fleet under Giuseppe Dolfin. Although the battle that followed resulted in an Ottoman victory, for the Venetians, given the successful escape of their fleet from the superior Ottoman force, coupled with reports of large Ottomans casualties and the great bravery displayed by the Venetian crews, it counted as a moral victory. The Ottoman fleet, now reinforced by the Aegean and Barbary squadrons, plundered the Venetian island of Tinos, but retreated after only a brief skirmish with the Venetians under Alvise Mocenigo on 21 June. Kara Murad Pasha succeeded in evading the Venetians {{for the remainder of}} the year, with both fleets sailing back and forth in the Aegean, before returning to the Dardanelles in September due to agitation among the fleet's Janissaries. The final months of 1654 were marked by <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the Venetian leadership: Mocenigo died at Candia, and was succeeded as acting Captain General of the Sea by Francesco Morosini, who had distinguished himself in the previous battles.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Thornton {{returned}} to New Zealand {{to serve as}} the Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Army, and this was followed as a term from 1956 to 1958 as its Adjutant General. During this period, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1955, New Zealand {{became a member of the}} South East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and in July 1958, Thornton moved to Bangkok, where he served as head of the Military Planning Office of SEATO. In this capacity, he gained valuable insight in the scenarios in which New Zealand's military might be expected to play a part. The following year he was promoted to acting major general and appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the youngest ever to serve in this role which was effectively the commander of the New Zealand Army. This was to prove a challenging term for Thornton for, driven by the Labour Government, there was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand defence policy. Since the Second World War, defence planning had been based around the concept of an infantry division being raised largely from the Territorial Force. This had now changed to a self-sufficient brigade-sized force made up of a combination of Regular and Territorial Force personnel. While not a policy Thornton personally agreed with, he oversaw the reorganisation that was required to achieve the desired structure and this saw some longstanding regiments being amalgamated. In 1962, part way through his term as CGS, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E

40|$|Muscle fatigue is a {{condition}} where {{the ability of the}} muscle to contract and produce force is reduced. Generally the result of prolonged, relatively strong muscle activity, localized muscle fatigue (LMF) occurs when a muscle or a group of muscles has reduced ability to contract and produce force despite neural stimulation. The causes of physical fatigue include poor workplace practices and lack of regular physical exercise. Signs of fatigue include reduced motivation, blurred vision, increased reflex time and poor concentration – all elements in fatigue-related accidents. Muscle fatigue is a leading cause of workplace and transport-related accidents, as well as work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This thesis reports on an experimental study conducted {{to determine the effects of}} LMF on the physiological signals produced during voluntary isometric and cyclic muscle contraction. Surface electromyography (SEMG) was considered relevant for this research because it is the most practical and non-invasive technique for recording such physiological signals. Time and frequency domain responses were extracted from recorded signals and analysed. Statistical analysis on extracted data was carried out using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non parametric (sign-test) analysis. Sign-test analysis shows <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude both before and after the onset of fatigue during cyclic contraction but no statistically <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> median frequency (MDF). But for isometric contraction the results of sign-test show that there is <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> both MDF and RMS before and after the onset of fatigue. Similarly, ANOVA results suggest that for isometric contraction there is <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> both MDF and RMS before and after the onset of fatigue. In addition, there is <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> RMS amplitude before and after the onset of fatigue during cyclic contraction but no statistically <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> MDF. The results clearly demonstrate that while SEMG analysis is appropriate for muscular fatigue detection, the use of MDF alone does not provide a reliable and valid measure for LMF detection in real world applications where most tasks require a combination of both isometric and cyclic contractions...|$|R
