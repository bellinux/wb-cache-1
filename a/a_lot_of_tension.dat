40|$|Since 1996 (in {{the shadow}} of the reforms of the {{wildlife}} management) numerous hunting concessions were created in Burkina Faso. These concessions function as buffer zones for the nature reserves on the one hand, and contribute to the valorization of the wildlife dedicated to the sustainable development of the country on the other hand. The Burkinabe state, influenced by international environmental politics, aspires to make hunting the principal national revenue, thereby replacing cotton. In 1997, dozens of villages were moved from the northern periphery of park W (at the Burkina side), to give way to a hunting zone, attributed by the state to a private owner. Since then, the application of the forestry code, which regulates the access and utilisation of wildlife and other natural resources on a monetary base, is reinforced. Infractions are prevalent and frequently sanctioned in a repressive manner. This provokes <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>tensions</b> between the different actors, who have different stakes concerning the natural resources and display different strategies in the local arena of environmental politics. In my presentation, I will deal with one of these strategic actors of this local arena: the pisteur. The different functions, strategies and perceptions of the pisteur will be discussed. Pisteurs are local “hunters” with a thorough knowledge of the bush in the protected areas (the park and the hunting zone). The Forestry Service uses them as messenger boys to search and signal poachers, herders who enter in the nature reserves with their cows, wood cutters or producers of charcoal who operate illegally. Meanwhile, the skills of the pisteurs or ‘trackers’ are drawn on by the hunting concessionary for tracing wild animals, which guarantee trophies for the tourists. In this way, pisteurs are the intermediaries between the world of the foresters (national), the world of the villagers (local), and the western world (global), or the embodiment of the interface of local, national and global environmental politics. The pisteur has different faces and his level of success depends on the way he manoeuvres in this interface. He primarily tries to make a living in the new eco-era and masters the gates of what is shown to the outside world (to the foresters and the tourists). The pisteur builds up respect through exhibiting a kind of modern identity, often with a military touch, in line with the image of the forester or uniformed state servant. But at the same time, he is looked down upon by the foresters because of his ascribed quality of being a ‘bushman’ or villager. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|I {{chose to}} design a Juvenile Detention Centre because in a city like Jerusalem that is so {{unstable}} and constantly filled with conflict <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> this <b>tension</b> is bound to effect the youth. This may lead to uncharacteristically violent and anti-social behavior from the children. Therefore {{there needs to be}} a centre set up that can deal with these kids that have lost their way. This Juvenile Detention centre has been designed with a focus on rehabilitation rather than oppression and punishment. The centre has been designed to get de-railed youth back on track rather than continually punishing them, which can lead to them being embedded in a continuing cycle of criminal activity. The main goal of the centre is for the prisoners to leave the centre as mature young men who have the skills and capabilities necessary to contribute to the community. With large spaces and high light penetration the prison takes advantage of its hilltop position, opening its façade to an expansive view of Jerusalem allowing the prisoners to feel a degree of freedom whilst in confinement. This further emphasizes the philosophy of the centre focused on rehabilitation. Constructive activities are encouraged with plenty of space dedicated to productive outlets such as the wood workshop, rooftop garden, classrooms and gym area which is also on the rooftop. The façade works its way from closed confined spaces at one end to very open spaces at the other which is a metaphor for the inmates journey to once again be able to contribute to the community.

50|$|The {{neglect of}} Catholic Mexicans and Mexican Americans by the Catholic Church {{paved the way}} for the Penitente Brotherhood in New Mexico. The Penitente Brotherhood is a catholic lay confraternity that is still active today. The Penitentes believe in three core principles; charity, prayer, and being the good example. In {{addition}} to providing for the community’s religious needs, mutual aid and community charity were at the forefront of their beliefs. The Penitentes came to popularity in New Mexico in the 1820s following Mexican independence. Following independence, the Catholic Church withdrew its clergymen and priests from the area, creating a religious void for the people of New Mexico, which the Penitente Brotherhood filled. The Penitentes have long been a source <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> within the Catholic church, well before their establishment in New Mexico. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> this <b>tension</b> comes from the practice of flagellation, which has historically been a very important idea in folk Catholicism. Flagellation can be defined as flogging or beating, either as a religious discipline, or for sexual gratification. (google definitions) Flagellation can also be done to oneself by oneself, which further complicates the discussion. The Penitente Brotherhood were known for acts of violence against themselves, especially wearing only white cotton trousers with a scarf to hide the lower part of their face, dragging heavy crosses, and whipping themselves. Many of these acts of flagellation occur on each Friday of Lent, throughout holy week, and Fridays between the Holy Week and Pentecost. Furthermore, as the end of Lent nears, these acts of Penitence become more open to the public, primarily at their meeting houses, called Moradas.|$|R

Never happy with the finished song, members Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus regretted the release and lamented {{the fact that it}} peaked lower than previous singles in the charts, not being released at all in the US. They considered the UK to be their most important market, and there it had ended a run of No. 1 hits by stalling at No. 5 - their smallest hit for three years. A full-length version was however still planned for the upcoming album, but ultimately never used. By this time, tensions were growing within the group due to the low productivity of the period, as member Agnetha Faltskog commented; [...] "I can tell from the look in Björn's eyes when he gets home how the day's work has been. Many times the boys have been working for ten hours without coming up with one single note". Andersson talked to a reporter at the time saying; [...] "The prospects are not good.
