40|$|Abstract: Most {{biometric}} {{systems that}} are presently used in real time applications typically use a single biometric characteristic to authenticate the user. A biometric system which is based only on a single biometric identifier in making a personal identification is often not {{able to meet the}} desired performance requirements. Multimodal biometrics is an emerging field of biometric technology, where more than one biometric trait to improve the combined performance. We design a bimodal biometric system which integrates FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face.</b> Hence this paper has focused on the extraction of features from FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and the key points are derived from FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> <b>and</b> then they are clustered using K-Means Algorithm. The centroid, mean and variance of key extracted image of K-Means are stored in the database which is compared with the query FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> features to prove the recognition and authentication. The comparison is based on the XOR operation. Results are performed on the Poly-U FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> database to check the proposed FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> recognition method. It can be used to overcome some of the limitations of a single biometrics, increases the performance...|$|R

5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Texas in {{possession}} of the ball <b>and</b> <b>facing</b> a third down-and-three situation at its 47-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Brown completed a first-down pass to wide receiver Matt Davis at the Tech 47-yard line. After a Texas pass was batted down, Mitchell ran to the left for a gain of two yards. On third down, Brown was pressured by the Virginia Tech defense and threw an interception to Virginia Tech's William Yarborough, who caught the ball at the Tech 31-yard line.|$|E

In three consecutive plays, however, the Hokies only picked up {{a total of four}} yards. Needing six yards to get a touchdown, Virginia Tech sent in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 23-yard field goal. Despite the short distance, Pace missed the kick. With 13:56 remaining in the game, Auburn still held a 16–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{began the}} final quarter of play in {{possession}} of the ball <b>and</b> <b>facing</b> a third down at the Virginia Tech 29-yard line. Needing sevenyards for a first down, the Falcons picked up six. Instead of attempting a field goal on fourth down, DeBerry ordered another fourth-down conversion, which was successful. Three plays later, Tech's defense again forced a fourth down, and again DeBerry ordered a fourth-down conversion. The try was again successful, and Air Force earned another first down. Virginia Tech's defense continued to prevent Air Force from gaining a big play or a touchdown, however, and forced another fourth down. Considering his third fourth-down conversion in the same drive, coach DeBerry instead sent in kicker Joey Ashcroft, who kicked a 21-yard field goal to cut Virginia Tech's lead to 17–13 with 9:50 {{to go in the}} quarter.|$|E
40|$|Holistic {{processing}} <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding {{are widely}} considered primary perceptual mechanisms behind good face recognition. Here, however, we present {{the case of}} S. P., a developmental prosopagnosic who demonstrated severe impairments in <b>face</b> memory <b>and</b> <b>face</b> perception, yet showed normal holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding. Across three composite experiments, S. P. showed normal-strength holistic processing for upright <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> no composite effect for inverted faces. Across five aftereffect experiments, S. P. showed normal-sized face aftereffects, which derived normally from face space rather than shape-generic mechanisms. The case of S. P. implies: (a) normal holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding can be insufficient for good face recognition even when present in combination; and (b) the focus of recent literature on holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space should be expanded to include other potential face processing mechanisms (e. g., part-based processing).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to define a {{standard}} interface for storing and retrieving novel, non-traditional partial differential equation (PDE) discretizations. Although it focuses specifically on finite elements where state is associated with edges <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> of volumetric elements rather than nodes and the elements themselves (as implemented in ALEGRA), the proposed interface should be general enough to accommodate most discretizations, including hp-adaptive finite elements and even mimetic techniques that define fields over arbitrary polyhedra. This report reviews the representation of edge <b>and</b> <b>face</b> elements as implemented by ALEGRA. It then specifies a convention for storing these elements in EXODUS files by extending the EXODUS API to include edge <b>and</b> <b>face</b> blocks in addition to element blocks. Finally, it presents several techniques for rendering edge <b>and</b> <b>face</b> elements using VTK and ParaView, {{including the use of}} VTK's generic dataset interface for interpolating values interior to edges <b>and</b> <b>faces...</b>|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from the}} attack on Ancona, the Austro-Hungarian battleships were {{confined}} to Pola {{for the duration of}} the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff-class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Radetzky and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being. This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, <b>and</b> <b>facing</b> a shortage of coal, Haus attempted to use mines and submarines, rather than battleships, to reduce the numerical superiority of the Allied navies.|$|E

Murray briefly fell back to No. 3 in the world, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in Monte-Carlo, but reclaimed the No. 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the Mutua Madrid Open.
