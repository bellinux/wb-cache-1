Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of and of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat {{and the idea of}} Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
500|$|According to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] {{is about}} [...] "all the rings of {{communication}} around the world. All the rings of pollution, {{and all the}} radioactivity that goes around. If you could visualize <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> don't see, Earth could look {{like some kind of}} fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head– surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." [...] Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the show, the producers had wanted to introduce the concept of LMDs, which Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb noted [...] "have always been part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history in the comics". However, they were unable to before , which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. For the fourth season, they particularly pushed the idea, and Whedon noted that the introduction of Ghost Rider and mysticism allowed the series to introduce new technology that could launch LMDs in a way deemed rewarding, so the Ghost Rider storyline [...] "dovetails" [...] into the LMD storyline. The S.H.I.E.L.D. program is introduced through the character Aida, an android. Additionally, with LMDs chosen as one of the pods for the season, Whedon said the writers questioned, [...] "what are <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> could do? You don't want to do the ones that have been done , and you don't want to leave any on the table." [...] One idea that [...] "we knew we wanted to have early on" [...] was to reveal that the majority of S.H.I.E.L.D. have been replaced at once.|$|E

500|$|Working {{closely with}} Midway Games (which {{developed}} four launch titles for the system) and {{taking advantage of}} the ten months following the Dreamcast's release in Japan, Sega of America worked to ensure a more successful U.S. launch with a minimum of 15 launch games. Despite lingering bitterness over the Saturn's early release, Stolar successfully managed to repair relations with major US retailers, with whom Sega presold 300,000 Dreamcast units. In addition, a pre-launch promotion enabled consumers to rent the system from Hollywood Video in the months preceding its September launch. Sega of America's senior vice president of marketing Peter Moore, a fan of the attitude previously associated with Sega's brand, worked with Foote, Cone & Belding and Access Communications to develop the [...] "It's Thinking" [...] campaign of 15-second television commercials, which emphasized the Dreamcast's hardware power. According to Moore, [...] "We needed to create something that would really intrigue consumers, somewhat apologize for the past, but invoke <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> loved about Sega, primarily from the Genesis days." [...] On August 11, Sega of America confirmed that Stolar had been fired, leaving Moore to direct the launch.|$|E
500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. Which is pretty unrealistic, but it’s what kids can do on the internet now. They can talk to somebody anywhere".|$|E

2500|$|During his January 1989 {{visit to}} Shevardnadze Najibullah wanted {{to retain a}} small {{presence}} of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and called for moving Soviet bombers to military bases close to the Afghan–Soviet border and place them on permanent alert. Najibullah also repeated his claims that his government could not survive if Massoud remained alive. Shevardnadze again repeated that troops could not stay, since {{it would lead to}} international outcry, but said he would look into the matter. Shevardnadze demanded that the Soviet embassy created a plan in which at least 12,000 Soviet troops would remain in Afghanistan either under direct control of the United Nations or remain as [...] "volunteers". The Soviet military leadership, when hearing of Shevardnadze's plan, became furious. But they followed orders, and named the operation Typhoon, maybe ironic considering that Operation Typhoon was the German military operation against the city of Moscow during World War II. Shevardnadze contacted the Soviet leadership about moving a unit to break the siege of Kandahar, and to protect convoys from and to the city. The Soviet leadership were against Shevardnadze's plan, and Chernyaev even believed it was part of Najibullah's plan to keep Soviet troops in the country. To which Shevardnadze replied angrily [...] "You've not been there, [...] You've no idea <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> have done there in the past ten years." [...] At a Politburo meeting on 24 January, Shevardnadze argued that the Soviet leadership could be indifferent to Najibullah and his government; again, Shevardnadze received support from Kryuchkov. In the end Shevardnadze lost the debate, and the Politburo reaffirmed their commitment to withdraw from Afghanistan. There was still a small presence of Soviet troops after the Soviet withdrawal; for instance, parachutists who protected the Soviet embassy staff, military advisors and special forces and reconnaissance troops still operated in the [...] "outlying provinces", especially along the Afghan–Soviet border.|$|E

Gerard of Bideford, the fanatic who was Grand Master of the Templars, forced the king's hand against the advice of the wiser soldier, who had pointed out the peril of perishing of thirst in the waterless wastes between them and the enemy. Into those wastes they advanced, and they were already weary and unfit for warfare by the time they came in sight of the strange hills that will be remembered for ever under the name of the Horns of Hattin. On those hills, a few hours later, the last knights of an army of which half had fallen gathered in a final defiance and despair round the relic they carried in their midst, a fragment of the True Cross. In that hour fell, as I have fancied, more hopes than they themselves could number, and the glory departed from the Middle Ages. There fell with them all that New Jerusalem which was the symbol of a new world, all those great and growing promises and possibilities of Christendom of which this vision was the centre, all that [...] "justice for the bourgeois and the peasant, and for the trading communes," [...] all the guilds that gained their charters by fighting for the Cross, all the hopes of a happier transformation of the Roman Law wedded to charity and to chivalry.
