2500|$|Hilja Riipinen's anti-communism was {{sparked by}} the Finnish Civil War. It turned into {{relentless}} hostility against socialism <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> reminding of the [...] "bloody Marxist revolution enthusiasm in 1918" [...] in her speeches for years. Her views {{have been described as}} one having {{to take part in a}} conflict between Marxist and non-Marxist world views, of which only one can win. She also felt that this was a flaw in the political system: democracy could only lead to bad compromises. Being fond of [...] "high spirituality", she opposed Marxist materialism and will to dispose traditional morality and modesty. Riipinen thought that socialism poisoned people's relationship to work by claiming that work is slavery. Her radical views were widely noted in left-wing circles who considered her one of the worst agitators. Socialist newspapers wrote about [...] "Amazon Hilja Riipinen" [...] and referred to the [...] "white fists of Hilja Riipinen".|$|E
2500|$|In October 1997, {{attorney}} Vernon Petria filed {{a lawsuit}} against First Baptist Church of Hammond, accusing the church and its pastor of allowing a mentally retarded woman to be sexually assaulted for six years. The civil suit filed in Lake Superior Court in Gary claims the woman was [...] "induced by agents" [...] of the church in 1991 to ride a bus to attend Sunday school at First Baptist and {{when she was in the}} care of the church she was sexually assaulted, molested, battered and raped more than once until 1996. Hyles was sued because he and his church [...] "failed in their duty to protect her," [...] Petri said. The lawsuit alleged this was a pattern of assault can be traced to a Sunday in 1991, when a First Baptist teacher saw someone abusing the woman and reported it to church leaders and police, but the parents were never told <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> going to church, where she was threatened into silence. The sexual abuse ended when the woman [...] "developed a horrible infection and was taken to a doctor to find out what was wrong," [...] Petri said. [...] "When the doctor couldn't understand where the infection was coming from, she was admitted to a hospital where they found, embedded in her, a plastic object." [...] The woman then told what happened, Petri said, recalling that a church program instructor led her to a room and served as a lookout while two to three males raped her.|$|E

2500|$|The Kewpie doll {{has been}} the mascot of the school for the last 100 years. Hickman is the only known school {{in the world with}} a Kewpie as its mascot. The name dates back to the {{basketball}} season of 1913 -1914 at what was known then as Columbia High School. Apparently, the school secretary owned a Kewpie doll, as they were popular figurines then, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> it on her desk. [...] At one of the first basketball games in December 1913 she placed her Kewpie doll {{in the center of the}} court, and the entire game was played around it without it being broken. [...] This was somewhat remarkable since the dolls were very fragile. [...] Because it survived the game and brought a victory, it was thereafter considered the good luck mascot. [...] You can see a picture of that Kewpie doll beneath Sam Church in the team photograph in the 1914 school annual. That team had a straight claim to the state championship of Missouri for 1914 as they had an undefeated season. Coincidentally Sam Church was the Captain of the 1914 Kewpie basketball team and was the first Kewpie to letter in four sports. The school annual, the Cresset of 1914 was the first annual to display a Kewpie. In addition to the doll between Sam’s feet in the team picture a drawing of a Kewpie appeared as a dedication to the team. The dedication said, “To the Basket Ball Team of 1914, whose loyalty to the school and to the Kewpie motto, ‘Keep Smiling’, has won the State Championship, this volume of the Cresset is dedicated.” The only previous known mascot for Columbia High School, which became David Henry Hickman High School in 1927, was the Trojans. [...] It is referenced in the first school annual, the Cresset of 1912. Columbia/Hickman High School has graduated over 35,000 “Kewpies” in its history and they are still proud to be called “Kewpies!” ...|$|E
