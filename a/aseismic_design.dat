The optimum dynamic characteristics are determined soas to minimize the performance index and to limit non-dimensional displacement or ductilityfactor within the allowable value. Spectral densities {{and standard deviations of}} three-degree-of-freedom system to white noise excitation are calculated to examine the validity of the above-mentioned method.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that local geological conditions {{have a large}} impact on ground motion at a given site. The geometry of the subsoil structure, the variation of soil types and its properties with depth, the lateral discontinuities and the surface topography are at the origin of large amplification of ground motion and have been correlated to damage distribution during destructive earthquakes (Aki, 1993; Bard, 1994; Faccioli, 1991; 1996; Chavez-Garcia et al., 1996; Pitilakis et al., 1999, 2001 a, 2001 b). Site effects estimation requires an adequate knowledge of the geometry and the dynamic properties of soil formations. Among the dynamic properties of soil deposits, the shear waves velocity (Vs) that defines the shear modulus (Go), {{is one of the}} most important parameter that controls the amplification of seismic motion. The knowledge of the dynamic properties, especially Vs velocity, and geometrical characteristics of soil formations allow the study of ground response and hence the assessment of the basic parameters for the <b>aseismic</b> <b>designs</b> of structures. Different aspects of site amplification from experimental and theoretical point of view were extensively discussed during all recent conferences such as 11 th WCEE - Acapulco (1996), 11 th ECEE - Paris (1998), ESG 98 - Yokohama (1998) and 12 th WCEE - New Zealand (2000). Issues like effects of irregular geological configurations, near field phenomena, basin edge and 2 D effects are better understood and quantified as well. However, this kind of studies requires the ‘design’ of 2 D sections that describe the geometrical and dynamic characteristics of soil formations independently of the depth of the rock basement. These aspects constitute the basic motives of the present thesis. The aim is to determine the geometrical and dynamic characteristics of soil formations, down to the rock basement, at Thessaloniki city, a densely populated and urbanized area. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the dynamic {{response}} of a structure to an earthquake has been formulated in a manner which permits separation {{of the characteristics of}} particular structures from the characteristics of the earthquake. The expression involving the characteristics of the earthquake is defined as the "spectrum" of the earthquake and it is shown that the spectrum is simply a plot of the response of a simple oscillator versus the period of the oscillator. Eighty-eight such spectra were computed by means of an electric analog computer and are presented in this report. It is found that damping is a very important parameter in the overall problem; relatively small amounts of damping reduce structural response sharply. It is shown that, when damping is considered, the spectra are consistent with the hypothesis of a distribution about a mean value. It is concluded that the concept of a "dominant ground period" is not valid for the purpose of <b>aseismic</b> structural <b>design.</b> Further research on damping in buildings is recommended, and it is proposed that the mean value of a damped spectrum be used as a quantitative measure of earthquake intensity...|$|R
40|$|An {{earthquake}} suddenly {{releases a}} large to extremely {{large amount of}} kinetic energy in the Earth's crust and on ground surface within a few to two hundreds seconds, and generates seismic waves in rock crust {{and on the ground}} surface. So far, people have recognized and used only two types of seismic/earthquake loadings to buildings and structures. One is the co-seismic surface rupture {{as an extension of the}} active geological fault causing the earthquake. The other is the seismic wave generated by the faulting. This paper presents an unknown type of disastrous earthquake loadings that has been discovered by the author. It has not been recognized and used and prevented in <b>aseismic</b> analysis and <b>design</b> of structures around world. It is the loading of highly pressurized natural gas mass rapidly flowing from deep fault rocks to shallow ground and foundations of structures (Figure 1). The rapid expansion and migration of the highly compressed gas release the earthquake energy that suddenly released in the Earth's crust within a few seconds to a few tens seconds over a large area. The paper uses the many phenomena that have been observed before, during and after the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake to demonstrate this unknown type of disastrous earthquake loadings. Because of this gas loading, an earth quaking is NOT a heating up process BUT a cooling down process in faulted rocks and soils and atmosphere at the epicenter area. ([URL]...|$|R

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient harmonic wavelet-based {{iterative procedure}} is proposed to modify suites of recorded accelerograms {{to be used}} in the <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> of critical structures regulated by the European code provisions (EC 8). Special attention is focused on assessing the potential of appropriately defined orthogonal harmonic wavelet basis functions to derive design spectrum compatible time-histories which preserve the non-stationary characteristics of the original recorded signals. This is a quite desirable attribute in the practice of the <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> of yielding structures. In this regard, seven recorded accelerograms recommended for the design of base-isolated structures are modified via the proposed procedure and base-line adjusted to meet the pertinent EC 8 compatibility criteria. The instantaneous energy (IE) and the mean instantaneous frequency (MIF) of the modified EC 8 compatible time-histories extracted from appropriate wavelet-based signal time-frequency analyses are compared vis-à-vis the IE and MIF of the corresponding original accelerograms. Examining these numerical results, it is established that the herein proposed procedure is a useful tool for processing recorded accelerograms in cases where accounting for the time-varying energy content and frequency composition of strong ground motions associated with historic seismic events is deemed essential in <b>aseismic</b> <b>design...</b>|$|E
40|$|While site {{effects are}} {{accounted}} for in most modern U. S. seismic design codes for building structures, there exist no standardized procedures for the computationally efficient integration of nonlinear ground response analyses in broadband ground motion simulations. In turn, {{the lack of a}} unified methodology affects the prediction accuracy of site-specific ground motion intensity measures, the evaluation of site amplification factors when broadband simulations are used for the development of hybrid attenuation relations and the estimation of inelastic structural performance when strong motion records are used as input in <b>aseismic</b> structural <b>design</b> procedures. In this study, a set of criteria is established, which quantifies how strong nonlinear effects are anticipated to manifest at a site by investigating the empirical relation between nonlinear soil response, soil properties, and ground motion characteristics. More specifically, the modeling variability and parametric uncertainty of nonlinear soil response predictions are studied, along with the uncertainty propagation of site response analyses to the estimation of inelastic structural performance. Due to the scarcity of design level ground motion recording, the geotechnical information at 24 downhole arrays is used and the profiles are subjected to broadband ground motion synthetics. For the modeling variability study, the site response models are validated against available downhole array observations. The site and ground motion parameters that govern the intensity of nonlinear effects are next identified, and an empirical relationship is established, which may be used to estimate to a first approximation the error introduced in ground motion predictions if nonlinear effects are not accounted for. The soil parameter uncertainty in site response predictions is next evaluated {{as a function of the}} same measures of soil properties and ground motion characteristics. It is shown that the effects of nonlinear soil property uncertainties on the ground-motion variability strongly depend on the seismic motion intensity, and this dependency is more pronounced for soft soil profiles. By contrast, the effects of velocity profile uncertainties are less intensity dependent and more sensitive to the velocity impedance in the near surface that governs the maximum site amplification. Finally, a series of bilinear single degree of freedom oscillators are subjected to the synthetic ground motions computed using the alternative soil models, and evaluate the consequent variability in structural response. Results show high bias and uncertainty of the inelastic structural displacement ratio predicted using the linear site response model for periods close to the fundamental period of the soil profile. The amount of bias and the period range where the structural performance uncertainty manifests are shown to be a function of both input motion and site parameters. Ph. D.

40|$|Foreword to the English {{translation}} The 1908 Messina (Italy) earthquake triggered intense activity among seismologists {{and engineers}} who started to seriously consider seismically resistant construction (see, for instance the paper by Sorentino, 2007). Andrija Mohorovičić was no exception. At {{the time he}} was a director of the Meteorological Observatory in Zagreb, but all of his scientific interests were already directed towards seismology (more on his life and work may be found in e. g. Skoko and Mokrovi}, 1982, 1998, or Herak and Herak, 2007). Although he was mostly interested in physical aspects of earthquakes and wave propagation (his greatest scientific accomplishment – proof of the existence of the crust-mantle boundary – is less than two years away), Mohorovičić was always deeply concerned with the engineering aspect of the problem. For instance, in his overview paper on the developments in seismology (Mohorovičić, 1913), he wrote: »… Systematic study of earthquakes has also one very practical aspect. Strong earthquakes often cause great damage to houses and other buildings, and occasionally they level to the ground large and rich cities, and bury thousands of people under the ruins. Therefore, one of the most important goals of seismology is to theoretically study how the movement of the earth affects buildings, and to apply these results as well as the experience gained in catastrophic earthquakes to show the ways of constructing buildings resistant as much as possible against earthquakes. …« This topic was apparently a matter of great importance for him. On March 1, 1909, he held a lecture at the Croatian Society of Engineers and Architects (CSEA), in which he attempted to explain how the earth shakes during earthquakes, and what are the effects of this shaking on buildings. Later that year, in the newspaper article dedicated mostly to the effects of the Kupa valley earthquake of October 8 (the analyses of which led him to his epochal discovery), he describes damage to houses and other buildings, and adds: »… I take this opportunity to warn all responsible institutions of outdated building codes, which completely disregard the ways earthquakes affect buildings. In March of this year I have delivered a lecture on that subject in the Society of Engineers and Architects in Zagreb, and I stressed the need to consider earthquakes when buildings are constructed. I will soon publish the extended edition of the lecture. So far, my appeals fell on deaf ears; after the lecture, many buildings were erected in Zagreb that pose threat for passers-by, as well as to themselves. …« (Mohorovičić, 1909 a). Although – as he puts it – his was the voice of a man lost in the desert, there has been some response from authorities. The archives of the Department of Geophysics hold a letter (filed on April 18, 1910) from the Royal Department of Religion and Education in which he is asked to provide advice on how to construct schools, churches and parish houses to better resist earthquakes. Mohorovičić responded the same day, eagerly agreeing to act as consultant. He informed the Department that he has already finished the manuscript describing his studies (based on the above mentioned lecture), and urges the government to persuade the Department of Civil Engineering to cover the cost of publication. The letter ends with: »… The book would be useful not only to the Royal Department of Civil Engineering, but also to the architects and entrepreneurs. It would promote improvement of the construction process, and would certainly stimulate many experts to keep considering this subject, and to use experience to perfect what the undersigned has started. « On May 5, 1910 Mohorovičić despatched a 23 -page document addressed to the Division of Internal Affairs and its Department of Civil Engineering, in which he put forward a remarkably detailed plan of actions leading to improvement of the building and construction in order to secure seismic resistance of edifices. As far as we know, the Government did not react at all… The extended version of the lecture of 1909 was eventually published in 1911 in 9 sequels in the News of the CSEA (Mohorovičić, 1911 a), and was reprinted in a booklet later in the same year (Mohorovičić, 1911 b). This study, regarded by the Croatian scientific community to be the origin of engineering seismology in Croatia, is unknown to non-Croatian speaking professionals. On the centennial of the lecture, the Editorial board of Geofizika decided to publish its translation into English, thus providing the international seismological and civil engineering community an insight into this, generally unrecognized, aspect of Mohorovičić’s professional activity. The study itself is typical of most of the Mohorovičić’s opus – it is a thorough, multifaceted insight into the problem of <b>aseismic</b> building <b>design,</b> with special emphasis to building types most frequently found in Croatia of that time. Being a transcript of articles from a non-scientific publication, only one formal reference – Baratta (1910) – is found of previous work done by foreign researchers. Nevertheless, Mohorovičić refers to unspecified Omori’s papers and other Japanese investigations in several places. That he was in large part inspired by the work of Japanese and British seismologists working in Japan, is also clear from another lecture he gave in the CSEA (Mohorovičić, 1909 b) about the Japanese studies on earthquake resistant buildings, citing works by Omori (1901) and Kikuchi (1904). The study has an Introduction where Mohorovičić presents his motivation, but also introduces concepts of seismic hazard and earthquake risk in such a way that 100 years later, there is little one could add or improve. He deals with inhomogeneous distribution of seismicity, distinguishes between buildings according to their purpose and expected life-span, and even gives financial and economical motivation for building earthquake resistant houses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time anyone (in Croatia) attempted to use earthquake statistics to estimate cumulative effects a building will have to withstand during its lifetime. Here he also warns against the practice of considering only static loads, completely disregarding external excitation (except, occasionally, the wind). The Introduction is followed by paragraphs in which Mohorovičić presents basic physics of the shaking of the ground during earthquakes. He clearly identifies resonance of the buildings and earthquake waves as the primary threat to structures, and goes on to describe eigen- and forced vibrations of buildings. In the main body of the paper Mohorovičić analyses most common building elements and building types and their resistance and response to earthquake shaking. His excellent physical background helped him to deal not only with the simplest structures (like columns), but also with rather complicated buildings types. The calculations enabled him to draw a number of rules to be observed in order to build earthquake-resistant buildings, which are presented in the concluding paragraph. One century later, the 15 Mohorovičić’s rules are still valid and applicable, which is easy to confirm if one compares them with the basic principles of conceptual design as listed in Eurocode- 8 (2004).

WilsonCurrent codes of practice {{for the design of}} tall concrete chimneys provide conservative <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> guidelines in high seismic regions. A lack of experimental data related to the cyclic behaviour of chimney structures to severe earthquake excitation has resulted in the assumption that such structures are brittle and must be designed in the elastic range. This design approach results in expensive structures and is not consistent with the design philosophy commonly adopted for general structure which permits some inelastic response at the ultimate limit state event. A research program funded by the CICIND organisation has been undertaken to investigate the inelastic cyclic behaviour of tall reinforce concrete chimneys using both experimental and analytical techniques to determine whether the behaviour is brittle or ductile.

The inelastic load-deformation behaviour of the structural members and vibration of the foundations on the flexible soil medium are two important features of the energy dissipation. Soil-structure interaction is the way to refine the existing common methods in structural analysis as it able {{to take into account the}} soil-foundation energy dissipation from the structural system. Study of the response of building structures supported by a soil medium using lumped parameter methods have been carried out by some researchers. However, most of these studies used unrealistic physical or structural responses and soil-foundation models which did not have real application in modern building <b>aseismic</b> <b>design.</b> The current New Zealand code NZS 4203 : 1992 states that a special study should be carried out where energy dissipation in the structural system is primarily through the rocking of foundations. Analytical investigations using the same methods in more realistic applications of <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> in building structures was carried out. The investigations cover several inelastic damage indicators for both frames and frame-wall structures with a different numbers of storeys, numbers of frames, hysteresis rules, rigid joint lengths, supported by different foundation types, soil models, soil stiffnesses and exited by different earthquake inputs. It was found that rocking structures exhibit advantages or disadvantages and show the inadequacy of the current wall moment design envelopes for frame-wall structures. Methods to overcome the disadvantages need to be developed. A new simple wall moment design envelope for different types of foundation and soil-foundation hysteresis rules has been proposed.

The adequacy of the 'zone factor' in the <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> code is discussed by the estimated maximum accerelation on ground surface after Kanai's formula.

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach {{for addressing the}} problem of synthesizing artificial seismic accelerograms compatible with a given displacement design/target spectrum is presented in conjunction with <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> applications. Initially, a stochastic dynamics solution is used to obtain a family of simulated non-stationary earthquake records whose response spectrum is on the average in good agreement with the target spectrum. The degree of the agreement depends significantly on the adoption of an appropriate parametric evolutionary power spectral form, which {{is related to the}} target spectrum in an approximate manner. The performance of two commonly used spectral forms along with a newly proposed one is assessed with respect to the elastic displacement design spectrum defined by the European code regulations (EC 8). Subsequently, the computational versatility of the family of harmonic wavelets is employed to modify iteratively the simulated records to satisfy the compatibility criteria for artificial accelerograms prescribed by EC 8. In the process, baseline correction steps, ordinarily taken to ensure that the obtained accelerograms are characterized by physically meaningful velocity and displacement traces, are elucidated. Obviously, the presented approach can be used not only {{in the case of the}} EC 8, for which extensive numerical results/examples are included, but also for any code provisions mandated by regulatory agencies. In any case, the presented numerical results can be quite useful in any <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> process dominated by the EC 8 specifications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} welded perforated beam-to-column connections, forming the so-called RWS systems. The effect of using non-standard novel web opening configurations of variable depths and positions is investigated. The ease of manufacturing process together with the improvements on the structural behaviour foreshadows the enhancements gained using these perforated members. It is concluded that using large perforations is an effective way of improving the behaviour of connections enhancing their ductility and their energy dissipation capacity. The connections with novel openings outperform the conventional ones; hence they can be suitably used in the <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> of steel frames...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the effects o£ local soil {{conditions}} on strong ground motion {{is of particular interest}} now because of efforts underway to modify the building codes, new legislation concerning the <b>aseismic</b> <b>design</b> of hospitals, problems of earthquake-resistant design of nuclear power plants and a generally increasing sophistication of earthquake-resistant design procedures in structural engineering practice. As a result of these factors, many major projects now require geological and seismological studies, including some assessment of the expected earthquake motion at the site and an estimate of any probable effects of local site conditions on the expected motions...|$|E
