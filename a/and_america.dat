5|$|The book {{influenced}} {{households in}} Britain <b>and</b> <b>America</b> {{to aspire to}} more complex, French-style dinners in imitation of the Queen, and resulted in a change in eating habits, including the modern two-course approach for both lunch and dinner.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Hartman studied art at Santa Monica City College, {{dropping}} out in 1969 {{to become a}} roadie with a rock band. He returned to school in 1972, this time studying graphic arts at California State University, Northridge. He developed his own graphic arts business, which he operated on his own, creating over 40 album covers for bands including Poco <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> as well as advertising and the logo for Crosby, Stills & Nash. In the late 1970s, Hartman made his first television appearance on an episode of The Dating Game; he won but was stood up by his date.|$|E

5|$|All the {{characters}} featured in Alan Wake {{were based on}} real life models. Ilkka Villi and Jonna Järvenpää, the models for Alan and Alice Wake, respectively, are the only Finnish models in the game; all other models were American. Voice overs were provided by native actors from Japan <b>and</b> <b>America</b> for their respective regions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain <b>and</b> <b>America</b> were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> {{the film has}} sometimes been seen as drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for the upper class. It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E

5|$|Claiming that {{publishers}} {{would no}} longer accept anti-interventionist books, Townsend began self-publishing pamphlets. Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which were extremely popular and widely circulated among anti-interventionists. Two of them, The High Cost of Hate <b>and</b> <b>America</b> Has No Enemies In Asia, had a circulation of at least 60,000 copies, while another, There Is No Halfway Neutrality printed 30,000 copies. The last pamphlet in the series, Seeking Foreign Trouble, {{attracted the attention of}} the German embassy in Washington DC which bought and distributed more than 500 copies of it.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its name}} it was {{intended}} for merchants of all types, and a number {{directly involved in the}} Guinea and West Indian slave trade used it for business transactions. Inside the Corn Exchange the plasterwork in the main hall represents the four corners of the world, including Africa <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> the latter wearing a headdress of tobacco leaves. On the outside of the building are carvings of African, American, Asian and European figures and animals, again symbols of Bristol's foreign trade including the Bristol slave trade.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{sold over}} 2.65 {{million copies in}} Japan {{by the end of}} 2000, making it the second-highest selling game of the year there.

As of March 31, 2003, the game had sold 5.30million copies worldwide. The game was voted the 24th-best game of all time by readers of the Japanese {{magazine}} Famitsu.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|His {{practice}} of dividing {{his time between}} Britain <b>and</b> <b>America</b> caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident. After lengthy negotiations the matter was settled, but the Wodehouses decided to change their residential status beyond doubt by moving to France, where they bought a house near Le Touquet in northern France.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived {{version of}} the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main {{differences}} with the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain <b>and</b> <b>America.</b> The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl {{at the time of}} the music's original American release.|$|E

5|$|In January 1985, {{production}} of Ran was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned {{to finish his}} film and Ran premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on 31 May, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, {{as he had done}} with Kagemusha, Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to composing, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano Denise Duval, touring in Europe <b>and</b> <b>America</b> with each, and making many recordings. He {{was among the}} first composers to see the importance of the gramophone, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain <b>and</b> <b>America.</b> Performances of {{the work}} have become more ever common, with {{innovative}} stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made {{it one of the}} most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival.|$|E
