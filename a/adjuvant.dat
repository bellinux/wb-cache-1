In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, <b>adjuvant</b> chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. <b>Adjuvant</b> chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit.

5|$|<b>Adjuvant</b> {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). <b>Adjuvant</b> chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adjuvant</b> {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of <b>adjuvant</b> radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Recurrence {{of early}} stage endometrial cancer ranges from 3 to 17%, {{depending}} on primary and <b>adjuvant</b> treatment. Most recurrences (75–80%) occur {{outside of the}} pelvis, and most occur {{two to three years}} after treatment, 64% after two years and 87% after three years.|$|E
40|$|A central goal in {{vaccinology}} is {{the induction}} {{of high and}} sustained Ab responses. Protein-in-adjuvant formulations are commonly used to achieve such responses. However, their clinical development can be limited by the reactogenicity {{of some of the}} most potent preclinical <b>adjuvants</b> and the cost and complexity of licensing new <b>adjuvants</b> for human use. Also, few <b>adjuvants</b> induce strong cellular immunity, which is important for protection against many diseases, such as malaria. We compared classical <b>adjuvants</b> such as aluminum hydroxide to new preclinical <b>adjuvants</b> and <b>adjuvants</b> in clinical development, such as Abisco 100, CoVaccine HT, Montanide ISA 720, and stable emulsion-glucopyranosyl lipid A, for their ability to induce high and sustained Ab responses and T cell responses. These <b>adjuvants</b> induced a broad range of Ab responses when used in a three-shot protein-in-adjuvant regimen using the model Ag OVA and leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate Ags. Surprisingly, this range of Ab immunogenicity was greatly reduced when a protein-in-adjuvant vaccine was used to boost Ab responses primed by a human adenovirus serotype 5 vaccine recombinant for the same Ag. This human adenovirus serotype 5 -protein regimen also induced a more cytophilic Ab response and demonstrated improved efficacy of merozoite surface protein- 1 protein vaccines against a Plasmodium yoelii blood-stage challenge. This indicates that the differential immunogenicity of protein vaccine <b>adjuvants</b> may be largely overcome by prior immunization with recombinant adenovirus, especially for <b>adjuvants</b> that are traditionally considered poorly immunogenic in the context of subunit vaccination and may circumvent the need for more potent chemical <b>adjuvants...</b>|$|R

5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan.

30|$|Vaccination is an {{effective}} strategy to prevent infectious or immune related diseases, which has made remarkable contribution in human history. Recently increasing attentions have been paid to mucosal vaccination due to its multiple advantages over conventional ways. Subunit or peptide antigens are more reasonable immunogens for mucosal vaccination than live or attenuated pathogens, however <b>adjuvants</b> are required to augment the immune responses. Many mucosal <b>adjuvants</b> {{have been developed to}} prime desirable immune responses to different etiologies. Compared with pathogen derived <b>adjuvants,</b> innate endogenous molecules incorporated into mucosal vaccines demonstrate prominent adjuvanticity and safety. Nowadays, cytokines are broadly used as mucosal <b>adjuvants</b> for participation of signal transduction of immune responses, activation of innate immunity and polarization of adaptive immunity. Desired immune responses are promptly and efficaciously primed on basis of specific interactions between cytokines and corresponding receptors. In addition, some other innate molecules are also identified as potent mucosal <b>adjuvants.</b> This review focuses on innate endogenous mucosal <b>adjuvants,</b> hoping to shed light on the development of mucosal vaccines.|$|R
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of action of human <b>adjuvants</b> could inform a rational development of next generation vaccines for human use. Here, we exploited a genome wide transcriptomics analysis combined with a systems biology approach to determine the molecular signatures induced by four clinically tested vaccine <b>adjuvants,</b> namely CAF 01, IC 31, GLA-SE and Alum in mice. We report signature molecules, pathways, gene modules and networks, which are shared by or otherwise exclusive to these clinical-grade <b>adjuvants</b> in whole blood and draining lymph nodes of mice. Intriguingly, co-expression analysis revealed blood gene modules highly enriched for molecules with documented roles in T follicular helper (TFH) and germinal center (GC) responses. We could show that all <b>adjuvants</b> enhanced, although with different magnitude and kinetics, TFH and GC B cell responses in draining lymph nodes. These results represent, to our knowledge, the first comparative systems analysis of clinically tested vaccine <b>adjuvants</b> that may provide new insights into the mechanisms of action of human <b>adjuvants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Autumn leaf scars are an {{important}} pathogen infection site for European canker on apples. Trials were undertaken to evaluate the effects of <b>adjuvants</b> on spray coverage of new leaf scars, and determine if <b>adjuvants</b> could (1) impart any significant rainfastness to protectant captan sprays and (2) provide any redistribution of captan during a rain event post-leaf drop. Retention on fresh leaf scars was increased {{with the use of}} organosilicone-latex sticker <b>adjuvants</b> only. Rain had little effect on spray residues but these <b>adjuvants</b> could improve rainfastness of captan due to their effects on spray retention. Retention on stem wood and around leaf nodes was increased by up to seven-fold with the use of superspreader-type <b>adjuvants,</b> due to redistribution of spray runoff from leaves. High initial deposits resulted in post-rain residues on leaf scars three-fold higher than a captan spray alone. Redistribution of captan onto exposed leaf scars in rain appears likely with these <b>adjuvants...</b>|$|R

Similarly, the landmark trials of Bernard Fisher, chair of the National Surgical <b>Adjuvant</b> Breast and Bowel Project, and of Gianni Bonadonna, working in the Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano, Italy, proved that <b>adjuvant</b> chemotherapy after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival — particularly in more advanced cancer.|$|E

40|$|Modern <b>adjuvants</b> should induce {{strong and}} {{balanced}} immune responses, {{and it is}} often desirable to induce specific types of immunity.

40|$|Vaccine {{efficacy}} is optimized by {{addition of}} immune <b>adjuvants.</b> However, although <b>adjuvants</b> {{have been used}} for over a century, to date, only few <b>adjuvants</b> are approved for human use, mostly aimed at improving vaccine efficacy and antigen-specific protective antibody production. The mechanism of action of immune <b>adjuvants</b> is diverse, depending on their chemical and molecular nature, ranging from non-specific effects (i. e., antigen depot at the immunization site) to specific activation of immune cells leading to improved host innate and adaptive responses. Although the detailed molecular mechanism of action of many <b>adjuvants</b> is still elusive, the discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has provided new critical information on immunostimulatory effect of numerous bacterial components that engage TLRs. These ligands have been shown to improve both the quality and the quantity of host adaptive immune responses when used in vaccine formulations targeted to infectious diseases and cancer that require both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The potential of such TLR <b>adjuvants</b> in improving the design and the outcomes of several vaccines is continuously evolving, as new agonists are discovered and tested in experimental and clinical models of vaccination. In this review, a summary of the recent progress in development of TLR <b>adjuvants</b> is presented...|$|R

25|$|Since {{testicular}} cancers can spread, {{patients are}} usually offered <b>adjuvant</b> treatment - {{in the form}} of chemotherapy or radiotherapy - to kill any cancerous cells that may exist outside of the affected testicle. The type of <b>adjuvant</b> therapy depends largely on the histology of the tumor (i.e. {{the size and shape of}} its cells under the microscope) and the stage of progression at the time of surgery (i.e. how far cells have 'escaped' from the testicle, invaded the surrounding tissue, or spread to the rest of the body). If the cancer is not particularly advanced, patients may be offered careful surveillance by periodic CT scans and blood tests, in place of <b>adjuvant</b> treatment.|$|E

40|$|Vaccine <b>adjuvants</b> are {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in enhancing the immunogenicity of existing and new-generation vaccines against infectious diseases. In particular, <b>adjuvants</b> should direct the immune response in the most appropriate manner-furthering, for example, an expanded B-cell response, a cytotoxic T-cell response, or aT-helper 1 or 2 subset response. While some noncytokine <b>adjuvants</b> have exerted potent effects, their modes of action are most likely mediated by cytokines. Several cytokines have already been shown to be efficient <b>adjuvants</b> in animal models and/or in clinical trials.

40|$|<b>Adjuvants</b> enhance {{immunity}} to vaccines and experimental antigens {{by a variety}} of mechanisms.
