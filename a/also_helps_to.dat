5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|After {{the family}} obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a funeral {{director}} (also {{known as an}} undertaker) who collects the body, embalms it if necessary, and delivers it to the wake. In addition, they {{have to decide whether}} the body is to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The funeral director <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E
25|$|Out-of-group {{achievement}} testing (such {{as taking}} the SAT or ACT early) can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> identify these students early on (see SMPY) and is implemented by various talent search programs in use by education programs. Out-of-group testing can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> differentiate {{children who have}} scored in the highest percentiles in a single IQ test.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Odine is a {{scientist}} and magic researcher from Esthar. He discovered the GFs and junctioning and engineered {{a machine that}} mimics Ellone's power. Seventeen years before the game, he developed the necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from reaching Tears' Point and initiating a Lunar Cry. Odine also {{plays a role in}} the plot to destroy Ultimecia, explaining how to survive time compression.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings {{than there are}} chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available {{after the first few}} moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later. Development <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E

25|$|Since the 2000s {{cosmetic}} compositions containing taurine {{have been}} introduced, possibly {{due to its}} antifibrotic properties. It {{has been shown to}} prevent the damaging effects of TGFB1 to hair follicles. It <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> maintain skin hydration.|$|E

25|$|Toki {{takes up}} a job selling condoms door-to-door, but she gets too {{involved}} in the personal matters of her clients and isn't very successful.

25|$|Furthermore, a viaduct (the Rieucros Viaduct) {{commissioned}} in December 2009 {{will be used}} {{to ensure}} a first bypass of Mende. It connects the industrial area of the Causse d'Auge to the technological centre of Valcroze (and the RD 42) and <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> relieve the traffic connecting the districts north and northwest of the city.|$|E
25|$|Athena {{additionally}} wears a helmet, which <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> {{date the}} statue. This is because Athena wears a Corinthian helmet, which in fourth century B.C became very popular, {{as opposed to}} an Attic helmet where she is shown wearing in other sculptures. The helmet in the Piraeus Athena has griffins {{on each side of the}} crest, and two owls on the visor.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} a {{periphery}} country to industrialize, it must first undergo proto-industrialization. In this stage, a market-based economy begins to form, normally in rural areas, using agricultural products. Proto-industrialization <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> organize the rural market in these country and allows for them to become more capitalistic. Finally, once these countries develop this style of economy, they can begin to build factories and machines.|$|E
25|$|The camp {{itself is}} built on a {{relatively}} secluded area in Mount Vernon, taking over facilities previously occupied by the reserve units. Comprehensive facilities to create a self-contained township-like complex allows most daily chores {{and needs to be}} fulfilled within the camp without too much interaction with the outside world. This <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> reduce the amount of traffic {{into and out of the}} camp for security reasons.|$|E
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|E

25|$|Maturing {{can also}} be done in barrels. The wine is put in barrels after {{fermentation}} but fermentation itself may also occur in the barrel. The barrel has a dual role: it flavours the wine giving it a scent of toast, butter, and vanilla but it <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> mature it by providing a very small regular quantity of oxygen through the wooden walls. This oxygen helps to polymerize {{the components of the}} wine making it less aggressive and more balanced.|$|E
25|$|Sexual and caste {{dimorphism}} is very {{pronounced in}} this species. While all individuals have a distinctive marking on their scuta, workers, males, and queens all have different appearances. Workers and males have similar black and yellow striped patterning, but the queen has fewer black markings {{and a more}} orange/brown coloring. Wing length <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> differentiate between the worker and male. Workers have fore wing lengths of 9.5-11.0mm, and males’ are about 12.5mm. In addition, the queen is about 4mm longer than her worker and male counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Acro dancers {{commonly}} wear flexible, form-fitting {{clothing for}} both safety and aesthetic reasons. Form-fitting clothing is preferred over loose clothing because the latter {{does not move}} synchronously with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control. This is especially important when a dancer is performing tricks, as loss of control can lead to serious injury. Aside from the safety aspect, form-fitting clothing <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> expose a dancer's body lines, which can add significantly to the visual impact of an acro dance performance.|$|E
