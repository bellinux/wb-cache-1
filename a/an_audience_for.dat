5|$|On 24 June, Radiohead {{played a}} {{surprise}} {{performance on the}} Park stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, performing songs from The King of Limbs before <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> the first time. In September, they played two dates at New York City's Roseland Ballroom and made American TV appearances including a one-hour special episode of The Colbert Report and the season première of Saturday Night Live. In February 2012, they began their first extended North American tour in four years, including dates in the United States, Canada and Mexico. While on tour, Radiohead spent a day working on new material at Jack White's Third Man Records studio, but discarded the recordings.|$|E
5|$|Josef von Sternberg was {{directing}} in Hollywood at {{the same}} time. Films of his such as Shanghai Express (1932) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent Underworld (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932) demonstrated that there was <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered films noir, perhaps none had a greater effect {{on the development of}} the genre than Citizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic films noir.|$|E
5|$|With the Byzantines defeated, the {{authority}} of Ivan Asen III was shaken. He and his wife Irene secretly fled Tarnovo taking the Byzantine imperial insignia, kept in the treasury since the Bulgarian victory {{in the battle of}} Tryavna in 1190. Michael VIII was infuriated with the cowardliness of the couple and refused to grant them <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> days. In Tarnovo, the nobility refused to open the gates to Ivaylo and instead elected for emperor George Terter, which had devastating effect on the rebels. Despite the military successes, neither was the Mongol threat dealt with, nor was Ivaylo capable to secure the support of the Bulgarian nobility and unify the country against the overwhelming forces of the Mongols and the Byzantines. As a result, Ivaylo's followers, disillusioned with the endless wars without prospects for peace, began to abandon his cause. With diminished support, in 1280 Ivaylo crossed the Danube with a few loyal associates, including Kasim beg, to seek aid from Nogai Khan.|$|E

25|$|In a {{phenomenon}} {{which can be}} likened {{to the theory of}} cultural cringe, a considerable number of Canadians reflexively dismiss all Canadian films as inherently inferior to Hollywood studio fare. This is not necessarily connected to reality, as many critically acclaimed films have been made in Canada, but the idea nevertheless presents a significant hurdle to Canadian filmmakers seeking to build <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> their work.|$|E
25|$|Pooh is very social. After Christopher Robin, {{his closest}} friend is Piglet, and he most often chooses {{to spend his}} time with {{one or both of}} them. But he also habitually visits the other animals, often looking for a snack or <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> his poetry as much as for companionship. His kind-heartedness means he goes {{out of his way to}} be {{friendly}} to Eeyore, visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house, despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return.|$|E
25|$|Vámbéry {{was one of}} the Jewish Orientalists, like Kurban Said (who was {{possibly}} Lev Nussimbaum), who assumed Muslim identities and wrote about Muslim life. He converted four times. He was a double agent and a double dealer. He was close to the Ottoman sultans. In 1900-1901 he promised Theodor Herzl to arrange <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> him with Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamit II, but his real goal was to obtain money from Herzl, and he did not arrange the meeting. The Ottomans were merely using Herzl as a playing card in their negotiations with Maurice Rouvier of France on the consolidation of their debt.|$|E

25|$|The Matrix had {{a strong}} effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The film's {{incorporation}} of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of The Matrix created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in X-Men (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on Daredevil (2003). The Matrixs Asian approach to action scenes also created <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) {{that they might not}} otherwise have had.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, from May 23 to May 25 {{the full}} {{original}} cast (with {{the exception of}} Cindy Robinson as Snow White instead of Jean Kelly) reunited for three performances to tape the musical in its entirety for the Season 10 premiere episode of PBS’s American Playhouse, which first aired on March 15, 1991. The show was filmed professionally with seven cameras {{on the set of}} the Martin Beck Theater {{in front of an audience}} with certain elements changed from its standard production only slightly for the recording in order to better fit the screen rather than the stage such as the lighting, minor costume differences, and others. There were also pick up shots not filmed in front of <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> various purposes. This video has since been released on Tape and DVD and on occasion, remastered and re-released.|$|E
25|$|It was at Southern, in {{the same}} year he joined the station, that Hargreaves made his screen debut with the series Gone Fishing – and so, what had {{previously}} been a pastime became the focus of his wider reputation. He recounted how on his first broadcast, sitting in the studio, apprehensive at the thought of being about to talk live to a potential audience of millions, his director had reminded him that although that vast audience might be statistically daunting, it was more likely to be two or three people and perhaps a dog sitting in their front room. He aimed at conversing with such <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> the rest of his career. The director of nearly all of Hargreaves' programmes at Southern Television was George Egan who, with cameraman Stan Bréhaut, became the third ingredient of a most creative outdoor team.|$|E

25|$|Several issues {{brought about}} this melancholic state and {{restricted}} his poetic inspiration {{during the last}} five years of his life. His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century. His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realized that any true poet requires <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to feel that he had failed them both.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} Christian {{music industry}} has {{roots in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s Jesus Movement and its Jesus Music artists. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry. First, the Jesus movement produced {{a large number of}} bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb. This was in part {{due to a lack of}} appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists. Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations. According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure. Petra, for instance, struggled to find <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.|$|E
25|$|The 1920s also {{spawned a}} new age of American playwright with the {{emergence}} of Eugene O'Neill, whose plays Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape, Strange Interlude and Mourning Becomes Electra proved that there was <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> serious drama on Broadway, and O'Neill's success paved the way for major dramatists like Elmer Rice, Maxwell Anderson, Robert E. Sherwood, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller, as well as writers of comedy like George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre-goers, notably John Barrymore in Hamlet and Richard III, John Gielgud in Hamlet, The Importance of Being Earnest and Much Ado About Nothing, Walter Hampden and José Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac, Paul Robeson and Ferrer in Othello, Maurice Evans in Richard II and the plays of George Bernard Shaw, and Katharine Cornell in such plays as Romeo and Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra, and Candida.|$|E

500|$|Covering {{the event}} for Doctor Who Magazine, David Darlington {{noted that the}} stated aim of the Proms is [...] "to {{encourage}} <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> concert hall music who, though not normally attending classical concerts, would be attracted by the low ticket prices and informal atmosphere" [...] and concluded that if {{the children in the}} audience had such a love for Doctor Who [...] "that they have come all this way to spend an hour or two listening to the music from the show, and that they will happily also sit through a formal, experimental and rather abrasive piece of modern classical music and then enthusiastically applaud at the end, then all concerned can be happy with their day's work." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{concluded}} in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare Fight Club for a screening with senior executives. They {{did not receive}} the film positively and were concerned that {{there would not be}} <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> the film. Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response: [...] "So many incidences of Fight Club were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down." [...] Nevertheless, Fight Club was originally slated to be released in July 1999 but was later changed to August6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process. Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} album, Facelift, {{was released}} on August 21, 1990, peaking at number 42 {{in the summer of}} 1991 on the Billboard 200 chart.

The single hit number 18 on the Mainstream rock charts, with the album's follow up single, [...] "Sea of Sorrow", reaching number 27, and in six weeks Facelift sold 400,000 copies in the US. The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of AllMusic citing Facelift as [...] "one of the most important records in establishing <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> grunge and alternative rock among hard rock and heavy metal listeners." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ramones {{played before}} <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was {{emerging}} in New York centered on two clubs in downtown Manhattan—Max's Kansas City and, more famously, CBGB (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16, 1974. Legs McNeil, who cofounded Punk magazine the following year, later described the impact of that performance: [...] "They were all wearing these black leather jackets. And they counted off this song... and it was just this wall of noise... They looked so striking. These guys were not hippies. This was something completely new." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the serial in March brought similar praise. [...] "Our Friends in the North confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved that there was <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>for</b> political material, provided that it {{found its way to}} the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make you forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end," [...] was the verdict of The Independent on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, Jeffrey Richards added that [...] "Monday night's final episode of Our Friends in the North has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as Boys from the Blackstuff." ...|$|E

On June 16, 2012, a stage collapsed during the setup for a show at Toronto’s Downsview Park, killing drum technician Scott Johnson and injuring three others. The Toronto show and Radiohead's tour dates in Europe were postponed. After rescheduling the tour, Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson and their stage crew at their next concert, in Nîmes, France, in July. Yorke later said that finishing the tour after the collapse was his [...] "biggest achievement so far".|$|E
