Broadly it requires all assets {{to be put into}} either a general pool, a special pool or a single-asset pool. Assets in the general pool are written down at 18% while those in the special pool are written down at 8%. An asset in a single-asset pool is written down at either 8% or 18% depending on its nature. The advantage is that, on disposal, the whole of the written down value may be offset against taxable profits. The whole balance of a pool may be written off if it falls below £1,000.|$|E
40|$|Background: Section 7 of the Income Tax Act  58 of 1962 (the Act) was {{introduced}} as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent tax avoidance {{by means of}} a donation, settlement or other disposition in various types of schemes. In terms of this section, in certain circumstances, ‘income’ is deemed to be income received by or accrued to a taxpayer. Despite the fact that the term ‘income’ has been used in Section 7 from the time that it was first introduced into the Act {{and the fact that it}} is defined in section 1 of the Act, there still remains uncertainty regarding the intention of the legislature and the actual meaning of the term in terms of Section 7. Aim: The objective of the study is to understand whether the term ‘income’, as used in Sections 7 (2) to 7 (8) of the Act, is used in its defined sense or if it should be ascribed a different meaning. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African income tax environment. Method: A non-empirical study of existing literature was conducted by performing a historical analysis within a South African context. A doctrinal research approach was followed. Results: Possible interpretations determined include ‘income’ as defined in section 1 of the Act, namely ‘gross income’ (also defined) less exempt income, ‘gross income’, profits and gains or ‘taxable income’ (i. e. ‘income’ less <b>allowable</b> <b>expenditure,</b> deductions and losses) and ‘gross income’ less related deductible expenses and losses. Conclusion: It was found that the meaning of ‘income’, for purposes of Sections 7 (2) to 7 (8), remains an uncertainty, and it is recommended that the wording of Section 7 be amended to reflect the intended meaning thereof...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In accordance with Public Law 108 - 324, GAO is required to audit the reimbursement of up to $ 70 million of appropriated funds to the American Red Cross (Red Cross) for disaster relief associated with 2004 hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. The audit was performed to determine if (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) established criteria and defined <b>allowable</b> <b>expenditures</b> to ensure that reimbursement claims paid to the Red Cross met {{the purposes of the}} law, (2) reimbursement funds paid to the Red Cross did not duplicate funding by other federal sources, (3) reimbursed funds assisted only eligible states and territories for disaster relief, and (4) reimbursement claims were supported by adequate documentation. The 2004 hurricane season {{was one of the most}} destructive in U. S. history. Fifteen named storms resulted in 21 federal disaster declarations. Four hurricanes affecting 19 states and 2 U. S. territories from August 13 through September 26, 2004, triggered the nation's biggest natural-disaster response up to that time. Over 150 deaths and $ 45 billion of estimated property damage are attributed to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne in the United States alone. Through 2005, these four storms rank among the seven costliest in U. S. history. ...|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{principle}} {{is the same}} for individuals and companies - the tax applies only on the disposal of a capital asset, and the amount of the gain is calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the [...] "base cost", being the original purchase price plus <b>allowable</b> related <b>expenditure.</b> However, from 6 April 2008, the rate and reliefs applicable to the chargeable gain differ between individuals and companies. Companies apply [...] "indexation relief" [...] to the base cost, increasing it in accordance with the Retail Prices Index so that (broadly speaking) the gain is calculated on a post-inflation basis (with different rules apply for gains accrued prior to March 1982). The gain is then subject to tax at the applicable marginal rate of corporation tax.|$|R

In New Zealand there are ceilings on <b>allowable</b> electoral <b>expenditure</b> and the governing Labour Party is currently being investigated by the police for spending over the limit (through the use of its parliamentary allowance to send out material).
