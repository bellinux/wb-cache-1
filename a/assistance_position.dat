40|$|Existing devices {{assisting}} {{manual handling}} and machining processes are normally {{designed for a}} specific task and show a need for increased flexibility and automation especially for small lot sizes or products with many variants. An approach to use this potential is to apply robots {{to assist in the}} execution of task trajectories depending on the location, the process and the user. The aim of these robot assistants is to divide the labour of a handling or machining process between a human and the robot. The intention of this work was to gain substantial insights on the trajectory assistance of manual handling and machining processes to aid in developing methods and techniques for a user and task flexible control of stationary and mobile robot assistants. The developed procedure for controlling the motion of the trajectory <b>assistance's</b> <b>positioning</b> system provides a strategy for controlling several mobile, also non-holonomic, platforms. With this control mechanism it is possible to control autonomously a mobile platform during the execution of a trajectory assistance. This procedure has been tested and verified through simulations in a implemented simulation-environment. Furthermore a method for a user and task specific motion control of a manipulator was developed assisting handling and machining processes. A specific attribute of this procedure is the feasibility to control the motion of the manipulator in a fast and practical way inspite of large numbers of influencing factors such as environmental conditions, robot system, user and task while still achieving a defined quality. The developed assistance functions were verified with several robot systems and task configurations while covering the defined requirements. The results of the experiments of the robot based trajectory assistance showed the potential of the developed methods and procedures for an industrial use...|$|R
40|$|Virtual reality (VR) {{systems have}} {{experienced}} an enormous development {{during the past}} 20 years. Missing practice-relevant functionalities and high capital spendings still prevent medium-sized enterprises from introducing VR technologies and appropriate processes. In {{the context of the}} VRAX cooperative project of the Fraunhofer institutes IGD, IWU, IAO and IPK VR technologies are to be used for constantly immersive product development processes. By the example of machine tool manufacturing a VR based solution is developed in analogy to existing CAX infrastructures. For the first time VR technology is used as an active development and construction medium for modeling, i. e. data produced in VR are led back again into the total process of development. Based on the VR system Avalon, jointly developed by the Fraunhofer IGD and the ZGDV, an immersive user interface to this system is being developed. Completely free interaction, as known from CAD Applications, is only of limited use in VR environments. The main issue thereby is the missing physical feedback. Thus precise inputs are very difficult to achieve by the user. Hence the construction process has to be highly simplified. Machines usually are build up from standardized construction units with defined junction points. A goal of this work is the development of a <b>positioning</b> <b>assistance</b> that supports the user while interacting with construction units in the immersive VR environment. Construction units can be selected from a freely configurable virtual construction kit. The <b>positioning</b> <b>assistance</b> helps the user to place and connect the pieces in the virtual scene. Connected units remain moveable while defined constraints (e. g. hinge-joint) are assured by the <b>positioning</b> <b>assistance.</b> The developed solution has been integrated by the example of the construction of a machine tool.

40|$|Positioning and {{tracking}} technologies can detect {{the location and}} the movement of mobile nodes (MNs), such as cellular phone, vehicular and mobile sensor, to predict potential handoffs. However, most motion detection mechanisms require additional hardware (e. g., GPS and directed antenna), costs (e. g., power consumption and monetary cost) and supply systems (e. g., network fingerprint server). This paper proposes a Momentum of Received Signal Strength (MRSS) based motion detection method and its application on handoff. MRSS uses the exponentially weighted moving average filter with multiple moving average window size to analyze the received radio signal. With MRSS, an MN can predict its motion state and make a handoff trigger at the right time without any <b>assistance</b> from <b>positioning</b> systems. Moreover, a novel motion state dependent MRSS scheme called Dynamic MRSS (DMRSS) algorithm is proposed to adjust the motion detection sensitivity.

40|$|Pest {{damage is}} a general problem that {{disturbs}} the growth of forests, influencing carbon sequestration and causing economic losses. In the past decades, many {{studies have been conducted}} to monitor and detect forest insect damage using satellite remote sensing technology. Satellite remote sensing has a satellite or aerial vision allowing the monitoring of extensive forest areas, but it usually requires constant time periods and is prone to cloud interference. To enable more efficient and effective monitoring of forest pest damage, a video-based monitoring framework is presented. This framework comprises three key parts: (1) video positioning of forest insect damage based on digital elevation model (DEM) and the parameters obtained from the pan-tilt-zoom camera, (2) integration of two-dimensional/three-dimensional geographic information system and video surveillance to provide more intuitionistic monitoring and <b>assistance</b> for <b>positioning,</b> (3) on-site verification conducted by ground surveys and guided through global positioning system (GPS) integrated in the embedded devices. The experiment was carried out over two forest areas to validate the proposed method. Results showed that the framework bears a sound positioning accuracy and high detection ratio, which could be effectively used in detecting and monitoring forest insect defoliation and discoloration.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} shown that brain-machine {{interfaces}} (BMIs) offer great potential for restoring upper limb function. However, grasping objects is a complicated task and the signals extracted from the brain may not always be capable of driving these movements reliably. Vision-guided robotic assistance is one possible way to improve BMI performance. We describe a method of shared control where the user controls a prosthetic arm using a BMI and receives <b>assistance</b> with <b>positioning</b> the hand when it approaches an object. METHODS: Two human subjects with tetraplegia used a robotic arm to complete object transport tasks with and without shared control. The shared control system was designed to provide a balance between BMI-derived intention and computer assistance. An autonomous robotic grasping system identified and tracked objects and defined stable grasp positions for these objects. The system identified when the user intended to interact with an object based on the BMI-controlled movements of the robotic arm. Using shared control, BMI controlled movements and autonomous grasping commands were blended to ensure secure grasps. RESULTS: Both subjects were more successful on object transfer tasks when using shared control compared to BMI control alone. Movements made using shared control were more accurate, more efficient, and less difficult. One participant attempted a task with multiple objects and successfully lifted one of two closely spaced objects in 92 % of trials, demonstrating the potential for users to accurately execute their intention while using shared control. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of BMI control with vision-guided robotic assistance led to improved performance on object transfer tasks. Providing assistance while maintaining generalizability will make BMI systems more attractive to potential users. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 01364480 and NCT 01894802...|$|R

He found it still suffering from the effects of the fearful earthquake of 7 June 1692, followed by an epidemic fever, and in October Beeston writes to Lord --: 'By the mortality which yet continues I have lost all my family but my wife and one child, and have not one servant left to attend me but my cook, so it is very uneasy being here.' He goes on to beg that if his appointment is not to be permanent he may be as soon as possible recalled (Add. MS. 28878, fol. 135). In 1694 Beeston, as commander-in-chief, successfully resisted a very formidable invasion of Jamaica by the French.

40|$|Receiving {{satellite}} signals indoors gains {{importance in}} research and industry. Especially for positioning applications using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) a rising market can be observed. Low cost navigation receivers are currently capable of tracking the Global Positioning System (GPS) C/A signal down to a power of − 159 dBm without the need of <b>assistance.</b> But <b>position</b> errors due to signal blocking, diffraction and reflection make indoor navigation with an accuracy of 1 − 2 m still impossible. To mitigate errors introduced by the wireless propagation channel by equalisation for communication systems or improved time of arrival estimation for GNSS receivers, channel propagation characteristics need to be known to aid the design process for algorithms and receivers. One possible approach to gain knowledge about the propagation channel is to perform channel sounder measurements. In such a measurement campaign the transmit signal is known to the receiver and the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) can be estimated straightforward. Because a measurement is affected by all details of the real propagation medium, channel sounder measurements for the satellite navigation multipath channel are substantially needed. For GNSS application the L-band is of most interest, where almost all GNSS based navigation signals are operating. Therefore the frequency band is crowded, which motivates investigations in other frequency bands. Currently the European Space Agency (ESA) explores the possibility of satellites-to earth transmissions operating at 5 GHz. To obtain insights into the wireless propagation channel at L and C-band the German Aerospace Center (DLR) conducted channel sounder measurements at center frequency of 1. 51 GHz (L-band) {{as well as at}} 5. 2 GHz (C-band). Using a broadband signal the goal is to compare the wave propagation at both center frequencies into and inside the building.

Both studies have included assessments of problems relating to the recruitment and retention of solicitors {{in different parts of}} NSW. The aim of both studies was {{to understand the nature of}} the problem to better inform strategies to improve access to lawyers for disadvantaged people in RRR areas. The Foundation’s earlier study, Recruitment and retention of lawyers in regional, rural and remote New South Wales (Forell, Cain & Gray 2010) produced findings, not all of which were consistent with the widely held perceptions. Key findings of that research included: 	Contrary to expectations, only a low seven per cent of public legal <b>assistance</b> solicitor <b>positions</b> in NSW were vacant on the census date. However, in some remote areas: 	vacancy rates were higher 	there were substantial levels of public legal service positions occupied by ‘non-incumbent’ solicitors, which suggested difficulties in filling positions substantively 	the time that public legal solicitors served in remote positions was low, and suggested more frequent staff turnover. 	The more remote the region, the greater the ratio of residents to solicitors (i. e. fewer solicitors per thousand residents). 	Remote areas were more likely to have few, if any, solicitors. In addition, remote areas were more likely to have the youngest and least experienced solicitors (outside of Sydney). 	Some areas, for example the Far West, had particular challenges in recruiting and retaining solicitors, while other regions did not experience such difficulties...|$|R

Within the frame of our study, we carried out two outdoor experiments. In the first experiment, we compared real and subjectively perceived physical strain during two test rides in mountainous terrain – with and without electrical support. The actual physical strain is deduced from the heart rate and lactate, whereas subjectively perceived exertion is estimated using the Borg Scale.

Throughout {{the whole process}} of T-AVI, different imaging modalities are indispensable. Preoperatively, multislice computed tomography, angiography and transesophageal echo (TEE) are utilized for patient selection, valve selection, approach selection and the planning of implant placement. Intraoperatively, angiography and TEE are used for controlling placement of the guidewire and valve positioning. Quality control and follow-up require TEE imaging and can require additional CT or angiography studies.

40|$|The {{present study}} proposes a robot arm that can support precise {{positioning}} in operation by a human. The robot arm has passive and actuated joints. The passive joint is not mechanically constrained and can move passively with {{the motion of}} the output point of the robot arm. Therefore, a human can move the output point of the robot arm by his will. When a human tries to move the output point along an object path, the displacement of the passive joint is determined passively. Then, if the actuated joint is controlled so that the output point may be on the object path, the human can achieve precise positioning. Namely, using the proposed robot arm, the human can adjust the velocity, acceleration, applied force and so on by his will, while the position is preciously compensated by the actuated joint. This paper describes a mechanical form of such robot arm for drawing of planar figures and shows that the robot arm has specific singularity condition. In order to avoid the singularity condition, the proposed robot arm interchanges the actuated joint and the passive one situationally. The study fabricated the two degrees of freedom robot arm for <b>positioning</b> <b>assistance</b> and described its control method.

40|$|Background: Lifespace is {{a multidimensional}} {{construct}} {{that describes the}} geographic area {{in which a person}} lives and conducts their activities, and reflects mobility, health, and well-being. Traditionally, it has been measured by asking older people to self-report the length and frequency of trips taken and <b>assistance</b> required. Global <b>Positioning</b> System (GPS) sensors on smartphones have been used to measure Lifespace of older people, but not with people with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD). Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether GPS data collected via smartphones could be used to indicate the Lifespace of people with PD. Methods: The dataset was supplied via the Michael J Fox Foundation Data Challenge and included 9 people with PD and 7 approximately matched controls. Participants carried smartphones with GPS sensors over two months. Data analysis compared the PD group and the control group. The impact of symptom severity on Lifespace was also investigated. Results: Visualization methods for comparing Lifespace were developed including scatterplots and heatmaps. Lifespace metrics for comparison included average daily distance, percentage of time spent at home, and number of trips into the community. There were no significant differences between the PD and the control groups on Lifespace metrics. Visual representations of Lifespace were organized based on the self-reported severity of symptoms, suggesting a trend of decreasing Lifespace with increasing PD symptoms. Conclusions: Lifespace measured by GPS-enabled smartphones may be a useful concept to measure the progression of PD and the impact of various therapies and rehabilitation programs.

Many {{terminated}} executives and managers are taking advantage of the service offered by companies to help relocate a <b>position.</b> <b>Assistance</b> runs the gamut from establishing a therapeutic relationship to giving pointers on how to write a resume.

Goals and objectives are clearly defined, after which the client is en-couraged to embark on a systematic, documented job search. Support and encouragement are essential to the effectiveness of the system. Through this process, management personnel often end up in positions far more satisfying than the previous job and sometimes make more money.

They are often without support systems and have little knowledge of what else they can do or how to find a job. There is enormous anxiety and uncertainty for the person who sees jobs disap-pearing and watches long lines forming at the unemployment office. The non-professional displaced worker is a current phenomena that is swelling the ranks of the unemployed (U. S. Congress, 1986). Displace-ment is caused by a decline in industrial output, as opposed to eco-nomic recession or seasonal reductions, and has been designated as structural unemployment.
