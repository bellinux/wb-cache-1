5|$|A 1997 {{study found}} lower protein {{polymorphism}} in Antilope {{in comparison with}} Antidorcas, Eudorcas and Gazella.

This might have been aided by a particularly strong selection of a few dominant males due to its lekking behaviour.|$|E

5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942.

All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.|$|E

These consecutive final losses have been <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> famous curse by Hungarian manager Béla Guttmann in 1962.

He was the brother of Australian Test batsmen Merv and Neil and first-class cricketer and umpire Mick Harvey. Ray Harvey was an attacking and talented batsman but failed to reach international standards and only managed to hold down a regular position in the Victorian team in two seasons in the 1950s. This failure to match the standards set by his Test-capped brothers was often <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of single-mindedness and hunger.|$|E
