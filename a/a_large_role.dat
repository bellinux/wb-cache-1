5|$|Both the Sui and Tang Dynasties {{had turned}} away from the more feudal culture of the {{preceding}} Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil Confucianism. The governmental system was supported by a large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations. In the Tang period, Daoism and Buddhism reigned as core ideologies as well, and played <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in people's daily lives. The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while Chinese literature blossomed and was more widely accessible with new printing methods.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a {{contemporary}} world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC Universe, in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there. However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the Endless, and Swamp Thing made appearances.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the {{transformation}} of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, {{such as that of}} Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe. Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.|$|E

5|$|Ishigami played <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the {{implementation}} of the Wi-Fi rescue quests, and it went smoother than anticipated, something the developers attributed to their experience with developing mobile games. They were initially concerned about how the player loses all their items if they die during a rescue mission, but realized {{that it had to be}} that way to avoid people abusing rescue missions to get new items. Due to programming changes between the Japanese and the English versions of the game, rescue quests from the North American and European versions are only compatible with each other, and not with the Japanese release.|$|E
5|$|Jovanovski {{signed a}} four-year, $16.5 million {{contract}} {{to return to}} the Florida Panthers on July 1, 2011.

Beginning in his second year after rejoining the Panthers, he served as team captain for the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons. On June 29, 2014, Jovanovski was placed on unconditional waivers for the purpose of a buyout. Jovanovski remained inactive in the NHL during the 2014–15 season. On December 28, 2015 Jovanovski announced his retirement from the NHL.|$|E

Their music {{is marked by}} Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the band's elaborate live shows.

5|$|Nigeria is the 12th largest {{producer}} of petroleum {{in the world}} and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves. (The country joined OPEC in 1971). Petroleum plays <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of GDP and 80% of Government earnings. However, agitation for better resource control in the Niger Delta, its main oil producing region, has led to disruptions in oil production and prevents the country from exporting at 100% capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System. The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and {{the disruption of}} radio communications and electric power. Solar activity {{is thought to have}} played <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{military}} action in Anbar Province occurred on 26 October 2008, {{when a group of}} Army Special Forces conducted a raid into Syria to kill Abu Ghadiya, the leader of a network of foreign fighters who were traveling through Syria. Anbar continued to play <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the Iraqi insurgency. That same month AQI announced the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), an umbrella group led by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, a cleric from Anbar. After both Al-Baghdadi and Al-Masri were killed in Tikrit in April 2010, the US believed the new leader of AQI/ISI was Abu Dua al-Badri, a former Emir of Rawa who was married to a woman from Fallujah.|$|E

5|$|The {{private sector}} has also played <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in revitalizing the area, even without public aid and incentives. Developers have been {{attracted}} to the historic buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods, calling it the city's strongest asset, although they have complained about past stalemates in city government. One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without any public effort or intent, and {{the restoration of the}} music hall at the Savings Bank led to many new restaurants opening in the neighborhood. The blocks of River Street north of Monument Square have a dozen woman-owned businesses.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been a general feeling of a shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
5|$|Wander's horse, Agro, plays <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>role</b> in the game. In {{addition}} to {{serving as a}} means of transportation, fighting from horseback is vital to defeat some of the colossi. There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle. Agro is referred to as a male in the English-language version of the game, though director Fumito Ueda said that he saw Wander's horse as female.|$|E
