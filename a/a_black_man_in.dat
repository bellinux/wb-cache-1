5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then.|$|E
5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E

25|$|Wright {{was criticized}} for his {{concentration}} on violence in his works. In the case of Native Son, people complained that he portrayed <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of Native Son was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by Edwin Rosskam. While in Chicago he visited the American Negro Exhibition with Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps and Claude McKay.|$|E
25|$|In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and {{extensive}} refurbishment was undertaken. J B Priestley {{presided over the}} opening ceremony of the first summer season, and under director John Ridley, the Festival opened on 8 July and ran until 2 October. A production of Priestley's An Inspector Calls, starring Anne Kristen, Julian Curry, Daphne Heard and William Roderick was produced. In February 1966, a successful production of Shakespeare's Othello was produced at Malvern Theatre, causing initial controversy when Rudolph Walker, in his first professional role, portrayed Othello, being <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> May of that year, fans of The Who, angered that the group's van had broke down before they were due to play a gig at the Winter Gardens in Malvern, smashed {{the windows of the}} theatre.|$|E

25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations of life as <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales like Home to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, {{and a variety of}} sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E
25|$|Sparked by {{the alleged}} rape {{of a white}} woman by a black man and {{the murder of a}} white engineer, {{supposedly}} also by <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> <b>in</b> Springfield, and reportedly angered by the high degree of corruption in the city, some white residents took their anxiety and frustration out on blacks. Rioting broke out on August 14, 1908 and continued for three days in a period of violence known as the Springfield Race Riot. Gangs of white youth and blue-collar workers attacked the predominantly black areas of the city known as the Levee district, where most black businesses were located, and the Badlands, where many black residences stood. Two blacks were lynched and four whites were killed by gunfire when black property-owners sought to defend their homes and businesses. The riot ended when the governor sent in more than 3,700 militiamen to patrol the city, but isolated incidents of white violence against blacks continued in Springfield into September.|$|E
25|$|When Ward {{was twelve}} years old, his mother died {{unexpectedly}} during childbirth and, in the ensuing chaos, the young man left home to travel around the United States by freight train. He headed north, supporting himself with occasional work as a boot-black, hotel bellboy, and barber-shop porter, but eventually ended up in jail for bootlegging in Salt Lake City, Utah. Ward rediscovered his love for writing, and eventually amassed an impressive corpus of poetry, short stories, and essays that helped him to gain entry into an extension program at the University of Utah in 1930. While there, his professor, Louis Zucker, encouraged Ward {{to apply for the}} prestigious Zona Gale Fellowship in creative writing at the University of Wisconsin. Ward's essay won the prize, and he departed for the one-year program in Madison, where he studied literature and dramatic arts in addition to working as a script writer and voice actor for WIBA-Radio Madison. Although Zona Gale personally extended Ward's fellowship and arranged for him to stay and enter a degree program despite his lack of a high school education, the young man declined, citing the unendurable isolation suffered by <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> an all-white school.|$|E

However, the police were able to secure the orphanage for enough time to allow the orphans to escape before the building burned down. Throughout the areas of rioting, mobs attacked and killed at least 120 black people and destroyed their known homes and businesses, such as James McCune Smith's pharmacy at 93 West Broadway, {{believed to be the}} first owned by <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E
500|$|Several songs {{have been}} {{produced}} {{in response to the}} Jena Six case.

[...] The video juxtaposes images of Jena, the high school, and the tree with video from the 1960s, including civil rights marchers and police beatings. Video of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King speaking and an image of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> shackles are also included in the video. The song and video led to Jena's mayor, Murphy R. McMillan, issuing a statement rebutting the accusations he believed were expressed and implied in the video. An episode of the Salt-N-Pepa Show on VH1 was filmed at the Jena rally. Bomani Armah released a song called [...] "Jena 6".|$|E
500|$|Both legal teams, in {{planning}} their trial strategy, considered {{the implications of}} trying a white man based on the testimony of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> front of an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South, writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as [...] "a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous." [...] Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as [...] "a familiar type" [...] of [...] "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker. [...] Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man {{could not have been}} intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining {{the immediate aftermath of the}} murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.|$|E

2500|$|While Dunham was {{recognized}} as [...] "unofficially" [...] representing American cultural life in her foreign tours, she was given very little assistance of any kind by the U.S. State Department.

Its premiere performance on December 9, 1950, at the Teatro Municipal in Santiago, Chile, generated considerable public interest {{in the early months}} of 1951. The State Department was dismayed by the negative view of American society that the ballet presented to foreign audiences. As a result, Dunham would later experience some diplomatic [...] "difficulties" [...] on her tours. The State Department regularly subsidized other less well-known groups, but it consistently refused to support her company (even when it was entertaining U.S. Army troops), although {{at the same time it}} did not hesitate to take credit for them as [...] "unofficial artistic and cultural representatives." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is no {{coincidence}} that Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. was founded in the year 1913. That year was a pivotal year for issues regarding race and equality in the United States.

And in February of the same year, Rosa McCauley (later Rosa Parks) the [...] "Mother of the Civil rights movement" [...] was born in Tuskegee, Alabama.
