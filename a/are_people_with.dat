5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.|$|E

60|$|As {{he strode}} up a village street, {{brooding}} thus, his eyes encountered a complete contrast {{in the face}} of his other rival, the Reform candidate. Eric Hughes, with his blown blond hair and eager undergraduate face, was just getting into his motor car and saying a few final words to his agent, a sturdy, grizzled man named Gryce. Eric Hughes waved his hand in a friendly fashion; but Gryce eyed him with some hostility. Eric Hughes was a young man with genuine political enthusiasms, but he knew that political opponents <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> whom one may have to dine any day. But Mr. Gryce was a grim little local Radical, a champion of the chapel, and one of those happy people whose work is also their hobby. He turned his back as the motor car drove away, and walked briskly up the sunlit high street of the little town, whistling, with political papers sticking out of his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|The Academician's {{theory is}} stated {{in a short}} essay, De l'Origine des Fables (OEuvres: Paris, 1758, vol. iii. p.270). We have been so {{accustomed}} from childhood, he says, to the absurdities of Greek myth, that we have ceased {{to be aware that}} they are absurd. Why are the legends of men and beasts and Gods so incredible and revolting? Why have we ceased to tell such tales? The answer is, that early men were in [...] "a state of almost inconceivable savagery and ignorance," [...] and that the Greek myths are inherited from people in that condition. [...] "Look at the Kaffirs and Iroquois," [...] says Fontenelle, [...] "if you wish to know what early men were like; and remember that even the Iroquois and Kaffirs <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> a long past, with knowledge and culture (politesse) which the first men did not enjoy." [...] Now the more ignorant a man is, the more prodigies he supposes himself to behold. Thus the first narratives of the earliest men were full of monstrous things, [...] "parce qu'ils etoient faits par des gens sujets a voir bien des choses qui n'etaient pas". This condition answers, in Mr. Tylor's system, to the confusion the savage makes between dreams and facts, and to the hallucinations which beset him when he does not get his regular meals. Here, then, we have a groundwork of irresponsible fancy.|$|E
60|$|At {{dawn the}} old man himself appeared, {{and told us that}} he had by using She's dreadful name, though with some difficulty, succeeded in getting the {{necessary}} men and two guides to conduct us across the swamps, and that he urged us to start at once, at the same time announcing his intention of accompanying us so as to protect us against treachery. I was much touched by this act of kindness on the part of that wily old barbarian towards two utterly defenceless strangers. A three--or in his case, for he would have to return, six--days' journey through those deadly swamps was no light undertaking for a man of his age, but he consented to do it cheerfully in order to promote our safety. It shows that even among those dreadful Amahagger--who are certainly with their gloom and their devilish and ferocious rites by far the most terrible savages that I ever heard of--there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> kindly hearts. Of course, self-interest may {{have had something to do}} with it. He may have thought that She would suddenly reappear and demand an account of us at his hands, but still, allowing for all deductions, it was a great deal more than we could expect under the circumstances, and I can only say that I shall for as long as I live cherish a most affectionate remembrance of my nominal parent, old Billali.|$|E
