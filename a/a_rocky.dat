5|$|Al Jalali Fort lies on <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> outcrop on {{the east}} side of the Muscat harbor. It faces Fort Al-Mirani, which is built on another outcrop on the west side. Muscat was {{strongly}} defended against attack from the sea by these twin forts, by the Muttrah fort further to the west and by other fortifications on the rocky ridges surrounding the bay.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower outer wall, enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where {{the outline of a}} fish pond can be seen.|$|E

50|$|Many {{songs on}} the album have, by Lakeman's own admission, <b>a</b> <b>rockier</b> sound than his earlier, arguably more straightforwardly {{acoustic}} folk, material. The transition into this sound could be argued to originate in the live versions of the Freedom Fields tracks from the respective tour, since {{many of them had}} <b>a</b> <b>rockier</b> element added (most notably on the chorus on 'The Colliers'). Indeed, Lakeman said that the decision to release the Poor Man's Heaven EP was partly to introduce this new direction to his listeners.|$|R
5000|$|In September, Holliday led the NL with 32 RBI, setting <b>a</b> <b>Rockies</b> {{record for}} that month. On September 20 against the Padres, he hit {{two home runs}} and tied <b>a</b> <b>Rockies</b> single-game record with eight RBI in <b>a</b> <b>Rockies</b> 20-1 victory, the highest single-game RBI total in the NL in 2005 and second-highest in the major leagues. [...] He ended {{the season with a}} seven-game hitting streak and reached base in each of the Rockies final 22 games. [...] Holliday totaled 125 games and {{improved}} in nearly all offensive categories from the his rookie year, including 147 hits, 19 home runs, 87 RBI, 68 runs, 14 stolen bases, 242 total bases, 505 SLG and [...]361 OBP. His [...]307 batting average placed eighth in the NL. [...] The club picked up his option for 2006, which was worth $500,000 ($ today), or about $100,000 ($ today) more than the average for a player with equivalent service time. [...] He was selected as the Rockies Player of the Year.|$|R
5|$|Further downstream, {{the creek}} passes through Fair Oaks Ranch and Bulverde. The steady flow begins to {{dissipate}} {{in certain areas}} as it approaches Camp Bullis in northern San Antonio, leaving dry patches that reveal <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> bottom. Such dry patches continue as it heads east, forming the boundary between Bexar and Comal Counties. Steady flows {{pick up on the}} boundary between Bexar and Guadalupe Counties, passing through Randolph Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked {{to discover a}} transit event using the Infrared Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as ground-based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> planet. While the observations did not suggest that Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few orbital parameters were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> outcrop. An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E

A line of people on horses is visible on a trail that extends from the left {{foreground}} to the right center, towards the background. To their right, <b>a</b> down-sloped <b>rocky</b> ground is partially covered by snow and, to their left, <b>a</b> steep <b>rocky</b> mountainside is visible with patches of snow...|$|R
5000|$|In <b>a</b> circus, <b>Rocky</b> is {{preparing}} to jump from a high diving board into a tub of water tended by Bullwinkle. However, when Rocky jumps, he ends up flying around the circus tent, while Bullwinkle chases after him carrying the tub. <b>As</b> <b>Rocky</b> lands safely, Bullwinkle tumbles into the tub. This was the same intro used for the Buena Vista VHS series in the early 1990s.|$|R

5|$|The Andean cock-of-the-rock {{exhibits}} marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{has a large}} disk-like crest and scarlet or brilliant orange plumage, while the female is significantly darker and browner. Gatherings of males compete for breeding females with each male displaying its colourful plumage, bobbing and hopping, and making a variety of calls. After mating, the female makes a nest under <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> overhang, incubates the eggs, and rears the young, all by herself.|$|E
5|$|The Badlands are <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> and hilly valley on the {{northern}} borders of the Septimus Heap world, where DomDaniel once practised his dark magic in an observatory atop a hill. They are inhabited by Land Wurms, giant carnivorous snakelike animals, making them a dangerous place. Simon Heap also used to live there with Lucy Gringe.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists {{immediately}} {{opened fire}} upon the Free State force, {{who remained in}} cover behind <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> outcropping some ways from the Mahdist line. For half an hour the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies to little effect, their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, Free State soldiers moved a Krupp gun into position which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, 2008, Bellorín {{recorded}} his first MLB hit, an infield single, off Billy Sadler {{in the top}} of the seventh inning of <b>a</b> <b>Rockies</b> 15-6 road victory over the San Francisco Giants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, Australian {{pop star}} Normie Rowe {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>rockier</b> version. This proved popular {{in its own}} right and appeared on the B-side of his Australian top 10 hit, [...] "I (Who Have Nothing)".|$|R
50|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{the shift to}} <b>a</b> <b>rockier</b> emphasis, Lakeman denies that the album is any less acoustic or more electric than his earlier material, pointing out that all the tracks are still almost exclusively performed on acoustic instruments.|$|R
5|$|The long orchestral prelude (166 bars) is in E minor and, in {{the manner}} of an operatic overture, anticipates several of the themes which will be heard later in the movement. The {{exposition}} begins in near-silence; the scene depicted is that of <b>a</b> <b>rocky,</b> wooded mountainside, the dwelling place of anchorites whose utterances are heard in an atmospheric chorus complete with whispers and echoes.|$|E
5|$|The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit {{consists}} of a troop of hamadryas baboons. Zoo visitors may observe the troop in a large glassed-in gallery which looks out into <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> outcrop. Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather. The rear wall of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other social aspects of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe the troop.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} Coeffin Castle {{stand on the}} summit of <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> {{promontory}} on the coast west of Clachan. There is the outline of an oblong hall-house, which may be 13th century, and an irregularly shaped bailey, likely of a later date. A tidal fish trap, of unknown age, {{is located in the}} small bay to the south-east of the castle. To the north-east of the castle are the remains of a stone-walled fort.|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the center}} field {{wall is a}} {{landscape}} decoration that reflects the typical environment of the Rocky Mountains. This landscape area consists of a waterfall, fountains, and pine trees. After <b>a</b> <b>Rockies</b> home run or win, the fountains shoot high into the air.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Don't Cry Sister" [...] was re-recorded in <b>a</b> <b>rockier</b> way by Cale and Eric Clapton {{on their}} {{collaborative}} album The Road to Escondido. Twisted Ear called the version [...] "terrible", with [...] "all the intimacy, all the emotion, gone".|$|R
5000|$|Having {{topped the}} charts {{around the world}} with Welcome to the Pleasuredome and its {{accompanying}} singles, Frankie Goes to Hollywood took off to Amsterdam to record the follow-up album, Liverpool. Taking on <b>a</b> <b>rockier</b> edge, [...] "Rage Hard" [...] was the first single culled from the disc.|$|R
5|$|The temple {{complex is}} on <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> ridge over which {{an array of}} {{monolithic}} (made of a single block of stone) temples have been carved which resemble the monolithic temples of Mahabalipuram, Ellora and Dhamnar caves. The central temple of this complex, called the Thakurdwara, has extensive well crafted carvings. This shrine facing east has idols of Ram, Lakshman and Sita (made of black-stone).|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the tower is a range of {{buildings}} built against the thick, buttressed, 14th-century curtain wall. The great hall occupied the central part of this range, with the lord's private apartments of great chamber and solar in the block to the north, and kitchens to the south. The foundations of a rectangular building stand on <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the ruins}} of Castell y Bere still stand on <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> outcrop, with {{protective}} ditches cut into the stone on {{the south and east}} sides. The entrance to the castle lies on the west side, where the barbican, probably built by Edward I, contains two gatetowers, overlooking the stone steps approaching the inner gate. Through the barbican is the castle courtyard, containing a large well and the remains of several internal buildings of uncertain date.|$|E

50|$|After Cozy Powell {{decided to}} fold Hammer, Murray and Airey joined a revamped {{version of the}} British jazz rock band Colosseum, named Colosseum II. The band's leader, drummer Jon Hiseman, had evolved the band's sound by {{eliminating}} the saxophone in preference for <b>a</b> <b>rockier</b> sound courtesy of Gary Moore's guitar.|$|R
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E
5|$|Al-Birwa {{stood on}} <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> hill {{overlooking}} the Acre plain, {{with an average}} elevation of 60 meters above sea level. It was situated {{at the intersection of}} two highways—one led to Acre and the other towards Haifa. Located 10.5 kilometers east of Acre, the other nearest localities to al-Birwa included al-Damun (depopulated in 1948) to the south, and the Arab towns of Jadeida to the northwest, Julis to the north, Sha'ab to the east, and Majd al-Kurum to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Augustine St. Clare – Tom's {{third owner}} {{and father of}} Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After <b>a</b> <b>rocky</b> {{courtship}} he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt, though he is too polite to let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
