5|$|Metrolink has one Special Purpose Vehicle from 1991. Numbered 1027 {{with its}} support wagon 1028, it is a bespoke {{diesel-powered}} vehicle with a crane, inspection platform, mobile workshop, and capacity for a driver and three passengers. It {{was designed to}} assist with vehicle recovery and track <b>and</b> <b>line</b> repairs.|$|E
5|$|Modern Leslie {{speakers}} have an 11-pin interface that {{is safer}} to service, as the mains power is carried separately using a standard IEC mains connector. The Hammond-Suzuki Leslie 2101 also includes line in <b>and</b> <b>line</b> out jacks, so a combo preamp {{is no longer}} required. Its settings can also be controlled via MIDI.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{serviced}} by the LRT Line 1 <b>and</b> <b>Line</b> 2, which form the Manila Light Rail Transit System. Development of the railway system {{began in the}} 1970s under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, when Line 1 was built, making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia. These systems are currently undergoing a multibillion-dollar expansion. Line 1 runs {{along the length of}} Taft Avenue (N170/R-2) and Rizal Avenue (N150/R-9), <b>and</b> <b>Line</b> 2 runs along Claro M. Recto Avenue (N145/C-1) and Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard (N180/R-6) from Santa Cruz, through Quezon City, up to Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal.|$|E

The drainage system of the watershed is a trellis pattern, a dentritic pattern, or an angular drainage pattern.|$|E
5|$|The station serves several bus routes. Lines 23 and 24 along Ring 3 from Lysaker to Simensbråten, and Brynseng to Fornebu stop at Sinsen. Line 31 runs via Sinsen from Grorud to Snarøya, as does line 33 from Ellingsrudåsen to Filipstad, <b>and</b> <b>line</b> 58 from Helsfyr to Nydalen.|$|E

5|$|A {{separate}} device {{known as}} the combo preamp is necessary to connect a vintage Leslie to another instrument such as a guitar. This combines a separate AC input <b>and</b> <b>line</b> level input onto a single amphenol connector, and provide a footswitch to select between the speeds of the Leslie. Modern products such as the Trek II UC-1A allow any instrument with a phone jack connection to {{use a variety of}} Leslie speakers.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel <b>and</b> <b>line</b> {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook <b>and</b> <b>line</b> fishing was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E

5|$|Carl Berners plass is an {{underground}} rapid transit station {{located on the}} Grorud Line of the Oslo Metro, and a tram stop on the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway. The square also has a bus stop for lines 20, 21, 31 and 33. Located at Helsfyr in Oslo, Norway, the area has a mixture of apartment buildings and small businesses. The station is the first metro station on the Grorud Line after it branches off from the shared Common Tunnel. North of the station, the Ring Line branches off from the Grorud Line. The station is served by line 5 of the metro <b>and</b> <b>Line</b> 17 of the tramway, with four hourly departures during regular hours. The tram operates every 10 minutes during regular hours.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef squids (particularly in jigging) are usually done {{at night and}} utilise bright lights, taking advantage of their attraction to illumination. They are especially abundant during the full moon and in foggy weather. Populations of bigfin reef squids are not seasonal, {{and they can be}} fished throughout the year. They are also used as fish bait in hook <b>and</b> <b>line</b> fishing.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the hardnose shark {{is caught}} with {{gillnets}} <b>and</b> <b>line</b> gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries {{across much of}} its range. It is used for meat, which is sold fresh or dried and salted, though its small size limits its economic importance. Its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to overfishing, and given existing levels of exploitation, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened. Off northern Australia, the hardnose shark makes up 13.6% of the gillnet catch and 4.0% of the longline catch. Since these losses {{do not appear to}} have diminished its population there, the IUCN has given it a regional assessment of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|In 1994 the {{operation}} of the network was privatised, along with the country's railways, and is now managed by Metrovías. SBASE (as part of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires) maintained ownership the network, its rolling stock and infrastructure, and administers its expansion and budget. One cosmetic change carried out in the 1990s under private operation was the re-assignation of the colours of the lines, with Lines B and D switching colours, Line C changing from purple to blue <b>and</b> <b>Line</b> E changing from yellow to purple. The change of colours was also accompanied by a standardisation of the network's signage to match the new schemes.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, {{work on the}} Princes Street section stopped due to {{contractual}} disagreements between TIE and BSC {{after the}} latter submitted a request for an additional £80 million of funding. Edinburgh Council believed the contractors' claims were unjustified as they had agreed to fixed-price contracts. After negotiations, BSC agreed to commence construction in March 2009 within the original budget, although disagreements remained. Work restarted <b>and</b> <b>line</b> construction went ahead.|$|E

During the same period, Line H was opened 2007, making it the first completely new line on the underground since Line E, excluding the Premetro. There have also been significant modernisations of infrastructure, signalling systems, stations and the network's rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook <b>and</b> <b>line</b> to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E
5|$|Storo opened as a tram station {{as part of}} the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line on 28 November 1902. It {{is located}} about 200 meters from Grefsen Station of the Gjøvik Line.
