5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> pets.|$|E
5|$|In October 1939, Hitler and Mussolini {{concluded}} the South Tyrol Option Agreement {{under which the}} German-speaking population of South Tyrol was given the choice of complete Italianisation—abandoning their German language <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> personal names—or emigrating to Nazi Germany. As a result, Hess {{and his family were}} forced to return to Germany. Attempts to emigrate to Switzerland or Brazil failed, so they moved briefly back to Düsseldorf before resettling in Unterwössen, a small village in the district of Traunstein in the far south-east of Bavaria, where his daughter attended the Landschulheim Marquartstein, a local gymnasium and boarding school.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> teeth until their final days.|$|E

5|$|The {{bombing was}} planned and {{performed}} by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow {{after the war}} had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It was a six-story building and had 193bedrooms. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, mixing with the crowds in the busy street outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers {{so that they could}} copy their mannerisms, speaking style <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.|$|E
5|$|The young Ahmad ibn Tulun {{received}} a thorough education, involving military {{training at the}} new Abbasid capital of Samarra and studies in Islamic theology at Tarsus, acquiring a reputation not only for his knowledge but also for his pious and ascetic way of life. He became popular among his fellow Turks, who would confide secrets and entrust their money <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> women to him. While at Tarsus, Ibn Tulun fought in the frontier wars with the Byzantine Empire. There he also met another senior Turkish leader, Yarjukh, whose daughter, variously given as Majur or Khatun, became his first wife {{and the mother of}} his eldest son, Abbas, and his daughter Fatimah. The sources also report that during his time at Tarsus, Ibn Tulun had ties to Caliph al-Mutawakkil's vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, and the latter's cousin Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khaqan. On one occasion, while returning to Samarra, he saved a caravan bearing a caliphal envoy returning from Constantinople from a Bedouin raiding party, and accompanied it to Samarra. This act gained him the favour of Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862–866), as well as a thousand gold dinars and the hand of the slave Miyas, the mother of his second son, Khumarawayh. When the Caliph abdicated and went into exile at Wasit in 866, he chose Ibn Tulun to be his guard. Qubayha, the mother of the new caliph, al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869), schemed to remove the deposed al-Musta'in, and offered Ibn Tulun the governorship of Wasit if he would murder him. Ibn Tulun refused and was replaced by another, who carried out the deed. Ibn Tulun himself played no part in the assassination, but gave his master a burial and returned to Samarra.|$|E

25|$|One {{explanation}} is that social-media users usually split their time between Facebook and interacting in the real world. When something entertaining happens in real life, people {{feel the need to}} share it. It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, people start to change their behavior <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to cognitive dissonance. Such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage people's emotional balance and lead them to experience identity confusion, relationship conflicts, changes in judgement, and even psychotic break.|$|E
25|$|Other {{races of}} Men are {{mentioned}} in Tolkien's work, though {{they play a}} relatively small part {{in the history of}} Middle-earth. Among these are the Lossoth, a hardy people native to the Ice Bay of Forochel in the far north. A race of wicked Men descended from wild Hill-folk inhabited the realm of Angmar and served its Witch-king until the fall of that kingdom. Tolkien also makes reference to Giants in The Hobbit. These Giants {{may be related to the}} race of Man, though the scant information about them had led to debate over their exact nature <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> existence as an independent race in Tolkien's world.|$|E

25|$|On 12 January 1881 three Chilean {{formations}} (referred to as divisions) {{stepped off}} from Lurín toward Chorrillos at about 4 p.m., reaching their attack positions at around 3:00a.m. {{of the next}} day. At 5:00a.m. began {{the assault on the}} Peruvian forts: Lynch's division charged Iglesias's positions (Morro Solar to Santa Teresa), Sotomayor's men against Caceres's sector (Santa Teresa to San Juan) and Lagos's division charged Davila's sector (San Juan to Monterrico Chico). Chilean and Peruvian soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat, attacking one another with rifles, bayonets, rocks <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> bare hands. At the beginning, Sotomayor was unable to deploy in time and Lynch's advance was repulsed. Baquedano was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage Lynch's flank. At 8:00am the Peruvian defenders were forced to withdraw from San Juan and Santa Teresa to Morro Solar and Chorrillos (town). At 12:00 midday Morro Solar was captured and the battle continued into Chorrillos, which fell at 14:00 hours (2pm). During the Battle of Chorrillos, the Chileans inflicted a harsh defeat on the regular Peruvian forces, eliminating Lima's first defensive line. Two days later, the second line of defense was also penetrated in the Battle of Miraflores.|$|E

The farthest advance of Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead's brigade of Maj. Gen. George Pickett's division at the Angle {{is referred to as}} the [...] "High-water mark of the Confederacy", arguably representing the closest the South ever came to its goal of achieving independence from the Union via military victory. Union and Confederate soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat, attacking with their rifles, bayonets, rocks <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>their</b> bare hands. Armistead ordered his Confederates to turn two captured cannons against Union troops, but discovered that there was no ammunition left, the last double canister shots having been used against the charging Confederates. Armistead was wounded shortly afterward three times.|$|E
