50|$|The entire {{route of}} 41 miles {{was ready to}} be opened throughout, and this was done for {{passenger}} and goods trains on 12 August 1867. The construction and <b>ancillary</b> <b>expenditure</b> amounted to £700,000, of which £75,000 was on the Llangurig section, now abandoned. The train service consisted of three trains each way Monday to Friday. At first the service was operated by the contractors, using three Sharp, Stewart locomotives.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the potential reconversion to recreational uses of a brownfield {{area on the}} shoreline of Muggia, a North-East Italy village. We perform a socio-economic assessment of the value to society of such a reconversion compared with alternative scenarios (business as usual, or excavation). We make use of a consistent Cost-Benefit Analysis framework which, to our knowledge, has had limited application {{in this area of}} research. We investigate the existing methods to value the benefits of the area, including the “Economic Impact” and analyze why they would not be appropriate to provide normative recommendations. As an alternative, we propose a parsimonious method for valuing the recreational value in a context where available data are minimal. We also investigate with care how <b>ancillary</b> <b>expenditures</b> (typically travel costs {{associated with the use of}} the recreational area) and externalities have to be taken into account in the evaluation. Our results strongly support the reconversion of the area to recreational functions...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of {{inequality of opportunity}} has hitherto not been attempted {{in a number of}} countries because of data limitations. This paper proposes two alternative approaches to circumventing the missing data problems in countries where a demographic and health survey (DHS) and an <b>ancillary</b> household <b>expenditure</b> survey are available. One method relies only on the DHS, and constructs a wealth index as a measure of economic advantage. The alternative method imputes consumption from the ancillary survey into the DHS. In both cases, we compute a lower bound estimator of the share of (ex-ante) inequality of opportunity in total inequality. Parametric and non-parametric estimates are calculated for each method, and the parametric approach is shown to yield preferable lower-bound measures. In an application to the sample of ever-married women aged 30 - 49 in Turkey, inequality of opportunity accounts for at least 26 % (31 %) of overall inequality in imputed consumption (the wealth index) ...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to assess the actual impact of {{healthcare}} public financing on population health status, while controlling for other non-financial health determinants. There are plenty of heterogeneous studies dealing with the negative or positive effects of different products consumption (e. g. sugar, alcohol, tobacco, fruits, vegetables, etc.) on people’s health. Starting from the relevant ones, we kept for our models those non-financial variables with public available data, used as control variables. After performing variable selection, we ranked the actual impact of different public expenditures categories on health status change, using simple and multiple regression fixed-effects techniques on a panel dataset regarding the European members of OECD (ranging from 1970 to 2014).   Our results show that financing preventive care has the strongest positive impact on the health status, followed by auxiliary (<b>ancillary)</b> services. Administrative <b>expenditures</b> for the healthcare system do not have a significant influence, suggesting there is available room to enhance the effectiveness and performance of sanitary institutions management. Our results also show that life expectancy is negatively affected by the consumption of alcohol and sugar, in a decreasing order. These results were then connected with Romanian realities regarding health care financing and people’s consumption habits. In strong connection with our findings and these realities, this study provides, as a final part, a set of policy recommendations useful for Romanian public authorities in designing their policies, as well as for other interested non-governmental actors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: To compare VA {{inpatient}} and outpatient utilization and expenditures {{of veterans}} seeking primary care in community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) and VA medical centers (VAMCs) in fiscal years 2000 (FY 00) and 2001. Methods: The sample included 25, 092 patients who obtained primary care exclusively from 108 CBOCs in FY 00, 26, 936 patients who obtained primary care exclusively from 72 affiliated VAMCs in FY 00, and 11, 450 "crossover" patients who obtained primary care in CBOCs and VAMCs in FY 00. VA utilization and expenditure data {{were drawn from}} the VA's system-wide cost accounting system. Veteran demographic characteristics and a 1999 Diagnostic Cost Group risk score were obtained from VA administrative files. Outpatient utilization (primary care, specialty care, mental health, pharmacy, radiology and laboratory) and inpatient utilization were estimated using count data models and expenditures were estimated using one-part or two-part models. The second part of two-part models was estimated using generalized linear regressions. Results: CBOC patients had a slightly more primary care visits per year than VAMC patients (p less than 0. 0001), but lower primary care costs (-$ 71, p less than 0. 0001). CBOC patients had lower odds {{of one or more}} specialty, mental health, ancillary visits and hospital stays per year, and fewer numbers of visits and stays if they had any and lower specialty, mental health, <b>ancillary</b> and inpatient <b>expenditures</b> (all, p less than 0. 0001). As a result, CBOC patients had lower total outpatient and overall expenditures than VAMC patients (p less than 0. 0001). Conclusion: CBOCs provided veterans improved access to primary care and other services, but expenditures were contained because CBOC patients who sought health care had fewer visits and hospital stays than comparable VAMC patients. These results suggest a more complex pattern of health care utilization and expenditures by CBOC patients than has been found in prior studies. This study also illustrates that CBOCs continue to be a critical primary care and mental health access point for veterans.
