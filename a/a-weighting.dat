5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel <b>A-weighting</b> (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
25|$|The <b>A-weighting</b> curve {{has been}} widely adopted for {{environmental}} noise measurement, and is standard in many sound level meters. The <b>A-weighting</b> system is used in any measurement of environmental noise (examples of which include roadway noise, rail noise, aircraft noise). <b>A-weighting</b> is also in common use for assessing potential hearing damage caused by loud noise.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, it will {{be noted}} that <b>A-weighting</b> {{would be a better}} match to the {{loudness}} curve if it fell much more steeply above 10kHz, and it is likely that this compromise came about because steep filters were difficult to construct {{in the early days of}} electronics.

If <b>A-weighting</b> is used without further band-limiting it is possible to obtain different readings on different instruments when ultrasonic, or near ultrasonic noise is present.

25|$|<b>A-weighting</b> is {{only really}} valid for {{relatively}} quiet sounds and for pure tones {{as it is}} based on the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curves which represented an early determination of the equal-loudness contour for human hearing.|$|E
25|$|<b>A-weighting</b> {{began with}} work by Fletcher and Munson which {{resulted}} in their publication, in 1933, {{of a set of}} equal-loudness contours. Three years later these curves were used in the first American standard for sound level meters. This ANSI standard, later revised as ANSI S1.4-1981, incorporated B-weighting as well as the <b>A-weighting</b> curve, recognising the unsuitability of the latter for anything other than low-level measurements. But B-weighting has since fallen into disuse. Later work, first by Zwicker and then by Schomer, attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by different levels, and work by the BBC resulted in the CCIR-468 weighting, currently maintained as ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which gives more representative readings on noise as opposed to pure tones.|$|E
25|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI) and, , is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by Dolby Laboratories who realised its superior validity for their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over <b>A-weighting</b> is less understood in the US, where the use of <b>A-weighting</b> still predominates. It is universally used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the human}} ear {{does not have}} a flat {{spectral}} response, sound pressures are often frequency weighted so that the measured level matches perceived levels more closely. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has defined several weighting schemes. <b>A-weighting</b> attempts to match the response of the human ear to noise and A-weighted sound pressure levels are labeled dBA. C-weighting is used to measure peak levels.|$|E
25|$|Grey {{noise is}} random white noise {{subjected}} to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve (such as an inverted <b>A-weighting</b> curve) over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies. This {{is in contrast to}} standard white noise which has equal strength over a linear scale of frequencies but is not perceived as being equally loud due to biases in the human equal-loudness contour.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>A-weighting</b> {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a quasi-peak detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.|$|E
25|$|The curves were {{originally}} defined for use at different average sound levels, but <b>A-weighting,</b> though originally intended {{only for the}} measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 phon), is now commonly used for the measurement of environmental noise and industrial noise, as well as when assessing potential hearing damage and other noise health effects at all sound levels; indeed, the use of A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for all these measurements, although it is badly suited for these purposes, being only applicable to low levels so that it tends to devalue the effects of low frequency noise in particular.|$|E
25|$|This {{enhanced}} {{sensitivity to}} {{noise in the}} region of 6kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of compact cassette recorders and Dolby-B noise reduction. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19kHz pilot tone on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible is not sufficiently attenuated by <b>A-weighting,</b> so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing spectral content.|$|E
25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting in sound level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter in a sound level meter, to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing. (see <b>A-weighting).</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>A-weighting</b> curve, in {{widespread}} use for noise measurement, {{is said to}} have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1kHz and a downward tilt below 1kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.|$|E

2500|$|<b>A-weighting</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used of a family of curves defined in the International standard IEC 61672:2003 and various national standards relating to the measurement of sound pressure level. <b>A-weighting</b> is applied to instrument-measured sound levels in an effort to account for the relative loudness perceived by the human ear, as the ear is less sensitive to low audio frequencies. [...] It is employed by arithmetically adding a table of values, listed by octave or third-octave bands, to the measured sound pressure levels in dB. The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) to provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound; the units are written as dB(A). [...] Other weighting sets of values - B, C, D [...] and now Z - are discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|The self-noise or {{equivalent}} input noise level {{is the sound}} level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does {{in the absence of}} sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in dB(A), which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: [...] "15dBA SPL" [...] (SPL means sound pressure level relative to 20micropascals). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11–14dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20dBA SPL or 32dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Brüel & Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from Neumann and Røde that advertise noise levels between 5–7dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the <b>A-weighting</b> curve while broadband noise may be increased.|$|E
