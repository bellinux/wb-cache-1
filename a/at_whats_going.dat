30|$|Although we’re looking holistically <b>at</b> <b>what’s</b> <b>going</b> on, {{sometimes}} you get just… you don’t see the family members and how they’re doing {{as much as we}} do [for] the client, as far as symptoms and stuff go. So it just helps you broaden your understanding of what the big picture is in the house.|$|R

500|$|During the Agents of Hydra pod in {{the fourth}} season, Collider.com's Evan Valentine noted how [...] "ne of the {{prevalent}} themes of this latter half of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s fourth season has been its jabs at the current Trump administration... When all’s said and done, whether you support or disavow the current administration and what it’s done with its time in office, does this commentary work here? Sure it does... We {{need to be able}} to laugh <b>at</b> <b>what’s</b> <b>going</b> on in the world, regardless of whether we agree or disagree, but S.H.I.E.L.D. has managed to throw in some biting commentary this season." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 28 November 2012, a 13-year-old {{girl was}} hit by a tram on the Bayles and Wylies {{footpath}} crossing, on the border of Bestwood and Hucknall. She was rushed to hospital but later died from her injuries. The local MP remarked [...] "I am mindful {{that this is not the}} first fatality on Nottingham's tramline and we obviously need to look <b>at</b> <b>what's</b> <b>going</b> wrong and how we can fix it." [...] The crossing was subsequently closed and both it, and the adjacent crossing that took the footpath across a nearby railway line, were replaced by a footbridge.|$|R
5000|$|Just as Simmons {{grew up with}} Watergate, GNP grew up with President Ronald Reagan, their {{favorite}} target for several years. [...] "But we make fun of liberals, too. It depends on who's in power." [...] The ability {{to adapt to a}} constantly changing world keeps GNP's revues up to the minute in content. For example: [...] "The LA situation cannot be ignored. Right now, right here, the entire focus of a political debate has shifted. We're in the center <b>at</b> <b>what's</b> <b>going</b> on. It's a tragedy, just like the Contra thing, but somehow it's government with their pants down, and they look foolish." ...|$|R

2500|$|After he {{got through}} that troubled phase of his career, he wrote [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] in Linda's honour.

Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't you help me understand...

5000|$|The {{antidote}} to both elation and laxity is awareness. We {{have to look}} <b>at</b> <b>what's</b> <b>going</b> on in our mind. Once awareness has told {{us that we are}} too loose or too tight, we {{have to learn how to}} adjust. If the obstacle is elation, we might try relaxing the technique, giving it a bit more room. We could give our outbreath more focus then our inbreath so that the mind has more freedom. ... If the obstacle is laxity, we need to tighten up our practice. We can bring more of our mind to the breathing overall. We could focus on the inbreath. We can stabilize our posture. We might try to perk up by removing a layer of clothing, opening a window, or raising our gaze.|$|R
500|$|McCartney {{suffered}} from depression prior to leaving {{the group and}} also after the group disbanded.

40|$|Objects take {{up space}} in memory. If your program creates lots of objects, throws them away, and creates more, you might {{eventually}} {{run out of}} memory. To reduce the chance that this will happen, Java has garbage collection. While the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs your program, it also spends little bits of time searching for objects that you’re no longer using, so it can reclaim their memory for use by other objects. You don’t have {{to know anything about}} garbage collection to be an effective Java programmer. But garbage collection is interesting because the JVM uses a lot of hidden data structures to manage memory. These data structures are hidden from your Java program [...] after all, the JVM, just like any other encapsulated module, should hide the details of how it is implemented. Here’s a peak <b>at</b> <b>what’s</b> <b>going</b> on under the hood. Roots and Reachability Garbage collection’s prime directive is to never sweep up an object your program might possibly use or inspect again. These objects are said to b...|$|R
