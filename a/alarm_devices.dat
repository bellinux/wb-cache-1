50|$|The {{enuresis}} alarm methodology {{originated from}} French and German physicians {{in the first}} decade of the 20th century.

Despite early success, the treatment was not developed until the 1930s by two independent groups of psychologists: Orval Mowrer and Willie Mae Mowrer (1938) and John Morgan and Frances Witmer (1939). Mowrer used a modified Pfaundler <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> with 30 children (ages 3-13 years) showing empirical success of the bell and pad method as a treatment for nocturnal enuresis, with the maximum time required to accomplish the treatment not exceeding two months.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of accidents is driver fatigue. To reduce the accidental rate, the driver needs a quick nap when feeling sleepy. Hence, searching for the minimum time period of nap is a very challenging problem. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold, i. e. to investigate the possible fastest time period for nap and its relationship with stage 2 sleep, and to develop an automatic stage 2 sleep detection and <b>alarm</b> <b>device.</b> The experiment for this investigation is designed with 21 subjects. It yields the result that waking up the subjects after getting into stage 2 sleep for 3 - 5 minutes can efficiently reduce the sleepiness. Furthermore, the automatic stage 2 sleep detection and <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> yields the real-time detection accuracy of approximately 85 % which is comparable with the commercial sleep lab system.

50|$|In Europe, between 1280 and 1320, {{there is}} an {{increase}} in the number of references to clocks and horologes in church records, and this probably indicates that a new type of clock mechanism had been devised. Existing clock mechanisms that used water power were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or <b>alarm</b> <b>devices.</b> This controlled release of power—the escapement—marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. Verge escapement mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.|$|E
5000|$|Yodalarm - These are {{the most}} used audible <b>alarm</b> <b>devices.</b> They are found at almost every MCB type {{crossing}} in Britain. Each alarm, at each crossing, has its own unique tone (usually a high pitch bleep, followed by a lower pitched bleep). The alarms have different volumes at different crossings, depending on how busy the crossing is, and whether residents are living nearby. The alarms sound for different durations at different types of crossings. Alarms sound from the activation of the crossing to when all barriers have fully lowered at MCB type crossings, alarms sound from the activation of the crossing to when the barriers raise at AHB (half barrier) type crossings and alarms sound for the whole time the crossing is active at non-barrier (AOCL) type crossings. At AHB and some AOCL crossings, {{the tone of the}} alarm often increases its speed, to alert pedestrians and drivers that a second train is approaching.|$|E
