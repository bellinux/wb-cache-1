25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E
500|$|On joining Walsall as a 19-year-old, Davis {{described}} himself as [...] "the type of player who likes to break things down <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call the 'nitty-gritty'. I like to get stuck in and work hard". He is primarily a defensive midfielder, reportedly priding himself on [...] "ball-winning ground-covering defensive midfield work"; his major contribution to his team comes from [...] "flying around midfield winning the ball and disrupting the opposition". Lee Clark suggested he looks best when using his power and strength and keeping {{his use of the}} ball simple. Dean Saunders mentioned his [...] "winning mentality"; according to the Birmingham Mail Brian Dick, [...] "when Blues are down no-one leads by example quite as much as Davis".|$|E
500|$|Romney {{is an avid}} equestrian, {{crediting}} her renewed {{involvement in}} it while in Park City, Utah (where the couple had built a vacation home and where they lived {{when he was in}} charge of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games), for much of her recovery after her multiple sclerosis diagnosis [...] and for her continued ability to deal with the disease. [...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided I needed to go back <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was as well to have two friends, instead of one; <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could to bind his wound up, and fasten his arm firmly to his side. Then I said to him: ...|$|R
60|$|KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment <b>I</b> erred <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on Constitution hill. I was {{confirmed}} by the bishop and enrolled in the brown scapular. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Can't Be Tamed"' was {{directed}} by Robert Hales. The dance routines were choreographed by Jamal Sims, who also choreographed Cyrus' [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". Cyrus and Sims conceived the plot for the video together and proposed it to Hales, who [...] "envisioned it the way [...] did". In regards to the video's theme, Cyrus explained, [...] "I think the video explains my life but it doesn't exclude other people's lives. It's not just about how fabulous and glamorous and all this. It's about the core of 'I don't wanna be in a cage. I want to be free <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> love'". The video was meant to transition Cyrus away from the good-girl image she had developed through Hannah Montana. However, she believed her fans {{would be able to}} identify with the video's message through their own circumstances; for example, she believed that her desire to [...] "stand out [...] than fit in" [...] was shared by teenagers hoping to break out of high school cliques. In an interview with the singer, Ryan Seacrest noted the video's strong sexual appeal. Cyrus agreed that the video was sexy, though it was not supposed to be the premise: [...] "The video isn't about being sexy or who can wear the less clothes [...] It's about explaining the song and living the lyrics." [...] The music video has been viewed over 100 million times on vevo.|$|E
2500|$|A {{severely}} burned body {{found inside}} Spengler's house {{is believed to}} be Spengler's 67-year-old sister Cheryl, with whom he was living. The shooting was suspected to have followed an argument between Spengler and Cheryl. A two-to-three-page typewritten letter written by Spengler was found at the scene. It reflected Spengler's intent to ambush first responders, but offered no motive for the shooting. In it, he wrote, [...] "I still have to get ready to see how much of the neighborhood I can burn down, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like doing best, killing people." ...|$|E
2500|$|When king Sigurd Ring {{saw this}} he {{encouraged}} his warriors {{and said that}} it was not possible that no one could defeat Ubbi. He then asked [...] "where is Starkad?". The old warrior answered [...] "it is difficult to win sire. However, I will do my best <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can, but Ubbi is a tough fighter". Starkad engaged with Ubbi and a fight began that was long and the most fierce of the entire battle. Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that no one had been closer to kill him before. The two champions were separated by the pushing throng of warriors, and Ubbi finally fell riddled with arrows from the archers of Telemark.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> {{more could}} <b>I</b> {{hope to do}} by prolonging the interview? I had succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew of Estella, <b>I</b> had said <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could to ease her mind. No matter with what other words we parted; we parted.|$|R
5000|$|For weeks, Lee {{attempted}} to countermand every desegregation order issued by Scott. Finally, Scott slapped contempt charges against Lee but revoked {{them in a}} bid to end the dispute over which school the girls would attend. According to the New York Times, Lee accused Scott of [...] "trying to blackmail me [...] [...] [...] I was a gentleman <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said I was going to <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> he backed out. He lied to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Studying at Denby High School, music became Shabazz’s {{salvation}} and escape from his problems at home. It {{was his way}} of venting. [...] "It gave me an outlet", he said. [...] "Because without that, I would have been out on the streets hustling, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> needed to <b>do</b> in order to survive".|$|R
2500|$|In {{celebration of}} Bulgari's 130th anniversary, Majida El Roumi {{has been named}} the first Middle East Humanitarian Ambassador of the Bulgari – Save the Children Partnership in July 2014 and joins the likes of Naomi Watts, Dita Von Teese, Meg Ryan, and Leighton Meester {{and so many others}} in the support of this worthy cause. The {{partnership}} between one of the industry’s leading jewelry houses and the world’s largest independent international organization running programs in developing and developed countries has generated over AED 98 million and benefited under-privileged children in 23 countries around the globe. [...] El Roumi is responsible for the overall direction, leadership, and coordination of Save the Children programs in Jordan as it was told in the press conference that took place at Al Bustan Hotel- Lebanon, {{in the presence of a}} crowd of Lebanese journalists and dignitaries. The renowned Spanish photographer Fabrizio Ferri has actively supported this initiative with his time and talent. Over the years, he has photographed over 200 celebrities wearing the ring and the pendant in support of Bvlgari’s commitment to quality schooling for the world’s neediest children including Majida, whose poster was officially launched during the press conference. Majida clearly stated during the press conference [...] "I will strive to bring joy to my surroundings and to the people who are in need of it. Everything that's happening is a crime in every meaning of the word. I feel that I have a mission and my appointment is for a cause that I truly believe in. I will travel the extra mile <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can regardless of the size of my mission." [...] She also [...] added, “There is no financial rewards for my participation in this humanitarian effort, as financial things do not bring happiness.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'll start to-morrow, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can. It's {{quite likely}} that before {{we put the}} thing through we'll have trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} the Supervisor would want me to camp here to-night <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could for you? If Norcross is badly injured you will need me." ...|$|E
60|$|My wrath arose. Had I {{travelled}} from Blois, <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{deemed the}} most honourable deed of my life, to be laughed at for my pains by a foppish young jackanapes of his Eminence's guards? Something of my displeasure must he have seen reflected on my face, for {{of a sudden}} he checked his mirth.|$|R
5000|$|It's my life <b>and</b> I'll <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want: It's my {{mind and}} I'll think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Most kids my age don't {{come across}} {{opportunities}} {{like the ones}} I've had[...] [...] ," [...] he also observed. [...] "I've experienced so many new things and met wonderful people along the way.

6000|$|... "You hear, de Mieville; {{bring the}} men on with all speed. I will gallop forward with my troopers <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can. Do I go {{straight}} along the road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want a servant. You do {{not seem}} to be strong enough for this work, but if you will be faithful, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell you, I will try you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the turtle}} {{said to the}} monkey, 'If you will be quiet, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell you, I won't hurt you. But you must get {{on my back and}} come with me.' ...|$|E
60|$|On my side, I {{could have}} cursed the {{kindness}} that conferred upon me this benefaction, but I kept my vexation {{under the surface}} for policy's sake, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could to let on to be glad. Indeed, I said I was glad. And {{in a way it}} was true; I was as glad as a person is when he is scalped.|$|R
6000|$|... "I just {{stuck on}} <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could with the stuff. I {{got a bit}} of money of my own--and I said to myself, 'Well, here you are with the gear and no one to look after you. You won't get such a chance again, my boy, not in all your born days. Why not make what you can with it? '" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what it is, my lad," [...] said the captain, [...] "my {{schooner}} is a trader or a man-of-war according to circumstances, and I'm a free man, going where <b>I</b> choose <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> please. I treat my men well when they do their duty; when they don't I make 'em walk the plank. No doubt you know what that means. If you don't we shall soon teach you. Take to-night to think over it. To-morrow morning I'll have a question or two to ask you. There--go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{moment he}} started on his drive, I hired a closed cab. [...] "Double your fare," [...] I {{said to the}} driver, [...] "whatever it may be, if you follow that chaise cleverly, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{table was}} empty now, {{and they were}} {{standing}} in comparative isolation looking into each other's eyes in silence. At last she murmured: [...] "You've helped me. I'm going to stay--a little while, anyway, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! very good. Now, take up {{the wires}} if you please, ma'am, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell you. Now, drop that stitch,--good; and take up this one,-- capital; and pull this one across that way,--so; and that one across this way,--exactly. Now, what is the result?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{rather a}} long story," [...] he began. [...] "I {{have been taken}} in, Midwinter. I've been imposed on by a person, who--I can't help saying it--who cheated me into {{promising}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> oughtn't to have promised, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had better not have done. It isn't breaking my promise to tell you. I can trust in your discretion, can't I? You will never say a word, will you?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> went below <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{could for}} my wound; it pained {{me a good}} deal and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it greatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as the ship was now, in a sense, my own, I {{began to think of}} {{clearing}} it from its last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel like}} one," [...] I said laughing; and I ran {{to my room}} <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had never <b>done</b> before--wrote a second poem in the same day. I had to have some outlet for my feelings. I called it [...] "In Summer Days of Long Ago," [...] and I worked Mary Gillespie's roses and Cecil Fenwick's eyes into it, and made it so sad and {{reminiscent}} and minor-musicky that I felt perfectly happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{take you}} in <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can for you," [...] said the general slowly. [...] "But look here, Smith, we must have discipline. I'm the general {{and you are the}} corporal; I am the master and you are the man. Now, don't let me have to remind you of that again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, trust me, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell you,' {{said the}} fox; 'I {{know it will}} bring you luck.' So the boy got up and picked some of the ripest pears {{and put them into}} a rush basket. The fox thanked him, and, taking the basket in his mouth, trotted off to the king's palace and made his way {{straight}} to the king.|$|E
60|$|I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I {{could see}} the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul {{appeared}} upon her decks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men were lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> chose with the ship.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>do</b> {{not deserve}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{am going to}} do for you," [...] he said. [...] "And Lutha deserves a better king than the one my act will give her; but I am neither a thief nor a murderer, and so I must forbear leaving you to your just deserts and return your throne to you.

6000|$|... "Don't be a fool," [...] Laverick said sternly. [...] "If you've {{anything}} {{on your mind}} apart from business, {{tell me about it}} <b>and</b> I'll <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can to help you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Olu Dara's cornet {{work was}} the first on-wax {{collaboration}} with his son.
