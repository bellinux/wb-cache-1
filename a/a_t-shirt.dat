5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach.

Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> and a backwards baseball cap.
