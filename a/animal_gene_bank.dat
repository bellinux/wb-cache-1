The aim of this study was to quantify the risk of losing diversity across the genome when targeting a single allele for conservation when storing <b>animals</b> in a <b>gene</b> <b>bank.</b> From a small Holstein population, genotyped for 54 001 SNP loci, animals were prioritized for a single allele while maximizing the genomewide diversity using optimal contribution selection. Selection for a single allele was done for five different target frequencies: (i) no restriction on a target frequency; (ii) target frequency = original frequency in population; (iii) target frequency = 0. 50; (iv) target frequency of the major allele = 1 (fixation); and (v) target frequency of the major allele = 0 (elimination). To do this, optimal contribution selection was extended with an extra constraint on the allele frequency of the target SNP marker. Results showed that elimination or fixation of alleles can result in substantial losses in genetic diversity around the targeted locus and also across the rest of the genome, depending on the allele frequency and the target frequency. It was concluded that losses of genetic diversity around the target allele are the largest when the target frequency is very different from the current allele frequency...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} in the 2 major cocoa producing areas (Southern and Western) of Cameroon to study the morphological diversity existing in cacao farms in relation to genetic diversity in <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> accessions. A total of 300 farm accessions (FA) were selected in the field which were compared to 77 <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> accessions distributed into 4 groups (AGs) according to their origin. The 17 quantitative and qualitative descriptors {{used in this study}} were related to leaf (flush colour), flower (ligule colour), pod (weight, length, width, apex form, shape, rugosity, colour, husk hardness, basal constriction and pod index) and seed (number, length, width, dry weight and colour) characters. For the qualitative characters evaluated, considerable morphological variation was observed using the Shannon Weaver diversity index (SWDI) within FA and <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> accessions. Among the FA, a differentiation between southern and western regions was only possible when using quantitative pod traits. Mean quantitative traits values of FA were not too different than those of most <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> AGs, except for a few traits of agronomical interest (seed weight and pod index). No significant variation was observed for seed traits in all FA groups (southern/western). The morphological structure (quantitative traits) showed spatial differentiation between western and southern FA and a closer relationship between <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> and some farm accessions. Furthermore, a molecular study done earlier using microsatellite profiles of the same FA did not show any genetic difference between FA of both regions, suggesting that the agro-morphological performance of FA is rather due to non-genetic factors. In contrast, microsatellites have shown that most of the <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> accessions were genetically distant from the FA, suggesting the low intake of some breeders' genotypes to farmers' fields.

40|$|Preserving genetic {{diversity}} Cue: The seeds {{of all the}} varieties of crops we have now are a massive and marvellous resource. They are a resource for plant breeders - {{who are trying to}} develop varieties with improved yields or better resistance to disease. And they are a resource for farmers - who may need rare or old varieties that may be, for example, better adapted to conditions brought about by climate change. One of the best living museums of seeds is a <b>gene</b> <b>bank.</b> Usually held by a research centre, inside there are millions of labelled containers of seeds. They are kept in perfect conditions to keep the seed alive and available to researchers or farmers that may want to use it. Crop scientist Sakile Kudita, from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), wants all farmers to know what <b>gene</b> <b>banks</b> are for. So Busani Bafana in Zimbabwe asked her to explain the benefits and what farmers can do to make sure this and future generations of farmers benefit from the riches provided by <b>gene</b> <b>banks.</b> IN:		?<b>Gene</b> <b>banks</b> preserve the value? OUT:		?in very small quantities. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 51 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Busani Bafana in Zimbabwe, speaking to Sakile Kudita. She says that preserving local seed varieties is important to save {{genetic diversity}}, but also to save local knowledge about those varieties. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Kudita 	<b>Gene</b> <b>banks</b> preserve the value and the diversity of a particular crop and that is why they are so important. So in other words we have this one crop for example sorghum which has several different types. In the <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> we take all those different types and put them in one house. We are trying to capture the entire gene pool of that particular crop. Bafana	For the benefit of farmers, why are <b>gene</b> <b>banks</b> necessary? Kudita 	<b>Gene</b> <b>banks</b> help breeders improve crops to benefit the farmers. It provides us with a source of material for breeders to pick up and improve that crop and then later on provide the same to the farmers ok. And the other thing about that is in a <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> we collect the crop from the whole world in other words. So we get farmers in one region benefiting from advances made by farmers in another region because we have got all the material, its diversity in one pot from which we can draw what is better and benefit the farmers that way. One other important thing about the <b>gene</b> <b>banks</b> is they preserve these things from extinction. When we have the weather extremes we may loose a lot of material. The influx of improved varieties makes it necessary to have a <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> because chances are everybody is going to grow the same thing, the newly-released variety and they stop growing the old one. But as you may notice eventually we may end up wanting that old one back. Bafana	What then {{is the role of the}} farmers in the establishment of a <b>gene</b> <b>bank?</b> Kudita 	You see when you put a particular seed of a particular type into the <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> you cannot just keep the seed there you need information about it. So that information comes from the indigenous people, we get it from the farmers themselves. This particular thing has this advantage it has good yields, it does not get damaged by weevils. That is the indigenous knowledge we are drawing. Bafana	What can you encourage the farmers to do in contributing to the establishment or even to the operation of a <b>gene</b> <b>bank?</b> Kudita 	When farmers donate material, that seed must be accompanied by adequate information about it. For that seed to be useful it must have information, where did you get it from? What is it about that you think we should know? Is it resistant to this disease? Does it store well? Has it got a good flavour? All that information must come with that seed. And if farmers also want something that they think we may have, I know farmers normally say we used to grow this, we do not know where it has gone to now. By chance it is here in the <b>gene</b> <b>bank.</b> You may come and if we have it we will be glad to provide although in very small quantities. End of track.

Design: A qualitative approach was adopted, using focus groups and interviews. Transcripts of audio recordings were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.

40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>banks</b> {{around the}} world hold over 370. 000 accessions of barley (van Hintum and Menting, 2003). Although {{a large number of}} landraces and {{obsolete}} cultivars are stored in genebanks the geographic coverage of this conserved material is far from evenly distributed. For example only a handful of landraces from Northern Europe have been conserved (Jones et al, 2008 a). Thus studies of geographic differences in land race barley are hampered by the availability of suitable material. Another major drawback with <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> material is the authenticity of the available accessions. Evolutionary forces such as drift and selection may have affected the genetic diversity since the accessions were deposited in <b>gene</b> <b>banks</b> and there is also a risk of contamination from poor propagation practices (Parzies et al., 2000).
