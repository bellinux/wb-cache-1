5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to show more respect for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vent.</b>|$|E
500|$|At 22:10 Atlantic Time (01:10 UTC), {{the flight}} crew {{detected}} an odour in the cockpit and determined it to be smoke from the air conditioning system. Following the captain's request, the crew turned off the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vent.</b> Four minutes later, the odour returned and the smoke became visible, prompting the pilots to make a [...] "pan-pan" [...] radio call to the air traffic control Moncton. ATC Moncton controls air traffic over the Province of Nova Scotia, including most flights en route to or from Europe. The pan-pan call {{indicated that there was}} an urgency due to smoke in the cockpit but did not declare an emergency as denoted by a [...] "Mayday" [...] call. The crew requested a diversion to Logan International Airport, Boston. They then accepted ATC Moncton's offer of a vector to the closer Halifax International Airport in Enfield, Nova Scotia, 66nm (104km) away rather than Boston, which was [...] further away.|$|E

He shows the note Aileen wrote to the police chief and {{explains}} that they were gone when he woke up that morning. Hoke tells the same basic story to his father later in the morning. That afternoon Hoke goes to the doctor to have his broken finger reset, explaining that he broke it while closing the door of his truck. On the way home, he realizes that there is no <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vent</b> in the closet, so he gets four fifty-pound blocks of ice and moves the corpses into the shower stall with the ice.

50|$|Later that evening, several Jamaican cartel members {{enter the}} Colombian drug lord's penthouse. After they ritualistically murder him, they are {{slaughtered}} by the Predator. Harrigan's team enter the penthouse where {{they find the}} Jamaicans' skinned corpses suspended from the rafters, noting the similarity to the earlier Colombian massacre. Keyes arrives and kicks Harrigan's team out. Archuleta later returns to continue investigating. After he finds one of the Predator's speartip weapons in an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vent,</b> the lurking Predator kills him. Harrigan vows to bring down Danny's killer, believing {{they are dealing with}} an assassin. Forensic analysis reveals the speartip is not composed of any known element on the periodic table. Seeking answers, Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie, a voodoo practitioner, in an alley. King Willie tells Harrigan that the killer is supernatural, and that he should prepare himself for battle against him. Harrigan, even more puzzled, leaves before the Predator kills King Willie, taking his head as a trophy. For Harrigan's persistence, the Predator begins to mark him as his ultimate hunting challenge.|$|E
5000|$|The aim of {{cleanroom}} suitability {{tests is}} to determine the suitability of machines and operating utilities (<b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> <b>venting,</b> etc.) for use in cleanrooms. The tests must be carried out using measurement techniques as particle emission behavior cannot be adequately assessed by the naked eye or similar means. No metrological tests are required if there are obvious flaws in machines and operating utilities, such as rust or the presence of porous or completely unsuitable materials (wood, etc.).|$|R

5000|$|The Executive Sedan was, simply, a {{stretched}} LeBaron {{that held}} a center console between the front seats. The console held duct {{work for the}} two rear seat <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vents.</b> The Executive Limousine (option code A-89) had a thick center divide behind the front seats that held a glass divider with power sliding center panel (controlled from the passenger-side switch panel), two upholstered jump seats (without seat belts), five <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vents</b> (with flow controlled by a switch on the rear passenger-side door), an illuminated storage compartment with a flip-down door, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette (separate from the driver's sound system) controlling the four rear speakers. Above the divider glass was a [...] "glamour module" [...] lighting unit - with overhead lights for the console, {{as well as individual}} reading lamps for the two jump seats. Once the rear doors were closed, the lamps located in this overhead console would slowly theatre-dim before turning off. Executive Sedans had a similar lighting feature, {{in the form of a}} small single lamp located above each rear door. Both Sedan and Limousine models had adjustable rear-seat headrests, two-position foot rests, rear quarter reading lamps, and pillar mounted assist straps.|$|R
5000|$|Notwithstanding the navy's oft-stated {{position}} that {{a collision with}} a foreign vessel had triggered the event, a report issued by the government attributed the disaster to a torpedo explosion caused when high-test peroxide (HTP), a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide, leaked from a faulty weld in the torpedo's casing. The report found that the initial explosion destroyed the torpedo room compartment and killed everyone in the first compartment. The blast entered the second and perhaps {{the third and fourth}} compartments through an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vent.</b> All of the 36 men in the command post located in the second compartment were immediately incapacitated by the blast wave and possibly killed. [...] The first explosion caused a fire that raised the temperature of the compartment to more than 2700 C. The heat triggered the warheads of between five and seven additional torpedoes to detonate, creating an explosion equivalent to 2-3 tons of TNT that was measured 4.2 on the Richter magnitude scale on seismographs across Europe and was detected as far away as Alaska.|$|E
5000|$|Pancho Morris as Josh Morgan, an {{eccentric}} drama student and Mike's roommate. Josh {{was raised in}} Russia, though little else is known about his background. In the episode [...] "Parents' Weekend", he attempts to fake his own parents' visit, hiring an actress to play his mother and paying his dad {{to take part in}} their [...] "scenes." [...] He {{is best known for his}} bizarre behavior, which includes pretending to commit seppuku with a marker, sneaking around the floor wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, walking around completely naked, eating Mike's deodorant, and storing his food in his <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vent</b> since he doesn't own a refrigerator. In [...] "Come (Out) Today", Josh performs his self-discovery play, and the floor is very impressed with his theatrical talent. In the episode [...] "A Capella", Josh began working on his very own 5-South documentary film, which very rapidly devolves into a gross overdramatization of his floormates, particularly Mike. In [...] "Blood, Sweat, and Tears" [...] his docu-drama titled [...] "Return To Dormalcy" [...] is screened by his floormates and is greeted with a poor response, as nearly everyone is either drowsy or offended. He often attempts to come up with his own pranks and games like Mike does, but they are poorly-conceived and often backfire on him. In [...] "Floor Dinner", Josh switched places with a homeless woman named Linda to do a performance piece underneath the Lincoln Bridge. He lives there with a homeless man named Hampton. Josh returns to 5-South in [...] "Dormal" [...] because he realizes that he needs his friends. During Dormal, there is footage of Josh making up with Mike.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn thermal {{environment}} where occupants stopover, the air supply jet easily dynamical changes due to some cross-flow interferences, influencing the dynamic human thermal comfort. RWI and PD are {{selected as the}} human dynamic thermal comfort indexes here. Based on the theory analysis on RWI and PD, the supply air temperature can be increased by improving the velocity in some extends. This will bring obvious energy saving of the air conditioning system. For example, based on RWI and PD within dynamic thermal comfort range, the supply air temperature could be 32 °C with air velocity between 0. 6 - 4 m/s. Experimental studies on the RWI and PD characteristics beneath the vent are developed, affected by the unstable cross-flow. According to the experimental results of typical testing points under the vent in vertical direction and horizontal direction at 1. 5 m height, the values of RWI and PD {{are close to the}} comfort zone coupling with the dynamic cross-flow and the dynamic thermal comfort below the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vent</b> is improved...|$|E
50|$|Though {{the walls}} of Stamford House were in a good condition, 50% of the {{plasterwork}} and cornices were damaged. Most of the wooden floor boards in the building were rotten {{and had to be}} replaced with chengai (Balanscarpus heimii), a tropical hardwood. New doors in the original style had to be made. All originals were photographed meticulously before work began. Modern services had to be added sensitively, so that wiring and the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vents</b> do not jar with the original architecture.|$|R

50|$|A halo {{ground is}} a type of ring ground that, instead of being {{installed}} outside and underground, is installed inside, near the top of a building or structure. The ground reference for all equipment inside the area being protected is separate from the halo. The halo is connected to the main building ground, which may include an underground ring ground outside the building, with vertical conductors especially in the corners of the building. Electrical equipment is also often placed in fully enclosed metal cabinets, which function as Faraday cages to further protect the equipment. The halo may be connected to structural metallic elements such as door frames, building steel, window frames, and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vents.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{place of}} the building, there was {{formerly}} the square itself, meaning mostly empty space consisting of a busy bus stop. In {{the upper part of}} the space, there was the entrance to the pedestrian underpass and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vents</b> blowing hot <b>air</b> in the winter, allowing for people to get some warmth when waiting for their evening or night buses. The area also contained benches to sit while waiting for the bus and constituted a logical ending of the square from its side. Because of this structure, the bus stop shrunk several times and it is now prone to draft, as cold wind sometimes blows through the narrow passages of the Astoria Palace ground floor.|$|R
5000|$|Custom: Base model, usually {{equipped}} with manual locks/windows, color-keyed vinyl seat and dashboard, and black rubber floor mat. However, a Custom trim truck could still {{share some of}} the same options as the higher-trim trucks. A steering wheel cover and Ford logo above the radio was optional. Chrome door handles outside the cab to hoist the driver up and into the cab were also optional. On trucks without <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> <b>vents</b> were not installed into the dashboard, giving the driver only two choices for air direction: [...] "Defrost" [...] and [...] "Heat", with [...] "Heat" [...] on a non-A/C truck being the equivalent of [...] "Floor" [...] on a truck with A/C. The lack of vents on the dashboard does have an advantage, as it leaves room for the installation of aftermarket gauges.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle's <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{could be}} {{adjusted}} by an infrared remote controlled hand held unit {{from the rear}} seat, located in a separate compartment attached {{on top of the}} rear armrest at the front. Separate <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and heating <b>vents</b> were provided for rear seat passengers.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{included some}} unique {{features such as}} the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vents</b> which are flush-fitting in the dash, rotating open once the engine is started, and a rotating gearshift dial called the JaguarDrive Selector which rises out of the centre console. Another departure from the traditional Jaguar cabin ambiance {{is the use of}} pale-blue backlighting to the instruments, switchgear, and around major control panels. Some minor systems, such as the interior lighting, are controlled simply by touching the light covers. The glove compartment also opens to the touch. Unusually the XF has no cloth interior option, with even the entry level model being fully trimmed in leather - even areas that have employed plastic on previous Jaguars. Real wood veneers are available, but have been joined by aluminium, carbon fibre and piano black lacquer trims to create a modern look to the passenger compartment.|$|R
50|$|The Purple Room {{had a more}} gentle ambience; {{however, the}} ceiling was also a {{significant}} feature. The ceiling was vaulted with floating, sprayed vermiculite, square panels over concealed purple lighting, translucent purple resin light boxes and square <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>vents</b> arranged in an irregular pattern. Carpet of the same design as the Blue Room but in shades of purple and mauve {{was used in the}} front half of the auditorium; however later the foyer carpet was used in the stairs and passageways. A purple version of the foyer carpet was in the back section. The Purple Room had the same seating configuration as the Blue Room but with a smaller number of seats. Seats were upholstered in purple vinyl and the walls are covered with purple wool drapes. Timber detailing was the same as Cinema One and also included an usher's seat. Wall lighting was concealed under pelmets {{at the top of the}} walls. A fire escape stair was located to the right of the screen.|$|R
