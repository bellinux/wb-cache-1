5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out of the genesis and character of growth dislocations present in all growth sectors of single crystals of potash alum. The crystals, grown from seeded solutions by the temperature lowering method under conditions of low supersaturation, presented the well-developed forms: { 111 } dominant, { 100 } and { 110 }. Growth dislocations formed predominately during refacetting of the edges and corners of the seed, rounded during preparation and insertion into the supersaturated solution. From here they become refracted into the { 111 } sectors which proved to be the most defective. Smaller numbers of dislocations form at the { 111 }, { 100 } and { 110 } seed interfaces and propagate in these sectors. In crystals of inferior quality, a number of inclusions were found predominantly in the fast growing { 100 } sectors which become the source of additional dislocations. Dislocations present in the original seed did not propagate across the interface into the developing crystal. Dislocations of all characters were observed. The principal Burgers vectors were found to be left <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> 100 right-pointing <b>angle</b> <b>bracket,</b> left <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> 110 right-pointing <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> and left <b>angle</b> <b>bracket</b> 111 right-pointing <b>angle</b> <b>bracket...</b>|$|R
