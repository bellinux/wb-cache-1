5|$|After suppressing a minor {{rebellion}} in Wales in 1276–77, Edward {{responded to a}} second {{rebellion in}} 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, Edward subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. In the war that followed, the Scots persevered, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. At {{the same time there}} were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son, EdwardII, an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of civil society}} organizations flourished even more in the 1990s, {{due in part to}} King Hassan II’s active support for them, which reflected a worldwide trend of civil society promotion.

All of Morocco’s major women’s organizations have positioned their work within an Islamic framework in some way, drawing on the work of Islamic scholars to inform their agendas.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, Germany planned three {{different}} VTOL aircraft. One used the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter {{as a basis}} for research for a V/STOL aircraft.

25|$|Crawford's {{first play}} to be {{performed}} by a New Theatre group was Welcome Home by the Melbourne branch in 1946. The views held on social <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>problems</b> by the New Theatre group aligned with Crawford's. Some the topics covered by other New Theatre writers included racial discrimination, war and peace, unemployment and other social problems. Some themes of Crawford's plays include the impact of military armament testing on Aboriginal society (Rocket Range), post war housing shortages (Welcome Home) and political commentary plays (Frame Up) {{just to name a}} few. Many plays were written to be entered into competitions on behalf of the New Theatre club. Crawford continued working with the New Theatre group for many years and wrote many plays that were performed by them.|$|E
25|$|The essay, {{written in}} harsh tones, listed what Caragiale {{saw as the}} major social {{problems}} tolerated by Romanian administrations: he discussed the landowning class, successor to the boyars, having maintained as much possible from the legacy of serfdom; he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic oligarchy and its far-reaching political machine. As several commentators noted, many of the topics brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by Junimea. To the social <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>problems,</b> the text offered a monarchist solution—Caragiale expected Carol I {{to carry out a}} coup d'état against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the Constitution of 1866, which left some room for privilege through the census suffrage, with a more democratic one.|$|E
25|$|A second {{challenge}} was organizational. Feldman pushed for and won convention {{approval for the}} addition of {{an executive vice president}} for the AFT, the first new executive officer {{to be added to the}} union's governing structure in its history. Nat LaCour, president of the United Teachers of New Orleans, was elected to the position. But Feldman was unable to overcome all the union's organizational <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>problems.</b> In late July 1998, about 3,500 members of the AFT's health care division, almost all of them in Rhode Island, disaffiliated due to a disagreement about the union's willingness to spend money organizing new members. The health care workers subsequently formed an independent union, the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, and later raided several AFT health care locals in Rhode Island and Vermont.|$|E

The financial <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>problems</b> of the recent Australian tour led them to begin negotiations with Packer for a WSC series in the Caribbean during the spring of 1979. Initially, Pakistan took a hard line and refused to select their Packer players, but when WSC signed additional Pakistanis during the off season, and when an under-strength official Pakistan team were easily beaten by England in the three Test series in the English Summer of 1978, they took a more pragmatic approach, so it when it came time in October 1978 for the First Test Series between Pakistan and India for seventeen years all the Packer players were included. Ostensibly, India were not involved as yet, but rumours abounded that their captain Bishan Bedi and star batsman Sunil Gavaskar had signed WSC options.|$|E
25|$|Some years later, after Easton became President of the American Political Science Association, he led {{the charge}} of a new post-behavioralist revolution, arguing that {{political}} science research should be both relevant and action-oriented, so it might better {{serve the needs of}} society by solving social <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>problems</b> revealed during the 1960s. This new revolution was not a change in the methods of inquiry but a change in orientation that grew out of a deep discontent with the direction of contemporary political research and which advocated more attention to the public responsibilities of the discipline and to relevant research on contemporary political problems and issues. According to John Gunnell, this was the official birth announcement of the public policy enterprise in political science which became the basis of the self-image of orthodox political science in the 1970s. With this shift came a distinct de-emphasis of concern for establishing a general unified theory as the core of the discipline, and a retreat from any pointed confrontation with the history of political theory.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation {{started a}} program to {{eradicate}} hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything. This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated {{that there was a}} crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico. The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get a foot in the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>problems</b> on many levels.|$|E
