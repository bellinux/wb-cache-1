40|$|Students new {{to family}} law {{are likely to}} find that a {{significant}} portion of the syllabus focuses on the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA). Part I is primarily concerned with divorce and nullity and Part II with financial provision on breakdown of a marriage 1 and it is the latter which this article will consider. By way of overview for students new to the subject the law does not normally intervene in respect of how money and property are distributed amongst family members. Ownership of family property is largely governed by the law of property and equity and trust. However, following divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership the courts may split assets according to what is fair between the parties having regard to the individual needs and circumstances of the parties and any children. This can include an order for a lump sum or periodical payments 2; a property <b>adjustment</b> <b>order</b> or order for sale 3 and orders relating to pension provision 4 with section 25 setting out what the court must take into account in deciding whether to exercise its powers in respect of those provisions. This area of family law has recently received considerable coverage in the legal press following the unanimous Supreme Court decision in Wyatt v Vince 5 to allow the appellant wife’s appeal against the striking out of her claim for financial relief 18 years after the grant of the decree absolute and direct that her application proceed to the High Court Family Division. This article will not focus on the procedural aspects of this decision other than to highlight that Lord Wilson, delivering the judgement, made it clear that Rule 4. 4 of the Family Procedure Rules does not confer on the family court the power of summary judgement equivalent to that found in the Civil Procedure Rules. Instead when a former spouse applies for a financial order, the court has a duty under section 25 (1) of the MCA to consider all the circumstances of the case including the eight areas set out in subsection 2...|$|E

50|$|The courts powers derive {{in large}} part from the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, and in {{particular}} section 25(2) which sets out the statutory checklist of factors that {{should be taken into}} account. The court can order lump sum payments, property <b>adjustment</b> <b>orders</b> (e.g. requiring a property is transferred into the ownership of a husband or wife), periodical payments (known as 'maintenance') and (from 2000) pension sharing orders.|$|R

Initially under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989, and subsequently under the Family Law Act 1995 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, courts are empowered to make a wide range of ancillary property orders on judicial separation and divorce. These include orders for the sale or transfer of property, periodical payment orders, lump sum <b>orders,</b> pension <b>adjustment</b> <b>orders</b> and financial compensation orders...|$|R

30|$|The {{economic}} dispatch of microgrid {{is usually}} constructed as a nonlinear programming problem. Existing methods concerning this {{problem can be}} categorized into two aspects, the centralized method and the decentralized method. With regard to the former, the microgrid central controller (MGCC) is responsible for a coordinated decision making process to balance supply and demand of all units in the system. Mathematical methods, including sequential quadratic programming [2], interior-point algorithm [3], mixed integer programming [4], and heuristic-based intelligent algorithms, like generic algorithm [5] and particle swarm optimization [6] are mostly common seen in this respect. To overcome model complexity and the low computation efficiency of the centralized method, decentralized method treats each unit as an autonomous agent with their own operation goals. MGCC then gathers all the self-scheduling information and gives <b>adjustment</b> <b>orders</b> based on system-wide economy and reliability [7, 8]. Furthermore, privacy of different DER entities can be well protected via this distributed manner.|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) by sulfate radical generated via Co(II) -mediated activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) was examined. The influencing factors, such as substrate concentration and pH were investigated. The initial pH and its <b>adjustment</b> <b>orders</b> significantly affected the TCP degradation and mineralization. Several chlorinated products were detected, {{as well as}} some carboxylic acids, such as glycolic acid and oxalic acid. Many polychlorinated (chlorine atom number ⩾ 3) aromatics (e. g. 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol, 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetrachlorophenol, 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzenediol) and even their ring-opening products (e. g. 2, 4 -dichloro- 5 -oxo- 2 -hexenedioic acid, 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetrachloro- 2 -propanone) were identified, indicating a de novo formation mechanism of organohalogens may be involved in TCP degradation. The released chlorine atoms from TCP and/or dichloride radicals activated by sulfate radicals played an important role. This finding may have significant scientific and technical implications for utilizing Co/PMS reagent to detoxify chlorinated pollutants...|$|R

40|$|By {{utilizing}} the 2008 Athens Area Study (AAS) data set, this study investigates four aspects {{of job satisfaction}} – total pay, promotion prospects, respect received from one’s supervisor, and total job satisfaction – between healthy and heath-impaired employees. Health impaired employees {{are found to be}} less satisfied according to all job satisfaction measures even when a large number of productivity features, and job characteristics are controlled for. The outcomes suggest also that women are more satisfied with their jobs than men are, regardless of health status. Moreover, the estimations show that health impaired employees' job satisfaction is affected more than healthy employees' job satisfaction by adverse mental health symptoms (life dissatisfaction). Finally, health impaired employees are found to become more satisfied with their jobs with time after disability onset. The study concludes that health impaired employees may have higher expectations about what they will obtain from their work, and that they may have job satisfaction <b>adjustments.</b> <b>ordered</b> probit model, job satisfaction, health impairments, two-step quasi-likelihood exogeneity test, switching regression model...|$|R
