40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the paper}} is to compare the design of {{direct-drive}} permanent-magnet (PM) generators associated with horizontal axis tidal turbines. The turbine/generator couplings are examined. These turbine/generator couplings consist of a POD and Rim-driven assembly. In a Rim-Driven association the electrical generator <b>active</b> <b>parts</b> are inserted in a duct surrounding the blades. For POD generator insertion, the electrical machine is placed in a nacelle located on the turbine axis. To achieve the generators sizing, a design rated point related to an industrial MCT is defined. The used design models include an electromagnetic model which is linked to a thermal model in an optimization procedure that goals to minimize the <b>active</b> <b>parts</b> cost. Firstly, a single rotor/single stator PM axial flux generator and a radial flux PM generator are designed for a rim-driven MCT specification. For these generators sizing, {{a comparison of the}} machines <b>active</b> <b>parts</b> and the machines geometrical dimensions are carried out. Secondly, radial flux PM generators are designed for Rim-Driven and POD assembly and a comparison is performed for this study case. Finally, the influence of the POD diameter on the generator electromagnetic design is studied. It shows that the <b>active</b> <b>parts</b> costs are minimized, when the generator diameter is around 1 / 3 of the turbine diameter for the considered specifications. These performed comparisons between the considered study cases aims to help designers in their technologies choices...|$|R

5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more <b>active</b> <b>part</b> in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
