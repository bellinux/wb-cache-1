5|$|Brotherhood {{was made}} {{as part of}} a planned {{multimedia}} expansion of Final Fantasy XV without the need to develop a series of games. The series was conceived by Ofuji in 2014, based on his wish to expand upon an in-game reference to the difficult childhood of one of the characters. The story focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and was designed to give players glimpses into the personal lives <b>and</b> <b>personalities</b> of the characters that would not have fitted within the game.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{proponent of}} the day fighter force and the defence of Germany, Galland used his {{position}} to improve {{the position of the}} Jagdwaffe. The need was now pressing, as Germany had declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, and Galland was keen to build up a force that could withstand the resurgence of the Western Allied Air Forces in preparation for what would become known as the Defence of the Reich campaign. Galland was outspoken, something that was not often tolerated by Göring. Yet, by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe, like Erhard Milch and Günther Korten, <b>and</b> <b>personalities</b> in the industrial sector such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler, Galland was able to survive in his position for three years.|$|E

40|$|The major {{questions}} when considering substance abuse/dependence <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> are how these two constructs are related {{and how they}} interact. A review of the prevalence literature since 1986 documenting the co-occurrence of substance abuse disorders <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> disorders is presented in this study.

5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes <b>and</b> <b>personalities.</b> The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} <b>and</b> <b>personalities</b> {{featured in}} the game directly correspond to real life venues and people—for example, blogger Brian Pigeon is mentioned {{as one of the}} Hatoful world's most influential writers, and the aforementioned Torimi Café, featured in-game as a location where the protagonist can work during summer vacation, is an actual bird-themed café located in Kobe. Likewise, some aspects of Hatofuls narrative reference real world events, media, or people: the deadly H5N1 pandemic forming the basis of the game's post-apocalyptic setting was inspired by historical outbreaks of disease, most prominently the 1918 flu pandemic; depictions of Hitchcock's Winter, the in-universe war between humans and birds, bear several similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds; and Operation Carneades—the codename given to the human countermeasure against H5N1 that instead granted intelligence to birds in the Hatoful universe—was named after Greek philosopher Carneades and one of his thought experiments, the Plank of Carneades.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting of}} the main series is a Northern European-style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from myth and legends live side by side, while the {{spin-off}} game is set in an alternative reality leading {{from one of the}} first game's possible endings. The stories generally focus on the fortunes <b>and</b> <b>personalities</b> {{of a small group of}} protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story. Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a staple of the series. Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptions and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga.|$|E

5|$|As ADC, Abu Nuwar {{was a major}} {{influence}} over then-20 year old Hussein and was constantly at his side, advising Hussein to dismiss Glubb and sever ties with the British. Hussein was also influenced by other Arab nationalist officers <b>and</b> <b>personalities,</b> including his cousin Zaid ibn Shaker, and the increasingly anti-imperialist and Arab nationalist political atmosphere in the country. As a sign of his increasing nationalism and {{as a means to}} quiet political opposition to his rule, Hussein decided to dismiss Glubb. He coordinated with Abu Nuwar and other Free Officers to ensure that his impending dismissal of Glubb would not result in a revolt by the latter's supporters within the Arab Legion. Thus, on 28 February 1956, Abu Nuwar was instructed to ready his troops, and he subsequently posted Free Officers at the Amman Airport, the major army base at Zarqa and in the vicinity of Glubb Pasha's Amman residence. After Abu Nuwar's positions were confirmed to him, Hussein conferred with his cabinet and dismissed Glubb on 1 March. Glubb complied with the order and departed Jordan the following day. Hussein then promoted Abu Nuwar to major-colonel and appointed Major General Radi Annab to Glubb's former position as {{chief of staff of the}} Arab Legion, which was concurrently renamed the Jordanian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chicago {{experienced}} {{two major}} race riots. Triggered by Civil Rights struggles and angst, more riots followed {{in subsequent years}} and the Black Power movement came into fruition. Artists began to explore ways to express black pride, self-determination and self-reliance leading in 1966 to the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC). Artist Norman Parish asked Jarrell to attend a meeting for OBAC's Artists' Workshop. The meetings would consist of artists bringing their work to be critiqued and reflect on ideas of the black experience in art, leading to the concept behind Wall of Respect. The mural consisted of African American heroes <b>and</b> <b>personalities,</b> each artist deciding who should be depicted in their section. Sylvia Abernathy designed the layout, giving Jarrell a 12 × 14 foot space to share with photographer Bill Abernathy. Jarrell focused on a favorite theme, rhythm and blues, and featured portrayals of James Brown, B.B. King, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington. The Artists' Workshop would sour {{towards the end of}} the project: there were controversies stemming from the painting in Norman Parish's section, conflicts regarding copyrights being sold without permission, disagreements on law enforcement involvement, as well as deceit. Nevertheless the Wall was considered a success, triggering the creation of liberation themed murals in Chicago and beyond.|$|E
5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, <b>and</b> <b>personalities</b> were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organization; their manuscript thickness is 15cm.|$|E

30|$|Designing {{effective}} {{educational programs}} to reduce dropout in higher and vocational education requires {{thorough understanding of}} the underlying mechanisms of study success. This study examines if first-year dropout is associated with cognitive ability <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> traits as measured by a formative entry test just before enrollment in Dutch vocational education. The {{results show that the}} formative entry test outcomes do not properly identify students at risk, the association between first-year dropout and, respectively, cognitive skills <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> traits is generally not significant. Consequently, and of importance for both students and vocational education institutes, students cannot be properly informed about whether their skills <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> traits match the required skills <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> traits of the program.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} has predominantly {{focused on a}} limited range of childhood events <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> disorders, such as childhood maltreatment <b>and</b> borderline <b>personality</b> disorder. Moreover, researchers rarely account for multiple risk factors within the same study, despite the reality that childhood events do not occur in isolation. Therefore, the current research aims {{to contribute to the}} knowledge on childhood events <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> disorder symptoms by investigating a wider range of risk and protective factors in a community-based sample. The first study was a survey that identified common positive childhood events for inclusion in a new childhood events checklist that was designed to assess a wider range of both positive and negative childhood events. Study Two used latent class analysis to profile the childhood events <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> disorder symptoms. Study Three provided an examination of the association between the latent classes of negative childhood events, positive childhood events <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> disorder symptoms. Study Four provided a more in-depth understanding into the factors underpinning the relationships between childhood events <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> disorder symptoms from a qualitative perspective...|$|R
5|$|On January 5, 1989, {{production}} {{began on}} {{a new version of}} Super Sloppy Double Dare from Philadelphia at WHYY-TV, continuing in syndication. The series premiered on January 22, 1989. The second half of the series was produced at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, with production beginning in April 1989. This version of the show recorded in larger studios with a larger set allowed for a lower level devoted to physical challenges and obstacles with a bigger size and, typically, bigger messes. Many episodes {{in this part of the}} series featured unique and offbeat themes that questions, challenges, and sometimes wardrobe would be patterned after. Themes included a Salute to Baseball, Backwards Day, Stupid Hat Day, a Salute to Breakfast, and two Super-Slop-a-Mania episodes featuring wrestlers <b>and</b> <b>personalities</b> from the World Wrestling Federation. Another special episode saw Summers and Harvey each team with a contestant to compete against each other, with Jim J. Bullock taking over hosting duties. By the end of Super Sloppy Double Dare, the program was syndicated to 154 stations. The series left syndication on September 8, 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits <b>and</b> <b>personalities</b> were modified due to different backstories.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between self-leadership <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> through an analysis and comparison of hierarchical factor structures. More specifically, this {{study examined}} the relationships between the self-leadership dimensions of behavior-focused strategies, natural reward strategies, and constructive thought strategies, <b>and</b> the <b>personality</b> dimensions of extraversion, emotional stability, and conscientiousness. The results of the study provide evidence that the self-leadership dimensions are distinct from, yet related to, the specified personality traits. The hypothesis that self-leadership strategies are distinct from the selected personality traits was supported through structural equations modeling analyses examining competing models combining the hierarchical factor structures of self-leadership <b>and</b> <b>personality.</b> Model fit increased significantly through a progression of models that showed increasingly greater distinction between self-leadership dimensions <b>and</b> <b>personality</b> traits. The best fitting model in the progression, in harmony with both self-leadership <b>and</b> trait <b>personality</b> theory, consisted of a hierarchical factor structure with three first order self-leadership factors, three first order <b>personality</b> factors, <b>and</b> two correlated second order factors (i. e., self-leadership <b>and</b> <b>personality)</b> ...|$|R
