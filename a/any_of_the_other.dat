5|$|As coal was {{extremely}} expensive on the West Coast of the Americas, HMS Zealous generally used her sails and covered more miles under sail than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Victorian sailing ironclads, {{and in her}} whole career never once travelled in company with another ironclad. She {{was also the first}} British ironclad to sail further from Britain than the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|Albert is a nerd. Way more {{intellectual}} than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> lover <b>of</b> {{poetry and}} art. People {{tend to make}} fun of him because he's a little feeble and quite eccentric in his tastes.|$|R
25|$|I {{mention the}} names because the halakhic process {{operates}} with {{a hierarchy of}} authority and influence.

25|$|Abu Bakr {{was fully}} aware of Umar's power and ability to succeed him.

5|$|Bell's retrial in the Barker {{assault was}} {{scheduled}} for December 6. Three days before the trial began, {{he pleaded guilty to}} a reduced charge of battery, and was sentenced to 18months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed to testify against <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> assault defendants at trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the plea agreement.|$|E
5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined about <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> homicides, and only became interested in this one {{when it became clear}} that one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cards. Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit the card for a water test, using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity. The card broke apart, and as a result, the card was dismissed as a fake.|$|E

50|$|Another {{game with}} the same title was also {{released}} on the Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, GameCube, PC, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation Portable, though this version is vastly different from <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> released and a 2.5-D side-scrolling beat-'em-up game involving no three-dimensional gameplay.|$|R
2500|$|Heinlein {{credited}} him {{for being}} his main influence: [...] "I have learned from many writers—from Verne and Wells and Campbell and Sinclair Lewis, et al.—but I have learned more from you than from <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> and perhaps more than for all <b>the</b> <b>others</b> put together …" ...|$|R
5|$|In 2008 the {{newspaper}} The Guardian named Myrrha's {{relationship with her}} father as depicted in Metamorphoses by Ovid {{as one of the}} top ten stories of incestuous love ever.

5|$|O'Brien {{was also}} {{equipped}} with four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy {{had called for}} two anti-aircraft guns for the O'Brien-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for O'Brien or <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ships of the class.|$|E
5|$|Recurrent {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{may result}} from intrinsic muscle enzyme deficiencies, which are usually inherited and often appear during childhood. Many structural muscle diseases feature episodes of rhabdomyolysis that are triggered by exercise, general anesthesia or <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> causes of rhabdomyolysis listed above. Inherited muscle disorders and infections together cause the majority of rhabdomyolysis in children.|$|E
50|$|Each squad member {{commands}} the same abilities as <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> such as <b>the</b> ability to walk, swim, pilot vehicles and fire multiple weapons but the primary squad member {{is the only}} squadie that can also climb certain surfaces. This ability makes him crucial to success on certain missions.|$|R
30|$|Amongst the {{remaining}} methods, none was clearly superior to <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> For overall mortality the best method, {{by a small}} margin, was Broad Age SMR Scaling, followed closely by several other methods. For mortality age profiles, the best, again by small margins, were the Mortality Surface and Brass Relational methods.|$|R
25|$|Article II <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{constitution}} {{states that}} there are to be three separate branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. It also explicitly states that no one from one is to exercise rights belonging to <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> something considered implicit in the federal constitution or inferred by its interpreters (Sections 1 and 2).|$|R
5|$|The total costs, {{including}} all alterations, were £513,242 for Glatton and £777,197 for Gorgon, {{although there was}} no obvious reason for the disparity unless some of Glatton's costs had been charged against Gorgon as the lead ship of the class. A truer cost would be about £645,000 for each. This was almost double the original cost and made them more expensive than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> monitors.|$|E
5|$|After a quick {{visit to}} Venezuela and Panama, in April 1948 Castro {{traveled}} {{to the city of}} Bogotá, Colombia where the Pan-American Conference was taking place. Fidel's Cuban student group along with others attempted to organize the 1948 Pan-American Students Conference in opposition, sponsored by the government of Argentine President Juan Perón. Instead the assassination of popular leftist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala led to widespread rioting that {{came to be known as}} the Bogotazo. Leaving 3000 dead, the riots revolved around clashes between the governing Conservatives – backed by the army – and leftist Liberals with support from socialists. Along with his fellow Cuban visitors, Castro joined the Liberal cause by stealing guns from a police station, but subsequent police investigations concluded that neither Castro nor <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Cubans had been involved in the killings.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple and {{efficient}} iterative method of synthesis for reconfigurable arrays, capable of generating S desired co-polar patterns with low cross-polar patterns, simultaneously reducing the dynamic range ratio (DRR) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excitation amplitudes, and able to transform each pattern into <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> by phase-only control. The method {{can be applied to}} arrays of arbitrary geometry...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a quantum-inspired {{differential}} evolution algorithm {{for solving}} the N-queens problem is presented. The N-queens problem aims at placing N queens on an NxN chessboard, {{in such a}} way that no queen could capture <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> <b>The</b> proposed algorithm is a novel hybridization between differential evolution algorithms and quantum computing principles. Accordingly, differential evolution algorithms have been enhanced by <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> some quantum concepts such as quantum bits and states superposition. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum interference has allowed this hybrid approach to have a remarkable efficiency and good result...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{artists at}} the time {{considered}} Hedrick a 'pre-conceptualist': [...] "Wally's mind, I think... is of primary significance in this way. [...] I think he's much more a preconceptualist than perhaps <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others...</b> <b>the</b> paintings, and the objects that he created are really more expressions of an idea." [...] Indeed, Marcel Duchamp [...] "was one of Wally's greatest gods, always." ...|$|R
5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the Terran Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats to Char, despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, she has not been seen or heard from by <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> characters.|$|E
5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have liked to have publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
50|$|Beyblade type determines play style. The {{three main}} types have a rock-paper-scissors style effectiveness, with Attack {{generally}} being weak to Defense, Defense to Stamina, and Stamina to Attack. However, due to <b>the</b> high variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> custom designs, {{this is not}} a hard rule. Balance types may be strong or weak to <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> depending on specific parts.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven modern modes is {{obtainable}} from <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> by {{a sequence}} of diatonic rotations; by such a sequence, for example, C Ionian (C-D-E-F-G-A-B) becomes D Dorian (D-E-F-G-A-B-C), which becomes E Phrygian (E-F-G-A-B-C-D), and so on, until the original C Ionian mode is obtained. Therefore, each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven modes <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve major keys is a mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> six in that particular key.|$|R
50|$|For example, if {{a person}} {{examines}} a shopping list with one item highlighted in bright green, {{he or she will}} be more likely to remember the highlighted item than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Additionally, in <b>the</b> following list <b>of</b> words - desk, chair, bed, table, chipmunk, dresser, stool, couch - chipmunk will be remembered the most as it stands out against <b>the</b> <b>other</b> words in its meaning.|$|R
