Chapter Two offers a brief comparison of <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> in personal and stock corporations. Chapter Three introduces other entrepreneurs than companies.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this review}} is to explore the legal, ethical, and rights issues {{surrounding}} use of the Australian My Health Record (MyHR) by people with communication disability. Method: A narrative review of the legislation and research affecting the implementation of MyHR in populations with communication disability. Results: Use of MyHR by people with communication disability will require careful consideration in relation to: (a) capacity and consent, (b) roles of nominated or <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> in the system, and (c) the way decisions are made in relation to use of MyHR, including supported decision-making for people with intellectual disability. Conclusion: Legal and ethical issues in use of MyHR by people with communication disability centre on legal rights and equal access. These issues must be addressed if people with communication disability are to have full access to their legal rights and access in exercising personal choice and control {{in the use of}} MyHR.

40|$|Modern tourism expands through {{cultural}} experience, {{which is}} reflected in economic, ecological and socio-cultural effects on destinations. Event tourism is a growing market segment and represents a challenge for all destination stakeholders. As the largest town in the Croatian part of Istria, the City of Pula represents a valid basis {{for the development of}} event tourism due to its coastal geography and rich cultural and historical heritage from antique, medieval and new age periods. The festival and event organisers in Pula use historical and cultural themes in order to develop annual attractions by which they draw in tourists and brand the destination. In this paper, the hypothesis is set on the lack of benefits from event organisation in the destination (the City of Pula) in the ecological, economic and socio-cultural senses.

40|$|The final study {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of one part of Controlling - Internal Inspection - in the selected contributory educational organizations. Is based on general information regarding the subject stated in literature and on the analysis of actual situation in the cooperating non profit organisations. By targeted investigation carried out in specific school organizations I found out that all managers contacted by me were performing internal inspection. Mostly, though, they have been performing the inspection of the individual areas isolatedly without any systematic considerations. From my investigation {{it is obvious that}} managers (<b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> of the organizations or their deputies) who have completed some form of further education of pedagogical personnel focused on management are better oriented in the relevant issues. In my thesis, I suggest a systematic approach towards the internal inspection that takes into account mutual relations. It may be implemented in the conditions of all types of schools. This should bring higher efficientcy in the whole management system and easier competitiveness in the market of schools...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{objectives}} of the study are to understand the current practice of informed consent in medical research in public hospitals in Shanghai, and to share our views with other countries, especially developing countries. Methods In the study, 145 consent forms (CFs) of the selected research projects in eight public hospitals with ethics committees in Shanghai were audited, and the principle investigators (PIs) of these research projects and 40 student subjects {{who had participated in}} clinical drug tests were surveyed by questionnaires. Results The CFs of medical researches in public hospitals with ethics committees in Shanghai were generally acceptable. However, there were some defects in the CFs. Although most of the surveyed PIs had correct recognition of informed consent, some processes of informed consent were not in accordance with generally accepted requirements. A large number of the PIs considered the greatest difficulty with informal consent was lack of correct recognition of subjects or legally <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> on medical research. Discussion Informed consent in medical research should consider the research ethics, the background of potential subjects, the local resources and culture of medical research. In addition, special protection is needed for student subjects in informed consent as well as efforts for building and restoring the public’s trust in biomedical research. Conclusion The informed consent in Shanghai’s public hospitals with ethics committees was generally acceptable and the achievement of adequate informed consent is influenced by many factors...|$|E
40|$|The United Kingdom Financial Services Authority has {{recently}} introduced the "Treating Customers Fairly" initiative. This requires senior level management of regulated financial services firms {{big and small}} to implement strategies to ensure the principle of fair customer treatment is present in their operations. The initiative {{is still in the}} embryonic stages and {{it remains to be seen}} what the level of firm compliance will be and whether fairness strategies adopted by firms will result in fewer instances of financial product mis-selling which was its main impetus. Certain aspects of fair customer treatment at the financial product design, marketing and complaints handling stages have already been identified by the UK regulator as indicative of the presence of fair customer treatment. Financial services licensees in Australia must conduct their operations efficiently, honestly and fairly. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has indicated that this requirement colours all licensee obligations under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), including obligations to ensure firms are sufficiently resourced, staffed with adequately trained personnel, have in place fair internal and external dispute resolution systems and compensation arrangements, and ensure their <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> are adequately trained. Industry codes of practice and conduct also mandate the fair treatment of customers, imposing both general fairness obligations as well as mandating specific obligations which are consistent with fair treatment. Further statutory obligations mandate the giving of disclosure statements and having a reasonable basis for the giving of personal advice. Provisions also exist prohibiting misleading and deceptive conduct and unconscionability. Despite a plethora of regulation in Australia mandating that financial services customers be treated in ways compatible with popularly held precepts of fairness, external dispute resolution bodies still make adverse findings against licensees and customers are still exposed to economic loss in cases of mis-selling. Whilst the United Kingdom’s Treating Customers Fairly initiative has thus far provided food for thought on some manifestations of fair customer treatment so far untouched by the regulator in Australia, evidence does not yet exist to suggest that the introduction of such an initiative in this country would ameliorate current consumer issues in the financial services industry. The main reason for this is that many of these issues appear to stem from a lack of compliance with existing laws. Compliance issues do however beg the question of whether a principle based approach could reduce the incidence of non-compliance by enabling firms to tailor their own consumer protection initiatives to their business strategies. More research is required into this question...|$|E
