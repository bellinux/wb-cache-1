5|$|Banksia spinulosa {{was named}} by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being {{collected}} by John White, most likely in 1792. He {{gave it the}} common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var.cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once <b>again</b> <b>have</b> specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still more {{work to be done}} on the Banksia spinulosa complex.|$|E
5|$|In Quincy Newspapers' {{acquisition}} of Granite Broadcasting's remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have Malara Broadcast Group—which {{served as a}} virtual duopoly partner for Granite with WISE-TV (NBC) Fort Wayne and KDLH-TV Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with WPTA and KBJR-TV in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The acquisition was restructured in July 2015 to, <b>again,</b> <b>have</b> SagamoreHill Broadcasting acquire the two stations, but have their current SSAs wound down within nine months. Following {{the end of the}} SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently-run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA. Quincy similarly wound down an SSA in Peoria, Illinois with Sinclair-owned WHOI by acquiring rights to its ABC and CW programming, and moving them to subchannels of WEEK-TV, in exchange for giving up its Fox affiliation for WSJV-TV in South Bend to Sinclair's WSBT-TV.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} of incomplete achromatopsia {{are similar to}} those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia.

25|$|On 19 March 2015, Williamson ordained Jean-Michel Faure, {{a former}} member of the SSPX, as a bishop in a {{ceremony}} in Nova Friburgo, Brazil. Faure had, like Williamson, opposed reconciliation discussions between the Society and the Vatican. As this was without papal mandate, both Faure and Williamson (<b>again)</b> <b>have</b> incurred a latae sententiae excommunication.|$|E

25|$|The souls {{on account}} of {{accumulation}} of meritorious karmas reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit karmas are exhausted, they once <b>again</b> <b>have</b> to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or hells depending on their karmas. As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.|$|E
25|$|However, {{two years}} of {{revolution}} and anarchy followed, until in 1870 the Cortes declared that Spain would <b>again</b> <b>have</b> a king. Amadeus of Savoy was selected, and duly crowned King of Spain early the following year. Amadeus—a liberal who swore by the liberal constitution the Cortes promulgated—was faced immediately with the impossible task of bringing the disparate political ideologies of Spain to one table.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{definitive}} Eucalyptus fossils {{are surprisingly}} from South America, where eucalypts {{are no longer}} endemic, though have been introduced from Australia. The fossils are from the early Eocene (51.9 Mya), and {{were found in the}} Laguna del Hunco deposit in Chubut province in Argentina. This shows that the genus had a Gondwanan distribution. Fossil leaves also occur in the Miocene of New Zealand, where the genus is not native today, but <b>again</b> <b>have</b> been introduced from Australia.|$|E

25|$|The core lexicon of the Uyghur {{language}} is of Turkic stock, {{but due to}} different kinds of language contact through {{the history of the}} language, it has adopted many loanwords. Kazakh, Uzbek and Chagatai are all Turkic languages which have had a strong influence on Uyghur. Many words of Arabic origin have come into the language through Persian and Tajik, which <b>again</b> <b>have</b> come through Uzbek, and to a greater extent, Chagatai. Many words of Arabic origin have also entered the language directly through Islamic literature after the introduction of the Islamic religion around the 10th century.|$|E
25|$|Scholars have {{increasingly}} explored Ruth in ways which {{allow it to}} address contemporary issues. Feminists, for example, have recast the story {{as one of the}} dignity of labour and female self-sufficiency, and even as a model for lesbian relations, while others have seen in it a celebration of the relationship between strong and resourceful women. Others have criticised it for its underlying, and potentially exploitative, acceptance of a system of patriarchy in which a woman's worth can only be measured through marriage and child-bearing. Others <b>again</b> <b>have</b> seen it as a book that champions outcast and oppressed peoples.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War {{had allowed}} the River Wear {{to emerge as}} a {{competitor}} of the Tyne for coal exports. By 1660 the Tyne coal trade had recovered but was now only a third greater than the Wearside production. At this time the Newcastle Hostmen clashed with the Sunderland coal traders by claiming their charter rights and imposing a shilling tax on all coals exported from Sunderland. The Newcastle monopoly continued until between 1700 and 1750 the coal production increased {{to such an extent}} that non-Hostmen businessmen were drawn in. This seriously weakened the strength of the Hostmen and they would never <b>again</b> <b>have</b> such a stranglehold on the north-east coal trade.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} step of the surgery, an {{internal}} pouch is made of the patient's own small bowel, and this pouch is then hooked back up internally to the rectal stump so that the patient can once <b>again</b> <b>have</b> a reasonably functioning bowel system, all internal. The temporary ileostomy can be reversed at this time so that the patient is internalized for bowel functions, or, in another step to the procedure, the pouch, and rectal stump anastamosis can be left inside the patient to heal for some time while the patient still uses the ileostomy for bowel function. Then, on a subsequent surgery, the ileostomy is reversed and the patient has internalized bowel function again.|$|E
25|$|In the uterus, male fetuses have {{a higher}} {{mortality}} rate (babies are conceived in a ratio estimated to be from 107 to 170 males to 100 females, but the ratio at birth in the United States is only 105 males to 100 females). Among the smallest pre-mature babies (those under 2 pounds or 900 g), females <b>again</b> <b>have</b> a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy {{between men and women}} in the United States dropped from 7.8years in 1979 to 5.3years in 2005, with women expected to live to age80.1 in 2005. Also, data from the UK shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.|$|E

25|$|The Romans {{employed}} a scorched earth policy in its {{fight in the}} north, driving thousands of peasants southwards towards Jerusalem. Between 67 and 68, these peasants, perhaps led by bandits, formed a new political party called the Zealots, which believed that an independent kingdom should be restored immediately through force of arms. It is unclear whether their leaders made messianic claims. The Zealots imprisoned members of the Herodian family, killed the former high priests Ananus ben Artanus and Joshua ben Gamaliel, and put on trial the wealthiest citizens. It is possible that they believed they were purging elements whom they believed would have surrendered to the Romans. But these purges also reveal the great social divide between Jewish peasants and aristocrats at this time. They formed part of a social revolution: although they ultimately lost to the Romans, elite groups like the Hasmoneans, Herodians, and Sadducees would never <b>again</b> <b>have</b> power in Roman Judea.|$|E
25|$|Before {{recording}} By the Way (2002), the Chili Peppers {{decided that}} they would <b>again</b> <b>have</b> Rick Rubin produce the album. In the past, Rubin had given the band creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Originally the album was headed in a much different direction than the final production. The album {{started out as a}} group of fast, hardcore punk songs, which Rubin rejected. Frusciante also wanted a darker, 1980s UK pop/new wave sound mixed in with 1980s hardcore. The recording process was tough for Flea, who felt like an outsider in the band and that his role was being diminished due to a musical power struggle with Frusciante. Flea wanted to create more funk-inspired songs, while Frusciante felt that the band had overused their funk side. Flea considered quitting the band after the album, but the two eventually worked out all their problems.|$|E
25|$|In 1231, when John of Brienne {{arrived in}} Constantinople, Ivan Asen II {{allied with the}} Nicaean Empire against the Latins. After the Nicaeans {{recognized}} the Bulgarian Patriarchate in 1235, Ivan Asen II broke his union with the Papacy. The joint campaign against the Latins was successful, but they failed to capture Constantinople. With John of Brienne's death two years later, Ivan Asen II—who could have again become a regent of Baldwin II—decided to end his cooperation with Nicaea. His decision was further {{based on the assumption}} that after an allied success, Constantinople would <b>again</b> <b>have</b> become the centre of a restored Byzantine Empire, with the Nicaean dynasty as a ruling house. The Bulgarian–Latin cooperation was short-lived; Ivan Asen II remained at peace with his southern neighbours until the end of his reign. Shortly before his death in 1241, Ivan Asen II defeated part of the Mongol army returning to the east after a devastating attack on Poland and Hungary.|$|E
