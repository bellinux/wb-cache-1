While the translation and Brook’s mise en scène clearly identified the source text and culture as Irish, they <b>avoided</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> and rendered the play accessible to francophone audiences without entirely assimilating it to a specific Swiss or French cultural context. Drawing on discourses of theatre translation, and concepts of cosmopolitanism and conviviality, the essay focuses on the potential of such textual and theatrical translation to acknowledge specific cultural traces but also to estrange the familiar perceptions and boundaries of both the source and target cultures, offering modes of interconnection across diverse cultural affiliations...|$|R

The discursive genre of `new realism' {{played a crucial role in}} this retreat from multiculturalism, and that had a dual effect for immigrant women. Whereas formerly they were virtually ignored by both the integration and the emancipation policy, since the triumph of new realism they are in the centre of both policy lines and there is now more policy attention for their needs and interests.

40|$|Teaching {{cultural}} competence to medical {{students in a}} meaningful way is challenging. Trying to teach cultural communication as a measurable skill oversimplifies both the complexities of culture, race, and ethnicity and their effect on the medical interaction. We want to embrace <b>cultural</b> understanding but <b>avoid</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotyping.</b> To ask medical students to learn all the characteristics of a culture potentially categorizes future patients, thus denying them individual identity within the broader racial, ethnic, or cultural label we apply to them. For some, this approach has been denigrated as “political correctness, ” while, {{from the standpoint of the}} patient who is pre-judged by his or her label, it can seem racist. “Cultural humility, ” a concept initially described by Drs. Tervalon and Murray-Garcia [1] is not only more respectful but also more pedagogically sound. Cultural humility asks physicians to understand their own culture(s) as well as that of the patient and view this understanding as a lifelong process of self-reflection and self-critique. If cultural humility is viewed thus, it may encourage the process of personal and professional growth...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} study explored the meanings attributed by migrant Arab Muslim women to their experiences of childbirth in the UK. The {{objectives of the}} study were: •	To explore migrant Arab Muslim women's experiences of maternity services in the UK. •	To examine the traditional childbearing beliefs and practices of Arab Muslim society. •	To suggest ways to provide culturally sensitive care for this group of women. An interpretive ontological-phenomenological perspective informed by the philosophical tenets of Heidegger (1927 / 1962) {{was used to examine}} the childbirth experiences of eight Arab Muslim women who had migrated to one multicultural city in the Midlands. Three in-depth semi structured audiotaped interviews were conducted with each woman; the first during the third trimester of pregnancy (28 weeks onwards), the second early in the postnatal period (1 - 2 weeks after birth) and the third one to three months later. Each interview was conducted in Arabic, then transcribed and translated into English. An adapted version of Smith’s model of interpretive phenomenological analysis (Smith 2003) together with the principles of Gadamer (1989) were used to analyse the interview data, aided by the use of the software package NVivo 2. The analysis of the women’s experiences captures the significance of giving birth in a new cultural context, their perception of the positive and negative aspects of their maternity care and the importance of a culturally competent approach to midwifery practice. Six main themes emerged from analysis of the interviews: ‘displacement and reformation of the self’, ‘by the grace of God’, ‘the vulnerable women,’ ‘adaptation to the new culture,’ ‘dissonance between two maternity health systems’ and ‘the valuable experience’. These themes reflected the women’s lived experiences of their childbirth in the UK. The implications for communities, institutions, midwifery practice and further research are outlined. The study concludes that in providing culturally competent care, maternity caregivers should be aware of what might be significant in the religious and cultural understandings of Arab women but also <b>avoid</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotyping</b> by maintaining an emphasis on individualised care...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} Intercultural Communication (IC) is a {{relatively}} new but fast growing field of research. In a world where more people of diverse languages and cultural backgrounds are coming into contact with one another, IC is primed to play an even more significant role in second and foreign language education as well as cross-cultural training programs. 　This paper briefly gives an overview of IC and the assumptions which underpin the primary areas of interest. The definition of culture plays a significant factor into how educators and trainers approach the field. Traditionally held positivistic views of culture as a static entity influencing our language and behavior in all situations clearly need reexamining. However, language educators and cross-cultural trainers necessarily interested in the more practical aspects of teaching ”culture” are squarely on the positivistic side of the culture paradigm. Therefore, it is vital that we clearly identify how culture is regarded to <b>avoid</b> perpetuating <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> as opposed to highlighting cultural tendencies. 　Finally, because Intercultural Communication seeks to identify and raise awareness of cultural-specific types of behavior and language, it can help create a climate of tolerance and trust in face-to-face interaction. To be a true ”interculturalist”, we not only {{need to be aware of}} ”the other” culture 2 ̆ 7 s tendencies but of our own as well...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{research}} in the field of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) has increasingly focused on the relationship between culture and learning.

Six Australian TESOL teachers were interviewed to determine {{the nature and extent of}} the <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> that they held, particularly as they pertained to specific learning-related behaviours. A qualitative analysis of the data revealed that teachers most often grouped students in terms of national or regional cultures and believed that cultural background strongly influenced student learning behaviour, resulting in the formation of a number of stereotypes. Despite this, the findings also demonstrated that teachers were self-aware of the pitfalls of <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotyping</b> and took other factors influencing student behaviour into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that discrimination {{is a frequent}} occurrence for many transgender individuals (i. e., individuals who were born female but identify as men or who were born male but identify as women, respectively). There is little empirical evidence, however, to explain why this is so. Previous {{research has shown that}} <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotype</b> content, which reflects common beliefs about the characteristics of an outgroup, is associated with prejudice and discrimination against the outgroup in question. For example, the stereotype content model proposes that the degree to which <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> of outgroups are warm and competent is due to their position in society relative to the ingroup; variation along these dimensions has been shown to predict the nature of the prejudice and discrimination directed against the outgroup. To identify beliefs about transgender men and women, the <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> of transgender individuals were investigated using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Study 1 utilized focus groups to investigate the beliefs that university students hold about transgender men and women. Eight themes emerged from the thematic analysis of these data. Traits extracted from these themes were then added to a previously developed list of traits and distributed to a larger group of students in an Internet survey (Study 2). This survey asked participants to rate these traits on {{the degree to which they}} are included in the <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotype</b> of either transgender men or women, and on the degree to which they personally believe them to be characteristic of transgender men or women. The survey data were analyzed to reveal the content, strength, and valence of stereotypes of transgender men and women. The <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotype</b> of transgender men was more strongly negative than was that of transgender women. This result was not observed in participants’ personal stereotypes of transgender individuals. Furthermore, participants’ reported <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> were negatively correlated with the transprejudice they espoused such that the higher their transprejudice scores, the more negative were the stereotypes they reported. The implications of these findings for conceptualizations of transprejudice are discussed, limitations of a commonly used measure of stereotype content are highlighted, and suggestions for future research based on the present results are provided...|$|R

40|$|English title: <b>Cultural</b> <b>Stereotypes</b> and Bias Towards the Indians in Writing of Rudyard Kipling. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{characterize}} and dispute the <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and prejudices against the Indians depicted in the writings of Rudyard Kipling (1865 – 1936), one of the most popular British novelists of the Victorian era. The starting point for these reflections is George Orwell’s essay in which he describes Kipling as a racist and imperialist as well as a morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting figure. To verify this view the present author undertakes an analysis of the <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and prejudices embedded in the selected novels by Kipling. In reconsidering Kipling’s works, she traces the connections between his own world-view and the negative reception of Indians within the Anglo-Indian community by which he was largely shaped. The paper concludes by supporting Orwell’s criticism and demonstrating how Kipling reinforced the stereotype of an Indian, thus reflecting the cultural cliché widespread among the xenophobic and conservative Anglo-Indians in the 19 th century...|$|R

Methods: A quasi-experimental design, ex post facto with observational analyses, was used in this study. The cultural view on competence and warmth was assessed in 100 caregivers working in a set of six residential geriatric care units (three of them organized following a person-centered care approach and the other three providing standard geriatric care). In order to assess caregivers’ cultural stereotypical views, the SCM questionnaire was administered. To evaluate the role of caregivers’ <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in their professional performance as well as in older adult functioning, two observational scales from the Sistema de Evaluación de Residencias de Ancianos (assessment system for older adults residences) -RS (staff functioning and residents’ functioning) were applied. Results: Caregivers’ cultural views of older adults (compared to young people) are characterized by low competence and high warmth, replicating the data obtained elsewhere from the SCM. Most importantly, the person-centered units predict better staff performance and better resident functioning than standard units. Moreover, <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotyping</b> of older adult competence moderates the effects of staff performance on resident functioning, in line with the findings of previous research. Conclusion: Our results underline the influence of caregivers’ <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> on the type of care, as well as on their professional behaviors and on older adult functioning. Caregivers’ <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> could be considered as a central issue in older adult care since they mediate the triangle of care: caregivers/older adults/type of care; therefore, much more attention should be paid to this psychosocial care component.

40|$|In this {{research}} we investigated whether feelings about an imagined potentially negative interaction {{with a member}} of another ethnic group was affected more by valence than content of stereotypes, and whether the differential influence of perception and meta-perception was similar for dominant and dominated groups within a given society. Prejudice, <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and meta-stereotypes were measured for both the dominant and the subordinate group, white and black South Africans, respectively. We found that prejudice was related to the perception of a more negative <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotype</b> of the other ethnic group, and to the perception of a more positive meta-stereotype of one's own ethnic group. However, this latter result was found only for the dominant group. Furthermore, for both the dominant and the subordinate groups, prejudice predicted more negative than positive feelings. For the subordinate group, a more negative <b>cultural</b> <b>stereotype</b> predicted more anxiety-related feelings, and a more negative meta-stereotype predicted less happy feelings about such an interaction. For the dominant group, stereotypes were not predictive of feelings about the interaction. Overall, the relationship between stereotypes, prejudice, and feelings appears to be based on valence rather than on specific content of the stereotypes...|$|R
