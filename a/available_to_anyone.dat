25|$|In October 1999, the Islamic Waqf, and the Islamic Movement {{conducted}} an illegal dig which inflicted much archaeological damage. The earth from this operation, which has archeological wealth relevant to Jewish, Christian and Muslim history, was removed by heavy machinery and unceremoniously dumped by trucks into the nearby Kidron Valley. Although the archeological finds {{in the earth}} are already not in situ, this soil still contains great archeological potential. No archeological excavation was ever conducted on the Temple Mount, and this soil was the only archeological information that has ever been <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> For this reason Israeli archaeologists Dr. Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Zweig established a project sifting all the earth in this dump: the Temple Mount Sifting Project.|$|E
25|$|HOAC's {{system of}} office was convoluted. The {{organization}} was to feature four officers: a President, Vice President, General Secretary, and Treasurer. Vice Presidents were to automatically succeed {{to the office}} of president in the subsequent year and were thus to be the chief competitive election. A nominating committee appointed by the President was to provide one nominee, with others added to the list by membership petition. A six-member Central Committee, elected to a three-year term, was to directly appoint the General Secretary and Treasurer, who would join the Central Committee, along with the President and Vice President and the three most recent past presidents. This Central Committee was to meet annually at a time and place determined at its pleasure. Dues were formally set at $5 per annum by the constitution, with a special life membership made <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> contributing $1,000 or more to the organization. This dues rate remained in effect until 1990, when dues moved to a rate of $10 per annum by decision of the HOAC Central Committee. Dues rose again in 2002, this time to $25 per year, due to the launch of a new academic journal, subscriptions to which were included in the cost of membership dues.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December 2014 the EU {{requested}} WTO mediated {{consultations with}} the US over the tax incentives {{given by the}} state of Washington to large civil aircraft manufacturers which they believed violated the earlier WTO ruling, on 22 April 2015 {{at the request of the}} EU a WTO panel was set up to rule on the complaint. The tax incentives given {{by the state of}} Washington and believed to be the largest in US history surpassing the previous record of $5.6bn over 30 years awarded by the state of New York to the aluminum producer Alcoa in 2007. The $8.7bn over 40 years incentive to Boeing to manufacture the 777X in the state includes $4.2bn from a 40% reduction in business taxes, £3.5bn in tax credits for the firm, a $562m tax credit on property and buildings belonging to Boeing, a $242m sales tax exemption for buying computers and $8m to train 1000 workers, Airbus alleges this is larger than the budgeted cost of Boeing's 777X development program and the EU argues amounts to an entire publicly funded free aircraft program for Boeing, the legislation was an extension of the duration of a tax break program given to Boeing for Dreamliner development that had already been ruled illegal by the WTO in 2012. Boeing defends the allegation by arguing the subsidies are <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> however for an aircraft to qualify for the tax breaks a company must manufacture aircraft wings and perform all final assembly for an aircraft model or variant exclusively in the state.|$|E
