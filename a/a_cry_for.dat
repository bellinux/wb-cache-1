The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E

25|$|In late 2005, the {{drinking}} water crisis of the Kashechewan First Nation received national media attention when E. coli was discovered in their water supply system, following two years of living under a boil-water advisory. The drinking water was supplied by a new treatment plant built in March 1998. The cause of the tainted water was a plugged chlorine injector that was not discovered by local operators, who were not qualified to be running the treatment plant. When officials arrived and fixed the problem, chlorine levels were around 1.7mg/l, which was blamed for skin disorders such as impetigo and scabies. An investigation led by Health Canada revealed that the skin disorders were likely due to living in squalor. The evacuation of Kashechewan was largely viewed by Canadians as <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> help for other underlying social and economic issues which Aboriginal people in Canada face.|$|E
25|$|Florence {{hosted the}} Great Ecumenical Council in 1439; this council was {{launched}} {{in an attempt to}} reconcile the Byzantine Orthodox Church with Roman Catholicism. Pope Eugenius IV convened it in reply to <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> assistance from the Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) John VIII Palaiologos. JohnVIII's empire was slowly being devoured by the Ottoman Turks. The council was a huge boost to Florence's international prestige. The council deliberated until July 1439. Both parties had reached a compromise, and the Pope agreed to militarily aid the Byzantine Emperor. Unfortunately, upon JohnVIII's homecoming to Constantinople, the Greeks rejected the compromise, leading to riots throughout what remained of the Byzantine Empire. JohnVIII was forced to repudiate the agreement with the Roman church to appease the rioters. As a result, no Western aid was forthcoming and the Byzantine Empire's fate was sealed. Fourteen years later in 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans.|$|E

500|$|McMillen's {{childhood}} {{experiences and}} fears {{were used for}} the game's themes of loneliness, nervousness, and fear of abandonment or rejection. The boy's journeys through space represent inward-thinking and imagination, planets represent fears and the inhabitants personify McMillen's childhood [...] "inner demons". He was initially unsure {{as to whether or not}} he wished to release Aether, since it was based on personal experiences and made him feel vulnerable. Glaiel created the game's planets and gameplay, designing the layout of the planets to convey the emotions involved in the game, but he did not know which planets would ultimately be used to relate to each emotion. He felt that the game's sense of emotion and mood was improved because development was not thoroughly planned from the outset. Both developers expressed a wish to port the game to the WiiWare service on the Wii video game console. Aether was released as part of McMillen's game and comic compilation CD This is <b>a</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>For</b> Help in early November 2008.|$|E
500|$|The {{background}} vocals in {{the song}} were compressed using a compressor program called Waves Renaissance Compressor, which was used {{in order to create}} an enhanced polished effect. In an interview with Sound on Sound, mixing engineer Phil Tan, who carried out the audio mixing on [...] "SOS", explained that he compressed the background vocals because [...] "SOS" [...] is a [...] "high energy track", and he wanted the vocals to complement it. Tan also noted that the background vocals were pitch shifted to increase tonal quality and create an enhanced effect during the chorus. The pitch shifting consisted of making the left vocals flat and the right vocals sharp, with varying degrees of delay, and later mixing them together. When asked about the production of the lead vocals, Tan described the song as [...] "a pounding type of song, and the lyrics are <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> help, so the vocals need to be 'in your face', almost aggressive," [...] and said that he wanted the vocals to remain constant. As with the background vocals, the lead vocals were compressed using the Waves Renaissance Compressor. Tan continued to note that the lack of reverb included on [...] "SOS" [...] was largely {{due to the fact that}} being an uptempo song, there was not a lot of room left to add anything else. Tan explained the production process of sampling [...] "Tainted Love", as well as the changes which were made: ...|$|E

2500|$|A larger {{ceremony}} was held again on April 8 in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, {{this time with}} Governor Sandoval Díaz and the victims' families. Over 1,000 people attended the ceremony. In his eight minute speech, Sandoval Díaz stated that the attack would not go unpunished. [...] "They {{will not be an}} extra number in our statistics," [...] he said. He also stated that the assassins were going to [...] "pay" [...] for what they did, and clarified that it was not <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> war, but rather <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> peace and justice. He also asked all police corporations to continue fighting organized crime. Solorio Aréchiga read the names of all the officers killed, but had to stop momentarily to sob. For each of the names, the policemen repeated the same process as before, yelling [...] "present" [...] for each of them. After that, the police band did a taps call. Once it concluded, the audience clapped for one minute. The coffins were wrapped in the Flags of Jalisco. In front of each coffin was a flower arrangement, the banner of the Fuerza Única branch, and a framed photograph of the victim. Each of the victims' family members were given an official banner of the state of Jalisco. A year later, on April 6, 2016, the Government of Jalisco hosted another ceremony near the ambush site with the victims' families.

[...] Hirsch's correspondence led nowhere. Baron Albert Rothschild {{had little to}} do with the Jews. Herzl was disliked by the bankers (Finanzjuden) and detested them. [...] Herzl was defiant of their social authority. [...] He also shared Pinkser's pessimistic opinion that the Jews had no future in Europe; that they were too antisemitic to tolerate because each country in Europe had tried antisemitic assimilation. [...] In Berlin they said Juden raus in a well worn phrase. [...] Herzl therefore advocated a mass exodus from Europe to the Judenstaat. [...] Pinkser's manifesto was <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> help; a warning to others Mahnruf, a call for attention to their plight. Herzl's vision was less about mental states of Jewry, and more about delivering prescriptive answers about land. [...] "The idea that i have developed is a very old one; it is the restoration of the Jewish State" [...] was a follow-up of Pinkser's early weaker version Mahnruf an seine Stammesgenossen von einem nassichen Juden.|$|E

2500|$|Steven {{returned}} to the serial as a regular character following his release from hospital. Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with Stacey Slater (played by Lacey Turner), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven – infuriated by Ian's rejection – soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. Aaron Sidwell explained, [...] "He is deeply depressed about the way Ian has been treating him since he {{returned to}} the Square...Steven just wants to end it all! Stacey is incredibly scared by what’s going on. He tells her to go away, but Stacey is determined {{to get him out of}} The Arches and stop him doing something very stupid...What he is doing is <b>a</b> <b>cry</b> <b>for</b> help." [...] In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.|$|E
