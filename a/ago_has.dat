5|$|Volcanism {{as early}} as 14.5million years <b>ago</b> <b>has</b> {{been linked to the}} Anahim hotspot, with the latest {{eruption}} having taken place in the last 8,000years. This volcanic activity has produced rocks that show a bimodal distribution in composition. While these rocks were being deposited, the hotspot coincided with periods of crustal extension and uplift. Activity in modern times has been limited to earthquakes and volcanic gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>has</b> nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} in the Solar System is 0.121 ppb (parts per billion). This figure is {{two and a}} half times higher than that of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years <b>ago</b> <b>has</b> increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca and the later Coipasa lake phase {{is associated with}} the Central Andean Pluvial Event, which occurred from 18,000–14,000 to 13,800–9,700 BP. During this epoch, major environmental changes occurred in the Atacama as precipitation increased between 18° and 25° degrees south. In some areas, oases formed in the desert and human settlement began. During the Coipasa lake cycle, precipitation may have focused on the southern Altiplano and been transported there from the Chaco; the main Tauca cycle may have been accompanied by precipitation from the northeast. A glacial advance in the Turbio valley (a feeder of the Elqui River) between 17,000 and 12,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>has</b> been attributed to the Central Andean Pluvial Event. Other indicators point to dry conditions in central Chile during the highstand of Lake Tauca.|$|E
5|$|The family Formicidae {{belongs to}} the order Hymenoptera, which also {{includes}} sawflies, bees, and wasps. Ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps, and a 2013 study suggests {{that they are a}} sister group of the Apoidea. In 1966, E. O. Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant (Sphecomyrma) that lived in the Cretaceous period. The specimen, trapped in amber dating back to around 92million years <b>ago,</b> <b>has</b> features found in some wasps, but not found in modern ants. Sphecomyrma was possibly a ground forager, while Haidomyrmex and Haidomyrmodes, related genera in subfamily Sphecomyrminae, are reconstructed as active arboreal predators. Older ants in the genus Sphecomyrmodes have been found in 99 million year-old amber from Myanmar. After the rise of flowering plants about 100million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60million years ago. Some groups, such as the Leptanillinae and Martialinae, are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil.|$|E

25|$|The revised 2016 dating of 50,000 {{years ago}} {{is close to the}} time that modern humans reached the area, {{suggesting}} that the initial encounter with H.sapiens caused or contributed to the demise of H.floresiensis. This would be consistent with the disappearance of H.neanderthalensis from Europe about 40,000 years ago, within 5,000 years after the arrival of modern humans there, and other anthropogenic extinctions.

25|$|The Imperial {{patronage}} {{promoted the}} art of making elaborate cricket containers and individual cricket homes. Traditional Chinese cricket homes come in three distinct shapes: wooden cages, ceramic jars, and gourds. Cages are used primarily for trapping and transportation. Gourds and ceramic jars are used as permanent cricket homes in winter and summer, respectively. They are treated with special mortar to enhance the apparent loudness and tone of a cricket's song. The imperial gardeners grew custom-shaped molded gourds tailored to each species of cricket. Their trade secrets were lost during the Chinese Civil War and the Cultural Revolution, but crickets remain a favorite pet of the Chinese to the present day.

25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it was hard for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where it was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as {{we have seen in the}} colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years <b>ago</b> <b>has</b> determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E
25|$|Olivers Hill is {{the most}} {{prominent}} elevation in Frankston which rises to 55 metres above sea level (180 feet) at its highest point in the suburb. Its origins date to approximately 415 to 360 million years ago. Its base is Mount Eliza Granite dating from the Devonian period, which was covered in lava tuffs in the Paleogene period. During the Miocene epoch in the Neogene period, the Frankston area was entirely flooded by the sea resulting in a mix of Balcombe Clay (at deep levels) and Baxter Sandstone (at shallow levels) covering the basaltic (lava) level. Fluctuating ice ages of the Pleistocene epoch in the current Quaternary period caused sea levels to rise and fall dramatically and for sedimentary rock and sand to be deposited {{on the surface of}} the hill. Aeolian processes in the current Holocene epoch, in which Port Phillip has periodically dried up (as recently as 1000 years <b>ago),</b> <b>has</b> caused further sand to be deposited.|$|E

500|$|Waves {{and storm}} surges {{accompanying}} tropical cyclones erode undersea sands, erode shell deposits, break off corals from near shore reefs in their paths, and carry all this detritus landwards in a rolling wave {{of material that}} is deposited onshore, above highest astronomical tide as a ridge of sand, shell and coral.

500|$|Rifting and crustal {{extension}} in Queen Charlotte Sound up {{to about}} 17million years <b>ago</b> <b>has</b> {{been linked to the}} Early Miocene passage of the Anahim hotspot. Yorath and Chase (1981) proposed that subcrustal melting above the Anahim plume resulted in weakening of the regional crust, setting the stage for rift development. The rifting probably involved crustal pentrative listric faults, which tend to leve out with depth. Later, widespread volcanism produced subearial basalt and rhyolite flows in the region of the rift and along transcurrent faults that extend towards the northwest. Haida Gwaii was displaced approximately [...] to the north along a series of faults extending through Sandspit and Louscoone Islet. This period of rifting and crustal extension contributed to the formation of the Queen Charlotte Basin.|$|E
