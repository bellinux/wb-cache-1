5|$|Within Singapore, the {{national}} flag {{takes precedence over}} all other flags, subject to international practice. As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must {{be in a position}} of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, {{to the left of the}} other flags (<b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{critics have}} noted the {{similarity}} between Qwak! and the 1984 Nintendo light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled Duck Hunt. Nintendo used that similarity in a 1986 court case attempting to invalidate a patent held by Sanders Associates; the patent, filed by Ralph Baer, was for the light gun peripheral used in the Magnavox Odyssey light gun game and held to be infringed on by Duck Hunt. Nintendo unsuccessfully claimed that Baer had based his patent {{not only on the}} Odyssey work but also on Qwak! <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> him at the 1974 MOA show.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E

5|$|When {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} on a platform or stage, it must be above all decorations and be behind and above any person speaking from the platform or stage. If it is displayed from a staff standing on the platform or stage, it must {{be on the right}} side of the person speaking from the platform or stage. Finally, when the flag is hung, it must be hung against a vertical wall or other vertical flat surface, with the crescent and stars on the top left position <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> any spectator facing the flag and the wall or surface.|$|E
5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> a synthetic camera.|$|E
5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
