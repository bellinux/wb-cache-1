The performance specifications associated with these needs can vary widely according to application. Alignment tolerance needs also tend to vary greatly, as can requirements on power consumption. An example of a modular photonic data and/or power transfer link that can be applied to military and aerospace needs is presented. In this approach, a link is designed for low (< 10 kb/s) data rates, ultra-low electrical power consumption, large alignment tolerance, and power transfer to provide complete electrical shielding in <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>module</b> that might be found in a military or aerospace application...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- OmniRPC is a Grid RPC {{system for}} {{parallel}} programming in cluster and grid environments. To support typical master-worker grid {{applications such as}} a parametric execution efficiently, OmniRPC provides <b>an</b> automaticinitializable <b>remote</b> <b>module</b> to send and store data to <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> executable invoked in the remote host. Since it may accept several requests for subsequent calls by keeping the connection alive, the data set by the initialization is re-used, resulting in efficient execution by {{reducing the amount of}} communication. It allows to use several authentication systems including “ssh ” and “globus GRAM”. For a cluster over a private network, an agent process running the server host functions as a proxy to relay communications between the client and the remote executables by multiplexing the communications into one connection to the client. Several algorithms and applications for a grid are designed or re-targeted by using OmniRPC. In this paper, we present a parallel method for large sparse generalized eigenvalue problems, a gridenabled Molecular Conformational Space Search Program (CONFLEX-G), and a grid-enabled Heterogeneous Multi-Computer System (HMCS-G) for computational astrophysics in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniRPC.

40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented a Grid RPC sys-tem called OmniRPC, for parallel programming in cluster and grid environments. While OmniRPC inherits its API from Ninf, the programmer can use OpenMP for easy-to-use parallel programming because the API {{is designed to}} be thread-safe. To support typical master-worker grid ap-plications such as a parametric execution, OmniRPC pro-vides <b>an</b> automatic-initializable <b>remote</b> <b>module</b> to send and store data to <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> executable invoked in the remote host. Since it may accept several requests for subsequent calls by keeping the connection alive, the data set by the initializa-tion is re-used, resulting in efficient execution by reducing the amount of communication. The OmniRPC system also supports a local environment with “rsh”, a grid environ-ment with Globus, and remote hosts with “ssh”. Further-more, the user can use the same program over OmniRPC for both clusters and grids because a typical grid resource is regarded simply as a cluster of clusters distributed geo-graphically. For a cluster over a private network, an agent process running the server host functions as a proxy to relay communications between the client and the remote executa-bles by multiplexing the communications into one connec-tion to the client. This feature allows a single client to use <b>a</b> thousand of <b>remote</b> computing hosts. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Neuroscience and neuroprosthetic {{devices are}} in-creasingly {{in need of}} more compact less {{invasive}} 3 -D electrode arrays for interfacing with neural tissue. To meet these needs, a folding 64 -site 3 -D array architecture has been developed. The microstructure, in which four probes and two platforms are fabri-cated as a single planar unit, results in a low-profile (< 350 -μm) narrow-platform (0. 604 -mm 2 silicon footprint) implant for corti-cal use. Signals are routed from 177 -μm 2 iridium sites through polysilicon lines to the probe back end and then across 4 -μm-thick parylene-encased electroplated-gold folding lead transfers to the associated platform. Three levels of interconnect with a 10 -μm minimum pitch are utilized for the 32 leads that traverse the platforms. After rapid microassembly, micromachined latches are used to fasten the folded device. Two flexible parylene cables with gold leads at a 20 -μm pitch are monolithically integrated with the probes to minimize tethering and avoid any need for lead bonding within the array, and these cables carry the neural signals to <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> circuit <b>module</b> or percutaneous connector. With thin (∼ 15 -μm) boron-doped shanks at a ∼ 200 -μm pitch, the array displaces only 1. 7 % of the 0. 64 -mm 2 instrumented tissue area, assuming a 100 -μm recording range.

40|$|Abstract. The Department of Medieval Archaeology at the University of Siena {{has long}} been engaged {{in the study of}} the ancient landscape, {{essentially}} through intensive field survey and surface collection from agricultural surfaces, the analysis of vertical aerial photographs and the stratigraphical interpretation of monuments. In the last ten years the Laboratory of Information Technology Applied to Medieval Archaeology (LIAAM) has directed its work towards the development and application of global management systems for archaeological documentation. This work has involved not only archaeological excavation but also the preparation and publication of archaeological cartography through the development of GIS dedicated systems. This type of solution allows the realization of three main objectives: acceleration of investigative times, sophisticated elaboration of “intra ” and “inter ” site data, and real possibilities for tutelage. In particular, we can now for the first time produce efficient instruments for integrating archaeology into the politics of teaching and for achieving a fuller appreciation of the landscape around us. In the past, there have been in essence two fundamental problems: insufficient precision in describing the location of discoveries and the absence of efficient instruments for processing the resulting data. Now, with the georeferenced definition of site boundaries, based on differential GPS technology managed using Geographic Information System, this gap has been conclusively filled. In recent years we have been working towards the integration into the GIS base of <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> sensing <b>module</b> able to process, integrate and maximise the data received from various sources: vertical and oblique aerial photography, high-resolution satellite imagery, geophysical surveying and micro-digital terrain modelling using differential GPS.

A main difficulty facing geographers and environmental scientists in environmental assessment and measurement is that spatial analytical tools are not easily accessible. We have recently developed <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> sensing/GIS software <b>module</b> called Image Characterization and Modeling System (ICAMS) to provide specialized spatial analytical tools for the measurement and characterization of satellite and other forms of spatial data. ICAMS runs on both the Intergraph-MGE and Arc/info UNIX and Windows-NT platforms. The main techniques in ICAMS include fractal measurement methods, variogram analysis, spatial autocorrelation statistics, textural measures, aggregation techniques, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and delineation of land/water and vegetated/non-vegetated boundaries. In this paper, we demonstrate the main applications of ICAMS on the Intergraph-MGE platform using Landsat Thematic Mapper images from the city of Lake Charles, Louisiana. While the utilities of ICAMS' spatial measurement methods (e. g., fractal indices) in assessing environmental conditions remain to be researched, making the software available to a wider scientific community can permit the techniques in ICAMS to be evaluated and used for a diversity of applications. The findings from these various studies should lead to improved algorithms and more reliable models for environmental assessment and monitoring...|$|R
