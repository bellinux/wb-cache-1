5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants <b>and</b> <b>fed</b> to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{reported}} here was to investigate changes in the digestive enzyme content in the pancreas after food and secretagogue stimulation. Rats from which food had been withheld overnight were either <b>fed</b> (between 6 <b>and</b> 8 a. m.) or not before euthanasia and pancreatic excision (at 8 a. m. : 21 not <b>fed</b> <b>and</b> 21 <b>fed)</b> <b>and</b> at 4 (12 p. m. : six not <b>fed</b> <b>and</b> six <b>fed)</b> <b>and</b> 8 h later (4 p. m. : six not <b>fed</b> <b>and</b> six <b>fed).</b> Another 16 rats were anesthetized, fitted with jugular vein and pancreatic duct catheters, and infused with the secretagogues, CCK- 33 and secretin, during 1. 5 h of pancreatic juice collection before euthanasia and pancreatic excision. The pancreata were homogenized, and total soluble protein and individual enzyme (trypsin and amylase) tissue contents were analyzed. Results indicated lower amounts of protein and enzymes remaining in the pancreata of the fed, compared with non-fed rats. Enzyme values indicated recovery within four hours in fed rats, but non-fed rats also had increased values during daytime. High enzyme secretion during the high dose of hormonal stimulation was reflected in lower enzyme values remaining in the pancreas, compared with that in response to low-dose stimulation. Results indicated that stimulation of the pancreas, either by food ingestion or exogenous secretagogues, lowers the amounts of digestive enzymes remaining in the pancreas, and imply that stimulation and circadian rhythms influence the pancreatic enzyme content at euthanasia. This finding should be borne in mind in interpretation of data from pancreatic studies...|$|R

5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell.

40|$|Plasma {{fibronectin}} concentration {{was measured}} in neonates of 2 to 5 days of age. Although breast <b>fed</b> <b>and</b> formula <b>fed</b> infants were similar in demographic characteristics, the mean (SD) plasma concentration of fibronectin in 26 breast fed infants, 237 (117) mg/l, {{was significantly higher than}} in 27 formula fed infants (171 (91) mg/l). Fibronectin was detected in five colostrum specimens (mean concentration 13. 4 mg/l). Similar bands were detected after gel electrophoresis of purified adult plasma fibronectin and whole plasma from breast <b>fed</b> <b>and</b> formula <b>fed</b> neonates after staining or immunoblotting. Fibronectin isolated from breast milk also appeared similar to purified plasma fibronectin. It is possible, although unlikely, that fibronectin is absorbed intact from ingested colostrum. Alternatively, a factor(s) might be present in colostrum that contributes to the regulation of plasma fibronectin concentration...|$|R

5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey.

Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension.

5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived <b>and</b> <b>fed</b> like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane.

5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured <b>and</b> <b>fed</b> to its chicks.|$|E
