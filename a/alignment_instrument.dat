40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} the per-operative process of shoulder joint replacement, time-action analysis can be used. Material/Methods: Forty procedures performed by 7 surgeons with different experience rising 5 different prostheses and 3 different Surgical approaches were analyzed. Results: The surgical procedures showed a large variation in, for example, duration, tasks of team members, and protocol used. The surgical procedure {{was influenced by}} several factors, such as the prosthesis used, the surgical approach, the patient's condition, {{and the experience of}} the surgeon. Exposure of the glenoid was difficult and several retractors were needed, which were held by an extra assistant or clamped to the table or the surgeon. Two main limitations were seen in all procedures: repeated actions and waiting. Also, five errors could be identified. None of the <b>alignment</b> <b>instruments</b> was completely reliable and they allowed the surgeon to make major errors. Conclusions: Better <b>alignment</b> <b>instruments,</b> pre-operative planning techniques, and operation protocols are needed for shoulder prostheses. The training of resident surgeons should be focused on the exposure phase, the alignment of the humeral head, the exposure of the glenoid, and the alignment of the glenoid. Evaluating the surgical process using time-action analysis can be used to determine the limitations during surgical procedures. Furthermore, it shows the large variation in factors affecting surgical performance, indicating that a system approach is needed to improve surgical outcome...|$|R
40|$|In atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM), {{the exchange}} and alignment of the AFM cantilever {{with respect to the}} optical beam and position-sensitive detector (PSD) are often performed manually. This process is tedious and time-consuming and sometimes damages the cantilever or tip. To increase the throughput of AFM in industrial applications, the ability to automatically exchange and align the cantilever {{in a very short time}} with sufficient accuracy is required. In this paper, we present the development of an automated cantilever exchange and optical <b>alignment</b> <b>instrument.</b> We present an experimental proof of principle by exchanging various types of AFM cantilevers in 6 seconds with an accuracy better than 2 um. The exchange and alignment unit is miniaturized to allow for integration in a parallel AFM. The reliability of the demonstrator has also been evaluated. Ten thousand continuous exchange and alignment cycles were performed without failure. The automated exchange and alignment of the AFM cantilever overcome a large hurdle toward bringing AFM into high-volume manufacturing and industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Bayesian method for temporally aligning a music score and an audio rendition. A critical problem in audio-toscore alignment is {{in dealing with}} the wide variety of timbre and volume of the audio rendition. In contrast with existing works that achieve this through ad-hoc feature design or careful training of tone models, we propose a Bayesian audio-to-score alignment method by modeling music performance as a Bayesian Hidden Markov Model, each state of which emits a Bayesian signal model based on Latent Harmonic Allocation. After attenuating reverberation, variational Bayes method is used to iteratively adapt the <b>alignment,</b> <b>instrument</b> tone model and the volume balance at each position of the score. The method is evaluated using sixty works of classical music of a variety of instrumentation ranging from solo piano to full orchestra. We verify that our method improves the alignment accuracy compared to dynamic time warping based on chroma vector for orchestral music, or our method employed in a maximum likelihood setting.

40|$|Although {{primarily}} {{intended as}} a test and <b>alignment</b> <b>instrument</b> in order to commission the VLTI, VINCI has taken useful scientic data {{in its first year}} and a half of operation. Our results employ coherent integration of fringe visibility in which the actual amplitudes of the raw scans are combined linearly after correcting for the position of the fringe within each scan. In addition to reducing the effect of noise compared to incoherent integration, the result contains a broader range of information, including an estimate of the complex visibility spectrum. Such an estimator is thus sensitive to instrumental phase and spectral characteristics, including the variable component of dispersion introduced by the excess air paths in the delay lines. Calibration of such instrumental effects demonstrates the ability to detect source phase at a ne level as will be required for direct interferometric detection of extrasolar planets. We present diameters for ve stars obtained by observing the visibility null in their correlated spectra. Using coherent integration we have also observed the peculiar correlated spectra seen in many Mira variables, possibly due to changes in the apparent diameter with wavelength. Calibration of the zero-baseline power from o Ceti is used with other interferometric observations of this star over a period of 90 days to plot diameter variations associated with its pulsation cycle...|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{reflectometry}} (XRR) provides {{researchers and}} manufacturers with a non-destructive {{way to determine}} thickness, roughness, and density of thin films deposited on smooth substrates. Due to the nested nature of equations modeling this phenomenon, the inter-relation between <b>instrument</b> <b>alignment</b> and parameter estimation accuracy is somewhat opaque. In this study, we intentionally shift incident angle information contained in a high-quality XRR data set and refine this shifted data using an identical structural model to assess the effect angle misalignment has on parameter estimation. We develop a series of calibration curves relating data misalignment to variation with layer thickness and density for a multilayer GaAs/AlAs Certified Reference Material on a GaAs substrate. We then test the validity and robustness of several approaches of using known thickness and density parameters from this structure to calibrate <b>instrument</b> <b>alignment.</b> We find the highest sensitivity to and linearity with measurement misalignment from buried AlAs and GaAs layers, {{in contrast to the}} surface layers, which show the most instability. This is a fortuitous result, as buried AlAs and GaAs exhibit the highest long-term stability in thickness. Therefore, it is indeed possible to use reference thickness estimates to validate XRR angle alignment accuracy. Buried layer mass density information also shows promise as a robust calibration approach. This is suprising, as electron density of buried layers is both a highly-correlated phenomenon, and a subtle component in the XRR model. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figures, 3 table...|$|R

40|$|Background: Accuracy of implant {{placement}} in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial. Traditional extramedullary <b>alignment</b> <b>instruments</b> are fairly effective for achieving the desired mean tibial component coronal alignment. We modified the traditional tibial plateau resection technique and evaluated {{its effect on}} alignment restoration. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-two primary TKAs in our hospital between January 2013 and December 2014 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Group A consisted of 128 primary TKAs performed by one senior surgeon. Preoperative measurement of the tibial resection was conducted on radiographs, and the measured thicknesses of the lateral and medial plateau resection were used to place the tibial alignment guide. Group B consisted of 154 primary TKAs performed by the other senior surgeon, using a traditional tibial plateau resection technique. In all patients, an extramedullary guide was used for tibial resection, and preoperative and postoperative full-leg standing radiographs {{were used to assess}} the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), femoral component alignment angle (FA), and tibial component alignment angle (TA). A deviation ≥ 3 ° was considered unsatisfactory. Data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t-test. Results: The mean postoperative HKA and TA angles were significantly different between Groups A and B (178. 2 ± 3. 2 ° vs. 177. 0 ± 3. 0 °, t = 2. 54, P = 0. 01; 89. 3 ± 1. 8 ° vs. 88. 3 ± 2. 0 °, t = 3. 75, P = 0. 00, respectively). The mean postoperative FA was 88. 9 ± 2. 5 ° in Group A and 88. 9 ± 2. 6 ° in Group B, and no significant difference was detected (t = 0. 10, P = 0. 92). There were 90 (70. 3 %) limbs with restoration of the mechanical axis to within 3 ° of neutral alignment and 38 (29. 7 %) outliers (> 3 ° deviation) in Group A, whereas there were 89 (57. 8 %) limbs with restoration of the mechanical axis to within 3 ° of neutral alignment and 65 (42. 2 %) outliers (> 3 ° deviation) in Group B. The severity of the preoperative alignment deformity was a strong predictor for postoperative alignment.

40|$|The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is a small-sized {{telescope}} (SST) {{that represents}} one of three novel designs {{that are based on}} Schwarzschild–Couder optics and are proposed for use within the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The GAmma-ray Telescope Elements (GATE) program has led an effort to build a prototype of the GCT at the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France. The mechanical structure of the prototype, known as the SST-GATE prototype telescope, is now complete along with the successful installation of the camera. We present the results of extensive simulation work to determine the optical performance of the SST-GATE prototype telescope. Using the ROBAST software and assuming an ideal optical system, we find the radius of the encircled point spread function (θ 80) of the SST-GATE to be ∼ 1. 3 arcmin (∼ 0. 02 °) for an on-axis (θfield= 0 ∘) observation and ∼ 3. 6 arcmin (∼ 0. 06 °) for an observation {{at the edge of the}} field of view (θfield= 4. 4 ∘). In addition, this research highlights the shadowing that results from the stopping of light rays by various telescope components such as the support masts and trusses. It is shown that for on-axis observations the effective collection area decreases by approximately 1 m 2 as a result of shadowing components other than the secondary mirror. This is a similar loss (∼ 11 %) to that seen with the current generation of conventional Davies–Cotton (DC) Cherenkov telescopes. An extensive random tolerance analysis was also performed and it was found that certain parameters, especially the secondary mirror z-position and the tip and tilt rotations of the mirrors, are critical in order to contain θ 80 within the pixel limit radius for all field angles. In addition, we have studied the impact upon the optical performance of introducing a hole in the center of the secondary mirror for use with pointing and <b>alignment</b> <b>instruments.</b> We find that a small circular area (radius < 150 mm) at the center of the secondary mirror can be used for instrumentation without any significant impact upon optical performance. Finally, we studied the impact of reducing the size of the primary mirror for the prototype telescope and found that this comes at the cost of poorer image quality and light collection efficiency for all field angles, but at a significant cost saving for a one-off prototype...|$|R

The structural properties of the myopic eye were measured through central and peripheral autorefraction, and through cornea to retina dimensions using non-contact biometry. In addition, the central and peripheral resolution acuities of myopic and emmetropic eyes for high and low contrast levels were investigated. Our structural and functional measurements revealed relatively prolate myopic eyes with reduced high contrast resolution acuity, compared to emmetropic eyes. Moreover, multiple regression analyses were performed at the fovea and outermost retinal eccentricities common to all core experiments but revealed no strong relationship between the structure and function of the myopic eye.
