Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> same thing." [...] Capuano's speech {{was included in the}} 2010 documentary film Inside Job, described by director Charles H.

"Why, your Reverence," [...] replied Stubbs, [...] "I cannot just say--I will be sworn she was {{not born}} at Witt-ham;* for Gaffer Gibbs looked at {{her all the time}} of service, and he says, she could not turn up a single lesson like a Christian, even though she had Madge Murdockson to help her--but then, as to fending for herself, why, she's a bit of a Scotchwoman, your Reverence, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> worst donnot of them can look out for their own turn--and she is decently put on enow, and not bechounched like t'other." ...|$|E

A {{passenger}} remarks, that [...] "O'Connell never really did any thing for the Irish, but lived on his capacity for exciting their enthusiasm." [...] Thereupon another expresses great contempt for the Irish who could be so taken in. Nevertheless, the capability of a disinterested enthusiasm is, on the whole, a nobler property {{of a human being}} than a shrewd self-interest. I like the Irish all the better for it.|$|E

We could not have gone many more miles, for if we did we should be a regiment without horses tomorrow morning." ...|$|E

But he was the more astonished to hear that she and her sister were considered to be Southern Unionists--and were greatly petted in governmental circles for their sacrificing fidelity to the flag. His informant, an official in the State Department, added that Miss Matilda might have been a good deal of a madcap at the outbreak of the war--for the sisters had a brother in the Confederate service--but that she had changed greatly, and, indeed, within a month.

The story goes, {{that in the}} old Popish times, {{when the}} nuns held Whitford Priors, the first Mr. Lavington that ever was came from the king with a warrant to turn them all out, poor souls, and take the lands for his own. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> head lady of them--prioress, or abbess, as they called her--withstood him, and cursed him, {{in the name of}} the Lord, for a hypocrite who robbed {{harmless}} women under the cloak of punishing them for sins they'd never committed (for they say, sir, he went up to court, and slandered the nuns there for drunkards and worse).

[...] "It {{is well known}} her lord died much in debt, and she, after taking upon her the administration, sold {{everything}} and made what money she could, and is run away into France without paying a farthing of the debts, with only one servant and unknown to all her friends, and hath taken her youngest son, as 'tis supposed to make herself a merit in breeding him a papist.

I am glad the Parliament is prorogued. I stayed with Prior till eleven; the Secretary left us at eight. Prior, I believe, {{will be one of}} those employed to make the peace, when a Congress is opened. Lord Ashburnham told to-day at the Coffee-house that Lord Harley(7) was yesterday morning married to the Duke of Newcastle's daughter, the great heiress, and it got about all the town. But I saw Lord Harley yesterday at noon in his nightgown, and he dined in the City with Prior and others; so it is not true; but I hope it will be so; for I know it has been privately managing this long time:(8) the lady will not have half her father's estate; for the Duke left Lord Pelham's son his heir.(9) The widow Duchess will not stand to the will, and she is now at law with Pelham. However, at worst, the girl will have about ten thousand pounds a year to support the honour; for Lord Treasurer will never save a groat for himself. Lord Harley is a very valuable young gentleman; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> girl is handsome, and has good sense, but red hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "But two of {{the prisoners}} were missing. One was, I heard, an {{apprentice}} who was mixed up in the affair, and no one saw him go. They say he must have stooped down and wriggled away into the crowd. The other was a man they called Black Dick; he struck down two constables, broke through the crowd, and got clean away. There is a great hue and cry, but so far nothing has been heard of them. They will be kept in hiding somewhere till {{there is a chance}} of getting them through the gates or on board a craft lying in the river. Our men made a mess of it, or they would have got them all off. I hear that they are all in a fine taking that Marner is safely lodged in Newgate with the others taken in his house; he knows so much that if he chose to peach he could hang a score of men. Black Dick could tell a good deal, but he wasn't in all the secrets, and they say Marner is really the head of the band and had a finger in pretty nigh every robbery through the country. All those taken in his place are also in Newgate, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> constables are searching the city like ferrets in a rabbit-warren, and that several other arrests have been made." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{have been}} pretty much every where in our gondola. We have bought beads and {{photographs}} in the stores, and wax matches in the Great Square of St. Mark. The last remark suggests a digression. Every body goes to this vast square in the evening. The military bands play in the centre of it and countless couples of ladies and gentlemen promenade {{up and down on}} either side, and platoons of them are constantly drifting away toward the old Cathedral, and by the venerable column with the Winged Lion of St. Mark on its top, and out to where the boats lie moored; and other platoons are as constantly arriving from the gondolas and joining the great throng. Between the promenaders and the side-walks are seated hundreds and hundreds of people at small tables, smoking and taking granita, (a first cousin to ice-cream;) on the side-walks are more employing themselves in the same way. The shops in {{the first floor of the}} tall rows of buildings that wall in three sides of the square are brilliantly lighted, the air is filled with music and merry voices, and altogether the scene is as bright and spirited and full of cheerfulness as any man could desire. We enjoy it thoroughly. Very many of the young women are exceedingly pretty and dress with rare good taste. We are gradually and laboriously learning the ill-manners of staring them unflinchingly in the face--not because such conduct is agreeable to us, but because it is the custom of the country <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> girls like it. We wish to learn all the curious, outlandish ways of all the different countries, so that we can [...] "show off" [...] and astonish people when we get home. We wish to excite the envy of our untraveled friends with our strange foreign fashions which we can't shake off. All our passengers are paying strict attention to this thing, with the end in view which I have mentioned. The gentle reader will never, never know what a consummate ass he can become, until he goes abroad. I speak now, of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad, and therefore is not already a consummate ass. If the case be otherwise, I beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and call him brother. I shall always delight to meet an ass after my own heart when I shall have finished my travels.|$|E
