50|$|The {{decline of}} the <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> began in 1958 and again in 1960 after smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were {{introduced}} into Lake Atitlán. These invasive species reduced the crabs and fish which the grebes depended on for food and the fish even killed the grebe chicks. The population of the <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> declined from 200 individuals in 1960 to 80 in 1965. Thanks to the conservation efforts of Anne LaBastille, in 1966 a refuge was established where this species was able to rebound. The population recovered to 210 in 1973. Unfortunately after the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, the lake bed fractured. An underwater drain led to a {{fall of the water}} level and to a further severe decrease of the number of grebes. In 1983 only 32 individuals were left, of which the largest part were hybrids with the pied-billed grebe. The last two birds were seen in 1989, and after they disappeared the <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> was declared officially extinct.|$|E
5000|$|Podilymbus is a genus {{of birds}} in the Podicipedidae family, {{containing}} the extinct <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podilymbus gigas) and the pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps). [...] The genus name is derived from Latin Podilymbus, a contraction of podicipes ("feet at the buttocks", from podici-, [...] "rump-" [...] + pes, [...] "foot")—the origin {{of the name of}} the grebe order—and Ancient Greek kolymbos, [...] "diver".|$|E
50|$|The {{pied-billed grebe}} (Podilymbus podiceps) is {{a species of}} the grebe family of water birds. Since the <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podilymbus gigas) has become extinct, it is the sole extant member of the genus Podilymbus. The pied-billed grebe is {{primarily}} found in ponds throughout the Americas. Other names of this grebe include American dabchick, dabchick, Carolina grebe, devil-diver, dive-dapper, dipper, hell-diver, pied-billed dabchick, pied-bill, thick-billed grebe, and water witch.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podilymbus gigas), {{also known}} as giant grebe, giant pied-billed grebe, or poc, is an extinct water bird, a {{relative}} of the pied-billed grebe. It was endemic at the Lago de Atitlán in Guatemala {{at an altitude of}} 1700 m asl. It was described in 1929 by Ludlow Griscom based on a specimen collected in 1926 and had been overlooked in the past. American ecologist Anne LaBastille observed the decline of this species over a period of 25 years. It was declared extinct by 1990.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> {{reached a}} length of about 46-50 cm. The call and {{appearance}} were similar to the much smaller pied-billed grebe. The bill was large and pied but the color varied from white in the spring to brown in other seasons. The plumage was mainly dark brown with white-flecked flanks and grey on the ears. The underparts were dark grey flecked with white. The head was almost black and the neck was glossy flecked with dark brown {{in the spring and}} white in the winter. The legs were slaty grey. The bill had a bold black vertical band in the middle. The irises were brown. It had small wings and was flightless.|$|E
50|$|In 1955, {{the area}} around Lake Atitlán became a {{national}} park. The lake was mostly unknown {{to the rest of}} the world, and Guatemala was seeking ways to increase tourism and boost the local economy. It was suggested by Pan American World Airways that stocking the lake with a fish prized by anglers would be a way to do just that. As a result, an exotic non-native species, the black bass, was introduced into the lake in 1958. The bass quickly took to its new home and caused a radical change in the species composition of the lake. The predatory bass caused the elimination of more than two-thirds of the native fish species in the lake and contributed to the extinction of the <b>Atitlan</b> <b>grebe,</b> a rare bird that lived only in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán.|$|E
50|$|Griscom's {{field work}} {{included}} extensive travel across the United States and several expeditions to Central and South America. For the AMNH, {{he worked in}} Nicaragua in 1917. In 1923, he explored Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula, collecting botanical specimens as well as observing birds. He led an expedition to Panama in 1924; members of the party described fifteen new species of birds while he himself published descriptions of the yellow-green finch and the Tacarcuna bush-tanager. In 1925, Griscom {{was part of a}} team led by Gregory Mason and Herbert Spinden that collected specimens for the AMNH in British Honduras, the Yucatan Peninsula, and Cozumel Island. With Maunsell Crosby, he visited the Pearl Islands off Panama in 1927 and Guatemala in 1930. Griscom named two new species {{as a result of the}} Guatemala trip, the flightless <b>Atitlán</b> <b>grebe</b> (now extinct) and (with Jonathan Dwight) the belted flycatcher.|$|E
50|$|The {{largemouth bass}} has been {{introduced}} into many other regions and countries due to its popularity as a sport fish. It causes the decline, displacement or extinctions of species in its new habitat through predation and competition, for example in Namibia. They are an invasive species in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, and are a danger to native fish fry. They have also been blamed for the extinction of the <b>Atitlan</b> <b>Grebe,</b> a large waterbird which once inhabited Lake Atitlan, Guatemala. In 2011, researchers found that in streams and rivers in the Iberian Peninsula, juvenile largemouth bass were able to demonstrate trophic plasticity, meaning {{that they were able}} to adjust their feeding habits to obtain the necessary amount of energy needed to survive. The ability to do such, allows them to be successful as invasive species in relatively stable aquatic food webs. Similarly, a study done in Japan showed that the introduction of both largemouth bass and bluegill into farm ponds have caused increases in the numbers of benthic organisms, resulting from the predation on fishes, crustaceans, and nymphal odonates by the bass. The largemouth bass has been causing sharp decreases in native fish populations in Japan since 1996, especially in bitterling fish in Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma.|$|E
