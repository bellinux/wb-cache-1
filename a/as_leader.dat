30|$|The SNA data do {{depict the}} {{expected}} distribution: many actors who are nominated <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> in STEM education change work {{tend to have}} many direct ties (i.e., high degree centrality) {{as well as a}} high total of direct and “friends of friends” ties (i.e., high two-step reach centrality). Many actors who are not considered leaders tend to have lower metrics. However, this is not universally true. We saw a non-trivial number of false SNA negatives, those who were nominated <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> by survey respondents but would not have been identified merely by SNA data. We also saw a number of false SNA positives, those who were not nominated <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> by survey respondents but would have been identified <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> based on SNA data.|$|R

40|$|Introverts {{are less}} likely to emerge <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> than extraverts, however the {{existing}} literature provides little explanation as to why. To investigate the potential cause of this trait-based difference in emergent leadership, we measured trait extraversion in a sample of 184 business students and studied their leadership-related behavior in an unstructured group task. We drew from a model of forecasted affect to hypothesize that introverts {{would be less likely to}} emerge <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> based on their belief that engaging in the necessary extraverted behavior would be unpleasant/unenjoyable (i. e. they would forecast higher levels of negative affect compared to extraverts). Consistent with this, we found that introverts were less likely to emerge <b>as</b> <b>leaders,</b> and that forecasted negative affect fully accounted for the relationship between extraversion and peer-rated emergent leadership. We therefore argue that introverts fail to emerge <b>as</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>as</b> often as extraverts because they engage in higher levels of forecasted negative affect and that these forecasts impede their emergent leadership potential...|$|R
