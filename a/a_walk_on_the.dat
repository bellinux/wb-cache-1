And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.|$|E

A macaque who belonged to {{the manager of the}} vineyards of the palace attacked Fritz, the German shepherd dog of the sovereign, and he attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander I and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys (which were later destroyed), and the King's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He didn't consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to reprising {{her role as}} Martha Kent in the forthcoming blockbuster Justice League (2017), forthcoming film roles include the role of Audrey Felt in [...] (2017), which also stars Liam Neeson, Michael C. Hall, and Tony Goldwyn (who directed Lane in <b>A</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon). In 2018, Lane will star opposite Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway in the erotic thriller Serenity.

500|$|Lane {{returned}} to acting {{to appear in}} The Big Town and Lady Beware, but Lane had not made another big impression on a sizable audience until 1989's popular and critically acclaimed TV miniseries Lonesome Dove, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role. She {{came very close to}} being cast as Vivian Ward in 1990's blockbuster hit Pretty Woman (which had a much darker script at the time), but due to scheduling, was unable to take the role. Apparently, costume fittings were made for Lane, before the role fell to Julia Roberts. She was given positive reviews for her performance in the independent film My New Gun, which was well received at the Cannes Film Festival. She went on to appear as actress Paulette Goddard in Sir Richard Attenborough's big-budget biopic of Charles Chaplin, 1992's Chaplin. Over the next seven years Lane would star in ten movies, among them were Jack and Judge Dredd. It wasn't until 1999 that Lane earned further recognition for her role in <b>A</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon. The film also stars Liev Schreiber, Viggo Mortensen, and Anna Paquin. One reviewer wrote, [...] "Lane, after years in post-teenaged-career limbo, is meltingly effective." [...] The film's director, Tony Goldwyn, described Lane as having [...] "...this potentially volcanic sexuality that is in no way self-conscious or opportunistic." [...] Lane earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead. At this time, she was interested in making a film about actress Jean Seberg in which she would play Seberg.|$|E

2500|$|Lyne cast Lane in {{the role}} of Constance after seeing her in the film, <b>A</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon. He felt that the actress [...] "breathes a certain sexuality.

[...] Lyne also wanted Gere and Lane to gain weight in order to portray the comfort of a middle-age couple. In particular, he wanted Gere to gain 30 pounds and left donuts in the actor's trailer every morning.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1990s, Mortensen {{appeared}} in supporting roles {{in a variety}} of films, including Jane Campion's The Portrait of a Lady, Young Guns II, Prison, , Sean Penn's The Indian Runner, Danny Cannon's The Young Americans, Carl Colpaert's The Crew, which won the São Paulo Film Festival Audience Award, Brian de Palma's Carlito's Way, [...] Crimson Tide, G.I.

Of these roles, Mortensen was probably best known for playing Master Chief John Urgayle in G.I. Jane.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable movie scene {{involving}} menarche is that from the 1976 horror movie Carrie. Carrie White experiences her first period as she showers after the school gym class, and unaware {{of what is happening}} to her, she panics and pleads for help, but the other girls respond by bullying her. The movie is an adaptation of the novel with the same name by [...] Stephen King. Carrie's first period unleashes her violent powers and is central to her dangerous [...] and out of control transformation. This theme is common to horror movies, another notable example being the 2000 Canadian horror film Ginger Snaps, where the protagonist's first period is central to her gradual transformation into a werewolf. Girls experiencing their first period is part of many movies, though not central to their plot, including The Blue Lagoon, My Girl, <b>A</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|E
