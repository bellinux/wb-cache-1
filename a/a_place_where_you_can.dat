In a track such as [...] "Suburban Relapse", the band wrote about suburbia, where they were born and raised. Steven Severin emphasized: [...] "That's why J.G. Ballard resonated so much with us, because all his near-future tales were set in this bizarre suburban wasteland. Suburbia is <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine any kind of possibility, because there's space, not urban clutter".|$|E

"You {{may think}} so," [...] said Bob, with a laugh, [...] "but you let {{some of these}} oil {{operators}} from Bradford see that, {{and then it would}} do your heart good to hear them offer you big prices for the land.

60|$|But I {{never could}} settle it before, because always when I called at the Foreign Office in Vienna {{to talk about}} it, there wasn't anybody at home, {{and that is not}} <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go in and see for {{yourself}} whether it is a mistake or not, because the person who takes care of the front door there is of a size that discourages liberty of action and the free spirit of investigation.
