5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrides <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> much of Scottish Gaelic {{literature}} and Gaelic music. Today {{the economy of}} the islands is dependent on crofting, fishing, tourism, the oil industry, and renewable energy. The Hebrides have lower biodiversity than mainland Britain, but there is a significant presence of seals and seabirds.|$|E
5|$|The National Diet is the legislature, {{the organ}} of the Legislative branch. It is bicameral, {{consisting}} of two houses with the House of Councillors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house. Its members are directly elected from the people, who <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty. The Supreme Court and other inferior courts make up the Judicial branch, and they are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.|$|E

50|$|However, this {{decision}} created another issue {{as to which}} river <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawa. The Netherlands considered the Marowini (the eastern tributary river) to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawa; the French considered the Litani, located further to <b>the</b> west, to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawa. This issue has still not been resolved.|$|R

5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of}} the most {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh {{has been}} produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, {{it is made}} into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce {{has been used in}} China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{grown as}} {{industrial}} crops <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{a wide range}} of products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E
5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, {{which suggests that the}} Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E
25|$|Wikileaks has {{promoted}} conspiracy {{theories about the}} murder of Seth Rich. Unfounded conspiracy theories, spread by some right-wing figures and media outlets, hold that Rich <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> leaked emails and was killed for working with Wikileaks. Wikileaks fueled the conspiracy theories by offering a reward of $20,000 {{for information leading to}} the capture of Rich's killer and hinting that Rich may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaked emails. No evidence supports the claim that Rich <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaks.|$|R

5|$|Trees <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{many of the}} world's {{best known}} fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and {{a wide range of}} edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E
