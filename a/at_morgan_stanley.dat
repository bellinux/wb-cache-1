25|$|In June 2006, {{prompted}} by a letter from Gary J. Aguirre, the Senate Judiciary Committee began {{an investigation into the}} links between hedge funds and independent analysts. Aguirre was fired from his job with the SEC when, as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against Pequot Capital Management, he tried to interview John Mack, then being considered for chief executive officer <b>at</b> <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley.</b> The Judiciary Committee and the US Senate Finance Committee issued a scathing report in 2007, which found that Aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal for his pursuit of Mack and in 2009, the SEC was forced to re-open its case against Pequot. Pequot settled with the SEC for US$28million and Arthur J. Samberg, chief investment officer of Pequot, was barred from working as an investment advisor.

2500|$|The term [...] "wealth management" [...] {{occurs at}} least as early as 1933.

Family offices that had formerly served just one family opened their doors to other families, and the term Multi-family office was coined. Accounting firms and investment advisory boutiques created multi-family offices as well. Certain larger firms (UBS, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch) have [...] "tiered" [...] their platforms – with separate branch systems and advisor-training programs, distinguishing [...] "Private Wealth Management" [...] from [...] "Wealth Management", with the latter term denoting {{the same type of}} services but with a lower degree of customization and delivered to mass affluent clients. <b>At</b> <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley,</b> the [...] "Private Wealth Management" [...] retail division focuses on serving clients with greater than $20 million in investment assets while [...] "Global Wealth Management" [...] focuses on accounts smaller than $10 million.|$|E

2500|$|On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed {{a lawsuit}} against <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley.</b> Two facts were <b>at</b> issue: Did <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> know about the {{problems}} with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? [...] During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> and ordered the jury to assume <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman. Hobbled, <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> {{had no choice but to}} argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks. After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion. The damages stung particularly because <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million. [...] <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley</b> guilty before the trial began. [...] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of <b>Morgan</b> <b>Stanley's</b> actions. Perelman appealed, but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision. Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was [...] "a classic example of fraud on the court". [...] The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.|$|R
