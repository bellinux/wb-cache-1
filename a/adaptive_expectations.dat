5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations,</b> which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations</b> modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

His close friend George Stigler explained, [...] "As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations, a newer approach developed by Robert Lucas, also at the University of Chicago." [...] The relationship between Friedman and Lucas, or new classical macroeconomics as a whole, was highly complex. The Friedmanian Phillips curve was an interesting starting point for Lucas, but he soon realized that the solution provided by Friedman was not quite satisfactory. Lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the Friedmanian <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations.</b> Due to this reformulation, the story in which {{the theory of the}} new classical Phillips curve was embedded radically changed. This modification, however, had a significant effect on Friedman’s own approach, so, as a result, the theory of the Friedmanian Phillips curve also changed. Moreover, new classical Neil Wallace, who was {{a graduate student at the}} University of Chicago between 1960 and 1963, regarded Friedman’s theoretical courses as a mess. This evaluation clearly indicates the broken relationship between Friedmanian monetarism and new classical macroeconomics.|$|E
2500|$|Rational {{expectations}} theories {{were developed}} in response to perceived flaws in theories based on <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations.</b> [...] Under <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations,</b> expectations of the future value of an economic variable are based on past values. [...] For example, people would be assumed to predict inflation by looking at inflation last year and in previous years. [...] Under <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations,</b> if the economy suffers from constantly rising inflation rates (perhaps due to government policies), people would be assumed to always underestimate inflation. Many economists have regarded this as unrealistic, believing that rational individuals would sooner or later realize the trend and take it into account in forming their expectations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>expectations</b> were {{instrumental}} in the Phillips curve outlined by Milton Friedman. For Friedman, workers form <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations,</b> so the government can easily surprise them through unexpected monetary policy changes. As agents are trapped by the money illusion, {{they are unable to}} correctly perceive price and wage dynamics, so, for Friedman, unemployment can always be reduced through monetary expansions. The result is an increasing level of inflation if the government chooses to fix unemployment at a low rate {{for an extended period of}} time. However, in this framework it is clear why and how <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations</b> are problematic. Agents are arbitrarily supposed to ignore sources of information which, otherwise, would affect their expectations. For example, government announcements are such sources: agents are expected to modify their expectations and break with the former trends when changes in economic policy necessitate it. This is the reason why the theory of <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations</b> is often regarded as a deviation from the rational tradition of economics.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the work}} of Sargent and Wallace, {{macroeconomic}} models were largely based on the <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations</b> assumption. Many economists found this unsatisfactory since it assumes that agents may repeatedly make systematic errors and can only revise their expectations in a backward-looking way. Under <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectations,</b> agents do not revise their expectations even if the government announces a policy that involves increasing money supply beyond its expected growth level. Revisions would only be made after the increase in money supply has occurred, and even then agents would react only gradually. In each period that agents found their expectations of inflation to be wrong, a certain proportion of agents' forecasting error would be incorporated into their initial expectations. Therefore, equilibrium in the economy would only be converged upon and never reached. The government would be able to maintain employment above its natural level and easily manipulate the economy.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} five chapters addressing analytically and empirically U. S. Postwar business cycle fluctuations. Markov Switching models and Bayesian estimation methods {{are used to}} investigate United States macroeconomic dynamics in the last 60 years. Chapter 1 introduces the structure of this dissertation. Chapter 2 proposes a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with Markov Switching and heteroskedastic shocks to examine the role of agents' beliefs separately from changes in monetary policy in explaining inflation fluctuations. Bayesian analysis is conducted with Markov Switching to support regime switches in the private sector, {{in the implementation of}} monetary policy and in the volatility of shocks in the U. S. Postwar economy, which are related to the "Great Inflation", the "Great Moderation" and the 2008 financial crisis. A counterfacutal analysis found that if agents maintained a weak response to macroeconomic dynamics over time, there would be lower inflation during the "Great Inflation". In addition, irrespectively to monetary policy regimes, supply shocks are the main driver of inflation fluctuations, while demand shocks are the main source of changes in the output gap. However, when agents maintain a higher risk aversion towards consumption with a higher slope in the Phillips curve, demand shocks also play a role in driving inflation, even though supply shocks are still the main driver of inflation. Chapter 3 emphasizes on the monetary policy with an investigation on the assumption that policymakers commit to a Taylor rule, using a time-varying inflation-unemployment dynamic model on U. S. economy. This chapter is based on the conjecture that potential policymakers' misperception may be originated from unobserved deviations of unemployment from its natural rate. Five processes are proposed for policymakers' belief under commitment to inflation and unemployment and compare them with a baseline autoregressive process without commitment. The models are estimated using Bayesian techniques. Empirical results are as follows: First, policymakers' belief is very persistent even when it commits to a Taylor-type policy rule. Second, the run-up of U. S. inflation around 1980 can be mostly attributed to policymakers' misperception while the peak surge of inflation in 1974 is possibly a result of non-policy shocks. Third, models with commitment dominate models without commitment, especially in periods of large oscillations in inflation. In particular, when policymakers are committed to respond to a Taylor-type policy rule, the average loss function is considerably reduced over time, thus effectively lessening potential misperceptions. Chapter 4 introduces a simple version of <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectation</b> to a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to evaluate goodness of fitness and forecasting performance on U. S. macroeconomic indicators. Analytical maximum likelihood estimation results represent a DSGE model with <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectation</b> outperforms a DSGE model with rational expectation.

Postwar macro economy, a DSGE model with <b>adaptive</b> <b>expectation</b> also leads to redundant lagged inflation in fitting inflation dynamics.
