The two main objectives of this paper are: (1) to present an holistically designed ecological-economic model to evaluate farm and field-level environmental-economic tradeoffs with special reference to multi-objective policy-making and (2) to evaluate {{the impact of the}} Agenda 2000 reform on sustainability of organic farming. The model was implemented for the case of organic dairy farming in northern Tuscany (Italy). Minor {{differences were found between the}} environmental and technical results of the model under the MacSharry and Agenda 2000 reforms. However, gross margins under the Agenda 2000 regulations were considerably higher. The spatial detail of the model proved particularly useful in the evaluation of the impact of environmental sustainability thresholds. Sensitivity analysis indicated the weak environmental points of the farming system (in this case mainly soil erosion) and the feasible levels of the various environmental aspects and their associated socio-economic costs. The application of the model for alternative policy scenarios provided insights into ways in which the cost economic efficiency of the Agenda 2000 agri-environment support scheme could be improved. The paper concludes with suggestions for further model research to contribute to the design of cost-efficient <b>agri-environment</b> <b>payment</b> schemes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The hope among {{policy-makers}} {{and scientists}} alike is that conservation strategies {{designed to protect}} biodiversity also provide direct benefits to people by protecting other vital ecosystem services. The few studies that have examined the delivery of ecosystem services by existing conservation efforts have concentrated on large, ‘wilderness’-style biodiversity reserves. However, such reserves are not realistic options for densely populated regions. Here, we provide the first analyses that compare representation of biodiversity and three other ecosystem services across several contrasting conservation strategies in a human-dominated landscape (England). We show that small protected areas and protected landscapes (restrictive zoning) deliver high carbon storage and biodiversity, while existing incentive <b>payment</b> (<b>agri-environment)</b> schemes target areas that offer little advantage over other parts of England in terms of biodiversity, carbon storage and agricultural production. A fourth ecosystem service—recreation—is under-represented by all three strategies. Our findings are encouraging as they illustrate that restrictive zoning can {{play a major role}} in protecting natural capital assets in densely populated regions. However, trade-offs exist even among the four ecosystem services we considered, suggesting that a portfolio of conservation and sustainability investments will be needed to deliver both biodiversity and the other ecosystem services demanded by society...|$|R

An {{important part of this}} process is to establish the `value' of the nature-conservation assets within an area. This value can then be compared with data for other ecosystem services to identify management priorities under different future scenarios. However, there is little consensus on how to perform such an evaluation. In this study, we assess seven methods of valuing nature-conservation interest and compare their utility. Five agricultural land drainage schemes across lowland England were selected for study. The current land-use was determined and four different scenarios of future management were developed. The land-use and habitats predicted under each scenario were assessed using seven methods of determining value, namely: Ecological Impact Assessment method, reserve-selection criteria, target-based criteria, stakeholder-choice analysis, reserve-selection criteria guided by stakeholders, <b>agri-environment</b> scheme <b>payments</b> and contingent valuation. The first three methods derive values based on pre-defined priorities, the next two use stated preferences of stakeholders, and the last two methods derive monetary values based on revealed and expressed preference, respectively. The results obtained from the different methods were compared. The methods gave broadly similar results and were highly correlated, but each method emphasized a different aspect of conservation value, leading to different possible outcomes in some cases. The advantages and disadvantages of each method were evaluated. Synthesis and applications. As the ecosystem services approach becomes embedded in decision-making, ecologists are increasingly called upon to value the biodiversity of a site or to compare the value of different sites. This study has shown that seven different valuation methods, although all giving significantly correlated findings, resulted in seven different rankings of nature-conservation value for the 25 situations studied. This difference occurred in spite of the sites being of the same landscape type and occurring within the same country.

40|$|On file RONO: 00 The various {{financial}} analyses in {{this report}} all show that organic upland beef and sheep production results in a superior financial performance to comparable conventional businesses. The latest figures from the Defra-funded Organic Farm Incomes study show that net farm income (NFI) for organic upland beef and sheep businesses, at ? 174 /ha, is substantially higher than for comparable conventional businesses, at ? 93 /ha. Output tends to be higher on organic businesses, which have lower forage costs, but variable costs can also be higher. The optimistic picture of organic upland farming must however be tempered by the credit crunch, impacting on demand for organic meat, with lower differentials between organic and conventional prices. Therefore {{it is likely that}} the relatively favourable picture for the last two years will look less good in 2008 / 9. Organic holdings appear to be more profitable, but it must be noted that a higher proportion of their income is sourced not only from the Organic Farming Scheme, but also from <b>agri-environment</b> <b>payments</b> such as Tir Cynnal and Tir Gofal. Organic farming systems combine easily with the requirements of these agri-environment schemes, and to achieve maximum returns under organic farming they should be adopted. Analysis of the costs of production, or benchmarking, makes it clear that the sale price achieved for beef and sheep is still considerably below the total cost of production. Benchmarking continues to be an excellent resource in assessing the true costs of production, and highlights the need for further market development to ensure maximum returns from the marketplace. publishersversio...|$|E

To halt the decline, grassland conservation {{measures have been}} included in most European agri-environment schemes. This is the first study to compare the botanical composition of grassland habitats managed under the Irish Agri Environment Options Scheme (AEOS). Sixty fields on dry stock pastoral farms in receipt of <b>agri-environment</b> <b>payments</b> for grassland conservation were surveyed, with twenty fields being enrolled in each of the following AEOS options: Traditional Hay Meadow (THM), Species Rich Grassland (SRG) and Natura 2000 species rich grassland (Natura). The vegetation quality of sites enrolled in the Natura measure was higher than those enrolled in the THM and SRG measures. Natura sites had the greatest species richness with a mean > 40 species per site, which included approximately 17 species indicative of high botanical quality. Traditional Hay Meadow sites had the lowest species richness (mean 29 species per site) and were dominated by species associated with improved grassland. Some THM sites had good levels of botanical richness and were similar in composition to Natura sites, with some Natura sites having a lower vegetation quality, more similar to that of THM sites. Species Rich Grassland had a botanical richness that was intermediate between THM and Natura sites. A thorough assessment of the effectiveness of these measures was confounded by a lack of quantitative objectives for the target community composition to be attained. We discuss limitations and potential opportunities regarding the design, targeting, implementation and cost-effectiveness of these agri-environment measures. accepted for publicationTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|E

Assessing {{the options}} for upland {{livestock}} systems under CAP reform: Developing and applying a livestock systems model within whole-farm systems analysis. Agricultural Systems, 90, (1 - 3), 32 - 61. Sponsorship: SEERAD / DEFRAThis paper presents a scenario-based analysis of the impacts of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform for upland agriculture using a Welsh case-study. Specifically the paper examines the impacts of {{the introduction of the}} single-farm payment (SFP), the modulation of direct payments under Pillar I of the CAP and the increase in <b>agri-environment</b> <b>payments</b> under Pillar II. Three enterprises are examined, upland sheep rearing with lamb finishing, spring- and autumn-calving suckler-cattle with calf rearing. These enterprises are modelled under conditions in 2002 / 3, 2004 / 5 and for the reformed CAP in 2005 / 6. To support this analysis a livestock system model (LSM) was implemented. The model assesses alternative management regimen using a flexible state-transition approach. This simplifies the realisation and parameterisation of potentially complex management regimen. The model tracks fodder requirements to achieve targets based on defined diets. The LSM underpins whole-farm analyses of stocking-rates, labour and other resource requirements and net-farm income. From the case study the paper concludes that the impacts of the introduction of the CAP reform on the financial performance of the systems are small but negative (a net reduction of around 5 % in support). The larger reduction in direct payments (15 ? 18 %) is partially offset by agri-environment measures. The paper concludes that while SFP encourages a more market-oriented outlook, the adaptive capacity within systems as they stand is very limited. There are a range of possible adaptation strategies, but for the uplands the extensification of cattle systems by reducing stock numbers and cutting back on labour seems most probable.

40|$|This thesis {{applies the}} use of {{economic}} valuation techniques for valuing biodiversity focusing on production function approach. Biodiversity provides economic benefits, protects human health and offers food, food safety, recreational and aesthetic enjoyment. Biodiversity contributes to the economy through the provision of many ecosystem goods and services. However, many of the services provided by biodiversity are not traded in the marketplace so {{do not have an}} actual price or commercial value. Economics provides valuation techniques to help the decision-making process make better informed choices over trade-offs between biodiversity protection and livestock production and contribute to the management of biodiversity. This research aims to identify impacts, trade-offs and influencing factors that affect biodiversity, livestock productivity and environmental efficiency relating to biodiversity. Various econometric estimation techniques are used to find appropriate management solutions for biodiversity and livestock production. In what follows a brief outline of each chapter is provided. Chapter 2 determines factors affecting land abandonment. It examines the effects of different livestock grazing management on land abandonment amongst farms that manage commonage in the west of Ireland. It has been suggested that off-farm employment has {{played an important role in}} maintaining farmers in the Republic of Ireland (RoI). However, this results in farmers having less time to devote to farming activities and environmental stewardship; traditional practices such as mixed grazing, haymaking and commonage that frequently yield important public good benefits such as the provision biodiversity and landscape amenity may be abandoned. An ordered probit model is used to explain the probability of land abandonment. The results show that on-farm labour, livestock income and <b>agri-environment</b> scheme <b>payments</b> are found to reduce land abandonment whereas off-farm income, livestock costs and farmer age increases land abandonment. The risk of land abandonment is more likely to occur in suckler beef enterprises and least likely with mixed grazing. Findings indicate that mixed livestock systems may play an important role in preventing abandonment of commonage lands or by restoring damaged commonage lands in the Irish uplands. Chapter 3 investigates the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity and livestock productivity in the west of Ireland. This study uses a two-stage regression estimation procedure to estimate the relationship between biodiversity and livestock productivity. In the first stage, a Cob Douglas production function is used to investigate the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. In the second stage, a livestock production function is used to analyse the effects of habitat fragmentation on livestock productivity. The results show that habitat fragmentation is negatively correlated with biodiversity and livestock productivity. A specialisation in livestock grazing management has accelerated habitat loss and reduced biodiversity. On commonage lands, subsidies have positively influenced biodiversity in sheep farming whereas subsidies have no impact on biodiversity in mixed farming. In private lands, the results indicate slightly different findings. Subsidies are significantly and positively correlated with biodiversity in suckler beef and mixed farming. Empirical evidence suggests that a mixed grazing method was found to be the best management practice to improve biodiversity and livestock productivity. Mixed grazing management is found to be less vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and provides the highest total returns to livestock production compared to specialized livestock grazing management. It is, therefore, recommended that mixed livestock grazing should be better integrated into agri-environmental schemes such as the Rural Environment protection scheme (REPs) to conserve biodiversity and maintain productivity particularly for commonage. Chapter 4 considers to what degree efforts to enhance farm profitability compromises biodiversity conservation goals amongst livestock farmers in the west of Ireland. This paper aims to deliver empirical evidence on the links between environmental efficiency, biodiversity, and livestock management by analysing commonage farms in Ireland. The relationship between profit efficiency and Environmental Efficiency (EE) is examined comparing specialised versus mixed grazing farms; private versus commonage farmers; and full time versus part time farmers. A three-stage estimation procedure is employed. First, a stochastic biodiversity frontier function is used to estimate environmental efficiency. Second, a fixed effect stochastic profit frontier model is used to estimate profit efficiency. Finally, a truncated model is applied to estimate factors affecting the variation in environmental efficiency. The findings indicate that there is an inverse relationship between EE and profit. On commonage, there is a positive relationship between EE and stocking rate. Profitability and family labour have a negative impact on EE on private farms. On mixed farms, purchased feed decreases EE. However, stocking rate and the number of plots (land fragmentation) plays a positive role on EE. On specialised farms, environmental efficiency is negatively correlated with livestock profit, stocking rate, family labour, and subsidies whereas in mixed livestock farms environmental efficiency is negatively correlated with only purchased feed. However, there is no significant difference in EE between full-time and part-time farming...|$|R

The problem of the above issues was set out detailed in the comprehensive package of legislative proposals relates to supporting rural development, financing of agricultural policy and regulations on structural funds. The proposed changes of rural development are determined by several factors, in particular international context, height of the agricultural budget, the legislative changes introduced by Treaty of Lisbon and new global challenges, such a global warming, lack of energy sources, water shortage. It should be emphasized that new goals and priorities of rural development were set out in discussed legislative package. Furthermore the above sets out new legal measures regulating agricultural policy – aimed at promoting innovation, preventing adverse effects of climate change, increasing the share of renewable energy. In proposed arrangements, a far – reaching modifications of rural development policy’s instruments were set out, especially that which relates to <b>agri–environment</b> <b>payments</b> system (that is LFA payments). In connection with the appearance of various risks in the agriculture sector having natural, market and sanitary features, the legislative package also provides a new set of risk management legal instruments. Referring to the financial aspects of rural policy, it was pointed out to the fact that despite the planned extension of the scope of rural policy, current level of financial support for rural policy has been kept. This openes to doubts. It should be added that the increasing tendency of shifting the cost of financing the rural policy on national budgets, which in a single agricultural market will contribute to the diversification of the competitiveness of the agricultural sectors of each Member States of the EU – was also negatively assessed.

40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} Macedonia’s {{backbone}} for centuries {{and has always}} {{played an important role}} in Macedonian society. By maintaining landscape and biodiversity through the ages, Macedonian farmers have been the true guardians of an important national treasure – biodiversity. They have been the invisible hand managing landscapes, agricultural habitats and enabling farm-linked biodiversity to provide a range of ecosystem services. Pollination; pest, disease, flood and fire regulation; preservation of genetic resources; and the provision of food, fibre, natural medicine, pharmaceuticals and appealing landscapes are only a few of these services. Agricultural biodiversity under threat Many of the Macedonian landscapes and habitats that are important for conservation have been created by centuries-old practices of extensive grazing and low-input small-scale cropping practices. There is a very strong inter-linkage between farming, biodiversity and maintenance of traditional agricultural landscapes. However, depopulation of farming communities and their ageing, together with the introduction of agricultural machinery and intensive animal husbandry in fertile plains has drastically decreased the number of livestock in marginal areas. Most of these are mountainous regions with poor soils, but with species-rich grassland and other valuable ecosystems. Macedonian agriculture has also become “less mobile”. Traditional pastoral grazing systems, flocks and shepherds are nowadays more a tourist attraction than a common sight. A reduction of livestock density results in less moving and grazing, leading to land abandonment and changes in land use. The area of farmland of high natural value and the mosaic of habitats for wildlife in Macedonia has been shrinking due to an invasion by shrubs and other pioneering vegetation. This process results in the growth of coarse vegetation, leads to the development of semi-woody species and eventually closed canopy forests. Such ecosystems have substantially lower biodiversity value than fragmented agricultural landscapes, notably natural grassland. They harbour less bird, butterfly and plant species than managed grassland. Enhanced natural succession also causes a higher risk of fire because the excess biomass is not subject to grazing pressure. If not adequately addressed, the problem of land abandonment and natural succession in Macedonia will cause irreversible damage. The expansion of intensive agriculture in the lowlands is another threat to agricultural biodiversity. Land drainage, removal of hedges and other field margins, usage of pesticides and fertilisers are leading to a decline in agricultural biodiversity and provision of related ecosystem services. Agri-environment programmes promise vs. farmers’ reality The EU has introduced agri-environment programmes and payments to stop and to reverse these kinds of negative trends. In the accession process, Macedonia is required to design its own agri-environment programmes, compatible with the Common Agricultural Policy. These programmes encourage farmers to continue practising environmentally friendly measures or introduce those that are not economically attractive, but essential from the environmental and biodiversity point of view. <b>Agri-environment</b> <b>payments</b> are an instrument through which society rewards farmers for the public goods and services they provide, as the market does not recognise their values. However, Macedonian farmers have to be aware of this opportunity and to be prepared for benefiting from agri-environment programmes. For various historical, socio-economic, administrative, and other reasons, in Macedonia – as in some other countries – the human and social capital for administering and implementing agri-environment programmes is limited. The uptake in these programmes in Macedonia is likely to be slow and on a limited scale due to the following obstacles: 1. 	Farming in Macedonia, notably in high-nature-value areas is practiced predominantly by small-scale, (semi) -subsistence, elderly and poorly educated farmers. They have limited entrepreneurial skills, financial power and technical know-how. Besides, many operate in the most marginal areas (from an agriculturalist perspective) and under difficult weather conditions and socio-economic realities. 2. 	The majority of such farmers are outside of the mainstream economic and administrative systems. They produce mostly for themselves and their extended families, selling their surplus products locally for cash, without any receipts or VAT charged. They are not obliged to practice bookkeeping and are not subject to income tax. The farmland they use, especially grasslands – as well as their livestock is rarely included in the Land and other Registers. These farmers are the “outlaws” of the official systems and as such are not eligible for EU area-based support schemes such as <b>agri-environment</b> <b>payments.</b> Those few such farmers who would like to become a part of the official systems and register their land and livestock, face complicated, unresolved land ownership and land use issues – sometimes going back several generations. 3. 	Products (cheese, milk, “kashkaval”, salami, etc.) that are produced in a traditional way do not necessarily meet the respective national or newly harmonised EU sanitary, veterinary or hygiene standards, making their sale through mainstream marketing channels virtually impossible. 4. 	<b>Agri-environment</b> <b>payments</b> compensate for additional costs and/or income foregone associated with the implementation of the respective measures. But they do not fully take into account negative agricultural externalities and reward farmers for positive externalities by providing them an additional incentive – an extra, above the costs occurred and/or income foregone. 5. 	Very few Macedonian farmers have agricultural or education in nature conservation. A vast majority relies only on practical experience and tradition; and they are not sufficiently aware of the ecosystem services they provide and their value for society as a whole. For most of them farming is not their deliberate choice but an inevitable job – a survival strategy. Many of them are likely to perceive agri-environment as an externally imposed concept that has little to do with their harsh reality and their priorities. Environmental NGOs can help to remove barriers preventing a better uptake of agri-environment programmes The above-mentioned issues are serious obstacles for the enrolment in agri-environment programmes. However, examples from EU Member States facing similar problems, notably Romania, Bulgaria and some Mediterranean countries show that barriers preventing uptake in agri-environment schemes can be removed if a creative approach is applied and social consensus reached. Building farmers’ capacities by providing them various forms of technical and administrative assistance and by setting up an appropriate legislative framework, social/institutional structures and facilities can increase farmers’ participation in agri-environment programmes. The feasibility of establishing various forms and institutional settings for collective agri-environment schemes can be explored. In this case a group of small-scale farmers can jointly apply for <b>agri-environment</b> <b>payments</b> (e. g. by setting up a co-operative or through the help of the municipality, etc). Taking part in a collective agri-environment scheme would not only relieve individual farmers from administrative burdens. It is also likely to be more effective and more profitable. Moreover, in many cases, this might be the only way for small-scale farmers to benefit from <b>agri-environment</b> <b>payments.</b> Environmental NGOs can play a vital role in assisting both farmers and society to understand high-nature value farming and agri-environment programmes. Their members are often well educated, enthusiastic young experts who will potentially over time evolve into opinion leaders and/or decision makers. Environmental NGOs can act as catalysts between farmers, policy makers and society. By increasing understanding, informing and educating various stakeholders they can reinforce farmers’ position and create a win-win situation for all social groups. Environmental NGOs can work on informing both farmers and citizens why it is important to protect biodiversity and how this can benefit them. Protection of biodiversity can only succeed if all stakeholders actively understand and support the conservation vision and objectives set by agri-environment programmes. Policy makers should create an enabling environment for this to happen and NGOs can significantly influence them. However, as policy makers often tend to neglect the needs of small farmers – at the expense of “big producers” – environmental NGOs can act as their guardians and make policy makers and civil society more aware about the "hidden" values they provide. Society often tends to develop an attitude of underestimation towards people living in marginal rural areas. Many people – not only in Macedonia – still think that only “losers” choose to live in these areas, i. e. only those who are not “good” or “competent” enough to find their place elsewhere. The attitude that farming is an occupation chosen by those who are not capable or who are not able to do anything else still prevails today. However, those who have that kind of attitude tend to forget that their economic prosperity and welfare is also due to the hard work of those living in remote rural areas and providing the ecosystem services mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter. Environmental NGOs can lobby to put these kinds of issues higher on the political agenda. Through information dissemination, awareness raising, education, demonstration projects, campaigns, etc., they can enlighten citizens and policy makers about the importance of (agricultural) biodiversity and the ecosystem services provided by marginalised farmers. Besides, NGOs can also serve as watchdogs securing that legislation aiming at protecting agricultural biodiversity is put in place and enforced. Further, NGOs can build networks, coalitions and alliances of like-minded individuals and organizations. They can establish a forum of different yet commonly concerned actors and initiate dialogues across differing perspectives and players. The strengthening of social and human capital in order to ensure a smooth and large-scale uptake of agri-environment measures in Macedonia is a long-term and complex process. It requires understanding and co-operation between relevant stakeholders, a constant exchange of information and capacity building. (Small-scale) Macedonian farmers can continue providing the ecosystem services that are so vital to society only if society is willing to reward them for their hard and honest work. Environmental NGOs are there to help and facilitate that process. This very project has paved the road to a long-lasting partnership between Macedonian farmers, environmental NGOs and policy makers. ...|$|E
40|$|European Union {{policies}} {{relevant to}} the environment evolved from addressing a single concern and environmental component, often restricted to target areas, to overarching policies, addressing {{different aspects of the}} same environmental domain or even including policies with multiple objectives. Under the first generation, some directives directly regulate the discharge of (potentially) harmful substances into water and soil, whereas others target biotic resources, but have nevertheless positive implications for soil and water. Along with these developments, some environmental provisions were incorporated into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Since the 1990 s, coinciding with the introduction and development of the EU Treaty, the environmental scope has been widened from protecting the environment against negative externalities to maintaining and even improving environmental quality. The Water Framework Directive and the proposed Soil Framework Directive are examples of overarching policies that bring together, and fill gaps in the existing suite of policies. Alongside, the CAP integrated existing policies (statutory management requirements) and (further) developed a range of provisions for environmental quality. Under cross compliance rules, farmers¿ receipt of the single farm payment and payments for eight rural development measures are conditional on their compliance with a set of standards, some of which are environmental. The requirement to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition for example directly targets aspects of soil and water quality. Despite variations and difficulties, early signs about the overall effectiveness of cross compliance have been positive. In general, cross compliance has increased farmers¿ awareness of soil degradation, as well as the environmental reasons for introducing standards to prevent it. Rural development policy offers options to the member states or regions for encouraging farmers to go beyond the reference level of soil and water quality (established by the cross compliance standards). <b>Agri-environment</b> <b>payments</b> in particular enable direct targeting of soil and water aspects. Evaluation of their effectiveness has so far been piece-meal, as details on the effect of farming practices on specific soil degradation processes can only be obtained at the level of policy implementation. Results of a cross-policy survey on implementation of EU, national and regional policies for soil and water conservation are presented. However, information on policy implementation for soil and water conservation in the European Union remains fragmented. JRC. DDG. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E

Although the main aim {{of the project was}} to build the capacity of civil society organizations in the Republic of Macedonia on the importance of HNV farming, it also has involved carrying out case studies on the occurrence of and issues facing HNV farming systems in three different regions in the country - Lacavica, Mariovo and Rekanski. The main findings of the case studies have been presented to the farmers and responsible institutions and are also presented in this handbook. The publication is intended to serve different stakeholders in the agricultural and rural development sector including policy and decision makers, regional authorities and services, non-governmental and scientific organizations addressing social, environmental and agricultural issues and the inter-linkages between them. The book is therefore produced in both the Macedonian and English language and {{can be used as a}} reference for future programming in the rural development sector in the country. Chapter 1 of the publication examines the impact of current agricultural practices on the environment in the country. Chapter 2 then outlines the concept of HNV farming in the EU and its development over the time. A first attempt to develop a typology of HNV farming systems in the Republic of Macedonia and the case study areas, along with indicative maps of their distribution are found in Chapter 3. The needs of the HNV farmers and the main problems they face, as identified through the workshops, discussions and face to face meetings with them are presented in Chapter 4 and the link between HNV farming and social capital is further elaborated in Chapter 5. The hidden values of HNV farming systems are also presented in Chapter 6. In order make the project results as useful as possible, proposals for agri-environmental type measures that could support HNV farming in the Republic of Macedonia were developed. The measures proposed are intended to complement the existing proposal for the NAEP of the Republic of Macedonia and to respond to the needs of the farmers in rural areas as a whole, and the case studies areas in particular. These proposals are presented in Chapter 5. ...|$|E
