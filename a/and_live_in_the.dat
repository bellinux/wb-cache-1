5|$|Feral {{horses are}} born <b>and</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist {{throughout}} the world.

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage <b>and</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shelter of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants are {{generally}} intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) {{living in their}} colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as discussed earlier, some are inquilines <b>and</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest commensally. Unused or abandoned areas inside colonies are sometimes occupied by other species of ants and in some cases, termites. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify.|$|E

5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus {{to take a}} break to spend time with their {{families}} before starting to compile Everything in Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and Boom Box, a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, Everything in Time, The Videos 1992–2003 <b>and</b> <b>Live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tragic Kingdom, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E

25|$|The Forest Rights Act {{passed by}} the Indian {{government}} in 2006 grants some of India's most impoverished communities the right to own <b>and</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forests, which likely brings them into conflict with wildlife and under-resourced, under-trained, ill-equipped forest department staff.
