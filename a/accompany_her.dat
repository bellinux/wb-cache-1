5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes <b>accompany</b> <b>her</b> blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets.
