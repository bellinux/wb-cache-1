His essay [...] "About Conducting" [...] (1869) advanced Hector Berlioz's technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was {{a means by which}} a musical work could be re-interpreted, rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison. He exemplified this approach in his own conducting, which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of Felix Mendelssohn; in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon, such as the rewriting of scores. Wilhelm Furtwängler felt that Wagner and Bülow, through their interpretative approach, inspired <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> of conductors (including Furtwängler himself).|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This study {{explores the}} ways in which teachers’ biographies shape the act of teaching. It {{illuminates}} the formative (emotional, private, personal and professional) influences and experiences in teachers’ lives and work. After offering a detailed examination of the most significant ‘players’ (teachers’ educational beliefs, emotional connection and/or emotional knowledge of the subject matter; context and history syllabi) co-performing with the history teacher, the study then specifically focuses on the intersections between teachers’ emotional and personal history; their emotional knowledge and orientation to the subject matter; their pedagogical choices and the contexts (the type of school and in particular the subject’s locations in that school) within which they teach. The research is inter-disciplinary and is premised upon theoretical and empirical studies in: teaching history, historical empathy, teaching the Holocaust, biography, modalities of teachers’ knowledge, emotion in education, teachers’ educational beliefs and context. It is a qualitative multiple-case study of 20 teachers working in 15 disparate schools and subject locations. The qualitative empirical materials gathered for the study have allowed single and cross-case comparisons to be made within the study through examining both the individual and collective meanings that teachers bring to their work. Once this information is interpreted, a clearer picture emerges of what it is that history teachers regard as being most influential in affecting their choice of content or even their orientation to their subject matter. By discovering the emotional, private and personal dimensions of teachers’ knowledge (an area which has to date been virtually unrecognised and/or acknowledged), this study has not only added to existing knowledge, but it has invited inquiry into <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> area—second <b>generation</b> emotional knowledge (SGEK). This is a dimension of emotional knowledge that is unique and, as yet, uncharted...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{identification}} and characterization of two M. tuberculosis-specific antigens (ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10) {{has led to}} the development of <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> blood <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> of M. tuberculosis specific diagnostic tests, that have several advantages over tuberculin skin test (TST), in terms of higher specificity, better correlation with surrogate measures of exposure to M. tuberculosis in low-incidence setting, and less cross-reactivity with M. bovis (BCG) vaccine and environmental mycobacteria. The role of these new tests in evaluating post-therapy tuberculosis eradication has not been investigated yet. Aim of this longitudinal study was to determinate changes of response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens in patients during the standard tuberculosis treatment and to investigate the in vitro effects of tuberculosis drugs on the IFN-γ release. Methods: 23 individuals with active tuberculosis were enrolled and followed over time. They were tested with QuantiFERON TB-Gold (QFT-Gold) at four time points: at diagnosis (t 0), after 3 and 6 months of treatment (t 1 - t 2) and at the end of the specific treatment (t 3). Results: At baseline all patients were positive by QFT-Gold. At second time-point 17 out of 23 (74 %) were positive, at third time-point 11 of 23 (47 %) were positive, at treatment completion 3 / 23 (13 %) were positive. The conversion to negative response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens was found in 87 % patients analyzed after successful therapy. Longitudinal QFT-Gold testing shown a significant decrease (p< 0. 001) of IFN-γ response during the therapy. No inhibitory effect on IFN-γ release was noted in vitro for chemotherapy using at concentrations compatible with those achieved in serum of treated patients. We have revealed an inhibitory effect only at concentrations 2 - 3 times greater than those previously tested. Conclusion: A successful therapy for tuberculosis causes a significant decrease of the ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 response and this data suggest that the QTF-Gold assay may have a role as a tool for evaluating tuberculosis eradication after standard tuberculosis treatment...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> of <b>generation</b> of Pistons and Lakers {{would meet}} as they squared off {{again in the}} 2004 NBA Finals. Los Angeles {{originally}} entered the 2003-04 NBA season {{on a mission to}} win the championship, due to a multi-talented roster featuring 4 NBA superstars: Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone. Despite trying to meet high expectations and getting off to a promising start, the Lakers suffered through injuries and turmoil throughout the campaign; Malone struggled with a knee injury which he had to have surgery on, and was limited to playing only 42 games. Payton never grew comfortable learning the nuances of head coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense. Finally, O'Neal and Bryant spent the whole season feuding over who was a more valuable player for the Lakers. Nevertheless, Los Angeles finished with a 56-26 record, winning the Pacific Division title {{on the last day of}} the season. Next, the Lakers eliminated the Houston Rockets, San Antonio Spurs, and Minnesota Timberwolves to win the Western Conference crown. The Pistons also struggled through the early part of their season as well. However, their fortunes soon improved vastly thanks to the February acquisition of Rasheed Wallace via trade, and the firm guidance of head coach Larry Brown. Detroit finished with a 54-28 record. Then, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, and Indiana Pacers en route to the Eastern Conference title. Just like they had in both 1988 & 1989, the Lakers entered the NBA Finals as the clear favorite to win the championship. Still, the Pistons were not discouraged by their underdog status, stunning Los Angeles with a Game 1 win in L.A. The Lakers pulled out an overtime victory over Detroit in Game 2, thanks to Bryant's game-tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation, enabling L.A. to eventually tie the series. However, as the series shifted to Detroit, the Pistons imposed their will on the Lakers. Their commitment to team basketball and tough, physical defense proved to be insurmountable. L.A.'s title dreams were dashed when Malone reinjured his knee in Game 4, and was unable to suit up for the Lakers in Game 5. The Pistons convincingly won the next 3 games at the Palace of Auburn Hills, and won the series 4-1, capturing their 3rd NBA title overall. At the end of the series, Al Michaels, who was serving as the play-by-play announcer for the NBA on ABC during the finals, observed that even though the Lakers had Hall of Fame players, the Pistons beat L.A. by using players that nobody else wanted. Chauncey Billups, the Pistons' point guard, won the NBA Finals MVP Award. Billups became the first Finals MVP recipient since former Pistons star (and current Pistons GM) Joe Dumars to have won the award before making his first NBA All-Star team. Like Dumars, Billups would eventually go on to make multiple appearances in the NBA All-Star Game.|$|R
