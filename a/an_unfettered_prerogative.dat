60|$|This is {{essentially}} a people's contest.

50|$|The {{political}} {{pressure of the}} ideologically charged civil war, {{in conjunction with the}} excruciating need for aid and funds to finance imports, compelled FRELIMO to negotiate its first structural adjustment package (SAP) with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1986 (commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods Institutions or International Financial Institutions—IFIs). The series of SAPs that followed thereafter, required privatization of major industries, less government spending, deregulation of the economy, and trade liberalization. The SAPs, therefore, have essentially focused on the implementation of <b>an</b> <b>unfettered</b> free market economy.|$|R

40|$|The author {{describes}} a {{model with a}} corrupt banking system, in which bankers knowingly lend at market interest rates to back projects riskier than the market rate indicates. Faced with early withdrawals, bankers turn to an interbank market, which may be available in <b>an</b> <b>unfettered</b> way, available but subject to screening, or unavailable. The presence of corruption increases the probability of contagious bank failure significantly. This fact holds in a perfect information environment, {{as well as in}} some environments with imperfect information. The model suggests that financial stability can be imperilled by corrupt lending.

50|$|Although Caryl Churchill’s {{first play}} for radio, The Ants (produced by Michael Bakewell), was {{broadcast}} {{three times in}} 1962-63, it was not retained in the BBC Archives. For Churchill, as for Stoppard, {{the freedom of the}} radio form was significant in the development of their writing. Churchill’s work with Tydeman shows <b>an</b> <b>unfettered</b> imagination at work. The plays Identical Twins, Shreber’s Nervous Illness, Henry’s Past, Abortive, Not, Not, Not, Not, Not Enough Oxygen and Perfect Happiness do survive in the BBC, and foreshadow the freedom and discipline of her later stage work. Kenneth Haigh’s performance as twin brothers in Identical Twins, a ‘duologue’, is a tour-de-force of radio acting and writing.|$|R
50|$|Brand had {{a phenomenal}} {{literary}} success, and people became {{curious to know}} what Ibsen's next play would be. The dramatist, about this time, was relieved of financial worry by two money grants, one from the Norwegian government and the other from the Scientific Society of Trondhjem. This enabled him to give to his work <b>an</b> <b>unfettered</b> mind. He went {{with his family to}} Frascati, where, in the Palazzo rooms, he looked many feet down upon the Mediterranean, and pondered his new drama. He preserved a profound silence about the content of the play, and begged his publisher, Hegel, to create as much mystery about it as possible.|$|R
50|$|A core {{teaching}} of the Bahá'í Faith is <b>an</b> <b>unfettered</b> search for the truth. Another core {{teaching of}} the Bahá'í Faith is that science and religion should agree and not be opposed to each other (see the religion's views on science and religion.) As in other religions, it is held that having a firm belief itself can make seemingly impossible things possible, even natural. Being disciplined about this search for truth {{can be seen as}} a philosophy, and the literature of the religion sometimes praises philosophers. According to the Bahá'i Faith, the object of all learning is to achieve the presence of God in one's life, and thereby to know ourselves.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a very general test for "monopoly. " Using standard comparative statics analysis, the authors derive testable {{restrictions on the}} firm's reduced-form revenue equation which must be satisfied by any profit-maximizing firm whose choices are not affected by either strategic interactions or the threat of entry. For such <b>an</b> <b>unfettered</b> monopolist, {{the sum of the}} factor price elasticities of the reduced-form revenue equation must be nonpositive. The set of interesting alternative hypotheses is not empty. The authors develop simple models of oligopolistic, competitive, and monopolistically-competitive markets for which this test statistic may take on positive values.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess whether {{competition}} agencies (“CAs”) do, and in turn should, enjoy <b>an</b> <b>unfettered</b> discretionary power in the context of the investigation of competition law infringements or whether their margin of discretion should be subject to certain limits. To this end, it focuses on four successive areas where CAs may be entitled to make choices, i. e. detection of infringements, selection of enforcement targets, initiation of infringement proceedings and outcome of the case. Thanks to reports received from 21 national experts in response to a questionnaire covering 18 jurisdictions, the present study formulates a number of public policy proposals. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Erlewine commented the album [...] "showcases a band who doesn't know its own attributes, and that's why it's worthwhile: it's {{the sound of a}} band discovering its own strengths".
