40|$|AbstractBiaxial <b>flexure</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been}} used {{extensively}} for the strength measurements of monolithic brittle materials. However, despite the increasing applications of multilayered structures, characterization of their strengths using biaxial <b>flexure</b> <b>tests</b> is unavailable. This is because the analytical description {{of the relation between}} the strength and the fracture load for multilayers subjected to biaxial <b>flexure</b> <b>tests</b> is nonexistent. To characterize the biaxial strength of multilayers, an analytical model is developed in the present study to derive the general closed-form solutions for the elastic stress distributions in thin multilayered disks subjected to biaxial <b>flexure</b> <b>tests.</b> To verify the analytical solutions, finite element analyses are performed on trilayered disks subjected to ring-on-ring tests. Good agreement is obtained between analytical and numerical results. The present closed-form solutions hence provide a basis for evaluating the biaxial strength of multilayered systems. Depending upon the strength of the individual layers and the stress distribution through the thickness of the multilayer during testing, cracking can initiate from any layer under tension...|$|R

The thesis investigates the faults and omissions of existing work and judges today's requirements thereby constructing a framework with which today's and future standards in <b>flexure</b> <b>testing</b> can be based. The draft standard presented in this thesis covers the three major testing methods for determining the biaxial flexural strength (modulus of rupture) of engineering ceramics. The ring-on-ring, ball-on-ring, and 4 -Ball test fixtures were all adopted as standard, since it is known that each of these systems is suited for a particular application and each has different advantages and disadvantages. The three major biaxial test methods prescribed in this draft standard have been devised so that more consistent and accurate test results can be obtained. However, the uncertainty of measurement in <b>flexure</b> <b>testing</b> always exists and needs to be estimated. The estimation of uncertainty in <b>flexure</b> <b>testing</b> in this study is based on the methodology provided in the ISO Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. The results of the estimation showed that the uncertainty in measurement for the biaxial <b>flexure</b> <b>test</b> standard proposed in this thesis is very low compared to the inherent variability of the strength of ceramic materials. It was also found that the applied load, thickness of the disc plate, and random effects are the three major components contributing to the overall uncertainty. The total uncertainty of measurement in biaxial <b>flexure</b> <b>testing</b> can be significantly minimised by the reduction of the uncertainty contributed from these components, especially from random effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify possible test procedures for the evaluation of the strength of chewable tablets with respect to prevention of damage to teeth or mandibular joints when tablets are consumed. Diametral compression and <b>flexure</b> <b>tests</b> were employed to evaluate the strength of commercial samples from five manufacturers of chewable vitamin C tablets. Weibull analysis was used to assess the brittleness of these tablets. The tablets had a lower tensile strength value when determined by the diametral compression test compared to the <b>flexure</b> <b>test</b> ratio which ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 4. The value for the Weibull modulus ranged from 5 to 16, indicating an appreciable degree of brittleness of the samples. Relating the values for the mechanical strength to suggested practical values for the prevention of damage to the teeth or the mandibular joints indicated that most tablets exceeded these values. The <b>flexure</b> <b>test</b> reflects the practical situation closest, and a limiting tensile strength value of 2 MPa should not be exceeded for chewable tablets. The tablet batches tested were also characterized by a large batch-to-batch variability, suggesting uncontrolled manufacturing procedures. Commercially distributed chewable vitamin C tablets could provide a possible health hazard to teeth and mandibular joints. This hazard could be limited by a mechanical strength test specification...|$|R

METHODS: With 10 different veneering ceramics for zirconia (test group) and three different veneering ceramics for the metal-ceramic technique (control group) three-point flexural strength and biaxial flexural strength according to ISO 6872 : 1995 {{as well as}} four-point flexural strength according to EN 843 - 1 : 2005 were measured (n= 10). Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA and post hoc Scheffé test (SPSS, p< 0. 05). RESULTS: For the test group, three-point flexural strength ranged between 77. 8 +/- 8. 7 and 106. 6 +/- 12. 5 MPa without any statistically significant differences, biaxial flexural strength between 69. 1 +/- 4. 8 and 101. 4 +/- 10. 5 MPa with three homogeneous groups and four-point flexural strength between 59. 5 +/- 6. 2 and 89. 2 +/- 9. 5 MPa with five homogeneous groups. The control group showed three-point flexural strength values ranging from 93. 3 +/- 13. 5 to 149. 4 +/- 20. 5 MPa, biaxial flexural strength values from 93. 4 +/- 10. 0 to 141. 2 +/- 11. 6 MPa, and four-point flexural strength values from 82. 7 +/- 8. 5 to 116. 9 +/- 9. 8 MPa. In every case, {{the results of the}} four-point <b>flexure</b> <b>test</b> were significantly lower than those obtained in the three-point <b>flexure</b> <b>test.</b> The three-point flexural strengths of the test group {{are similar to those of}} two ceramics of the control group.

The beam was subjected to vertical point loading at {{the centre of the}} longer span. Mid-span deflections, support rotations and outer surface flange strains recorded during major- and minor-axis <b>flexure</b> <b>tests</b> on the beam are presented and shown to be both repeatable and linear. New closed-form shear deformation equations are presented for the forces and displacements of two-span continuous beams of arbitrary span ratio with the longer span subjected to a vertical mid-span point load. The equations have been used to predict the mid-span deflections, support rotations and surface strains recorded during the <b>flexure</b> <b>tests.</b> It is shown that the equations are able to predict the experimental deflections accurately. Depending on the particular support, the rotations (particularly the minor-axis rotations) are slightly under/over-estimated and, in general, the surface strains are over-estimated.

This can be explained by the evolution of damage in the material under the experiments and damage was not included in the present model. The simulations of the bending tests had a weaker response compared to the experiments for both three- and four-point bending.

Static bending properties were determined and failure initiation mechanism was deduced from experimental observations. Failure mode of the tested hybrid RTM-made I-beams can be reckoned to be characteristic of the delamination from the cutout edge within the web and the debonding propagation along the interface between the inverted triangular resin-rich zone and the adjacent curved web until local buckling within the curved webs around the conjunction fillet region.
