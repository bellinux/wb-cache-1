You know, when we hear a concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feel for the song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E

6000|$|Well, he run on, and on, and on, {{making up}} stuff about Hicksville and {{everybody}} in it he could invent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> little nervious, <b>and</b> wondering how {{this was going to}} help me out of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off {{with the back of her}} hand, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it isn't a {{bad trip}} on the boat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> change from New York; and see men I shouldn't {{probably}} see otherwise." [...] He paused {{and looked at her}} again, doubtfully. [...] "Why do you ask such a question?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thought I'd {{look you}} up, old thing," [...] he said. [...] "Not {{much chance of}} a powwow at Russell Square. As soon as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> word together, that chap Hartwell comes butting in, or else Phil Mason has a bundle of {{prospectuses}} to show you. What-ho the giddy night club! What-ho the Trinidad Oil Wells!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bully," [...] said Pescud, {{brightening}} at once. [...] "I've had {{my salary}} raised twice since I saw you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> commission, too. I've bought a neat slice {{of real estate}} out in the East End, and have run up a house on it. Next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock. Oh, I'm in on the line of General Prosperity, no matter who's elected!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, David, we {{have every}} book and {{pamphlet}} catalogued. And I am adding something new," [...] continued the professor. [...] "I am getting the autographs {{of many of the}} writers and pasting them on the fly-leaves. And where a writer dies <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> printed obituary notice I paste that {{in the back of the}} book. I think it adds something to a volume to know about the writer and to have his or her autograph." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} got a lawyer, {{and he would have}} said (as I have often read in the newspapers), 'My client says nothing, my client {{reserves}} his defence': my client this, that, and t'other. Well, 'tis not the custom of that breed to go straight, according to my opinion, or to think that other men do. Say I am innocent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lawyer. He would be as likely to believe me guilty as not; perhaps more. What would he do, whether or not? Act as if I was--shut my mouth up, tell me not to commit myself, keep circumstances back, chop the evidence small, quibble, and get me off perhaps! But, Miss Summerson, do I care for getting off in that way; or would I rather be hanged in my own way--if you'll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a lady?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 4. The banging and bumping of the {{carriages}} {{over the}} turn-tables wakes me up as I am beginning to doze, at Fontainebleau, {{and again at}} Sens; and the trilling and thrilling of the little telegraph bell establishes itself in my ears, and stays there, trilling me at last into a shivering, suspicious sort of sleep, which, with a few vaguely fretful shrugs and fidgets, carries me as far as Tonnerre, where the 'quinze minutes d'arret' revolutionize everything; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> turn or two on the platform, and perhaps {{a glimpse of the}} stars, with promise of a clear morning; and so generally keep awake past Mont Bard, remembering the happy walks one used to have on the terrace under Buffon's tower, and thence watching, if perchance, {{from the mouth of the}} high tunnel, any film of moonlight may show the far undulating masses of the hills of Citeaux. But most likely one knows the place where the great old view used to be only by the sensible quickening of the pace as the train turns down the incline, and crashes through the trenched cliffs into the confusion and high clattering vault of the station at Dijon.|$|E
6000|$|... --Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm {{hanging on}} to his taw now for the past {{fortnight}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> penny out of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, lots of things! Buy {{books and}} clothes for school, <b>and,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> great deal, give some to granny. I'd {{love to do}} that, for she takes care of me, and I'd be so proud to help her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do. My son James {{who helps}} me is sick in Philadelphia, <b>and</b> {{consequently}} <b>I</b> have only the errand boy to relieve me. It {{is too much}} for me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>a</b> clerk." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{turning to}} Edie, he endeavoured {{to put money}} into his hand. [...] "I think," [...] said Edie, as he {{tendered}} it back again, [...] "the hale folk here have either gane daft, or they hae made a vow to rain my trade, as they say ower muckle water drowns the miller. I hae had mair gowd offered me within this twa or three weeks than I ever saw in my life afore.

60|$|He just begins another question, {{and then}} he catches my eye and stops and goes away to obtain some gloves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{breathing}} space. But why do they keep on with this cross-examination? If I knew exactly what I wanted--description, price, size--I should not go to a shop at all, it would save me such {{a lot of trouble}} just to send a cheque to the Stores. The only reason why I go into a tradesman's shop is because I don't know what I want exactly, am in doubt about the name or the size, or the price, or the fashion, and want a specialist to help me. The only reason for having shopmen instead of automatic machines is that one requires help in buying things. When I want gloves, the shopman ought to understand his business sufficiently well to know better than I do what particular kind of gloves I ought to be wearing, and what is a fair price for them. I don't see why I should teach him what is in fashion and what is not. A doctor does not ask you what kind of operation you want and what price you will pay for it. But I really believe these outfitter people would let me run about London wearing white cotton gloves and a plaid comforter without lifting a finger to prevent me.|$|E
6000|$|... 76. I {{feel much}} {{inclined}} to pause at this point, {{to answer the}} kind of questions and objections which I know must be rising in your mind, respecting the authority supposed to be lodged in the persons of the officers just specified. But I can neither define, nor justify to you, the powers I would desire to see given to them, till I state to you the kind of laws {{they would have to}} enforce: of which the first group should be directed to the prevention of all kinds of thieving; but chiefly of the occult and polite methods of it; and, of all occult methods, chiefly, the making and selling of bad goods. No form of theft is so criminal as this--none so deadly to the State. If you break into a man's house and steal a hundred pounds' worth of plate, he knows his loss, and there is an end (besides that you take your risk of punishment for your gain, like a man). And if you do it bravely and openly, and habitually live by such inroad, you may retain nearly every moral and manly virtue, and become a heroic rider and reiver, and hero of song. But if you swindle me out of twenty shillings' worth of quality on each of a hundred bargains, I lose my hundred pounds all the same, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hundred untrustworthy articles besides, which will fail me and injure me in all manner of ways, when I least expect it; and you, having done your thieving basely, are corrupted by the guilt of it to the very heart's core.|$|E
60|$|Then George spoke up. He said Harris <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>an</b> hotel {{built for}} us, if we liked, {{and have some}} people made to put in. For his part, he {{was going back to}} the Stag.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may as well}} {{go before}} as after, for I could not go home after that. Thank you, Fred, with all my heart; I will take your money and advice, <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> rich man <b>I</b> will pay you again. Are the fellows in bed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, well, sir," [...] he said, [...] "you've {{turned up}} at last, have you? I send you off with papers for <b>a</b> man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back <b>a</b> piece of yellow paper saying that he's {{borrowed}} you. What did he do with you, Mr. Brice?" ...|$|R

5000|$|An 'error' is a {{deviation}} from accuracy or correctness. A 'mistake' is an error {{caused by a}} fault: the fault being misjudgment, carelessness, or forgetfulness. Now, say that I run a stop sign because I was in a hurry, and wasn't concentrating, and the police stop me, that is a mistake. If, however, I try to park in an area with conflicting signs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> ticket because I was incorrect on my interpretation of what the signs meant, {{that would be an}} error. The first time it would be an error. The second time {{it would be a mistake}} since I should have known better.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{withdrawal}} Brownlee stated [...] "I suspect few New Zealanders knew {{the country had}} such considerable mineral potential before we undertook this process, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sense that New Zealanders are now much more aware of that potential". He went on that it might contribute to economic growth and further stated that [...] "New Zealanders have given the minerals sector a clear mandate to go and explore that land, and where appropriate, within {{the constraints of the}} resource consent process, utilise its mineral resources for everyone's benefit". An additional announcement from Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson pronounced that future National Park land would receive protections, stating that, [...] "This is an added layer of protection for New Zealand's most highly valued conservation land..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You've been {{neglecting}} things here, Mangan," [...] he complained. [...] "You {{ought to}} have come down and exorcised that ghost.

6000|$|... "I've {{a notion}} that we're up against the meanest kind of toughs, {{but in the long}} run I'll back dad," [...] he said. [...] "It's quite likely that if we lie low you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> may <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hand in later on." ...|$|R

5000|$|Frances {{has played}} the role of Morag on and off for twenty-nine years. During flashbacks to the character's past, Morag was portrayed by Eve Kelman, Vanessa Goddard and Pheobe Taylor-Bush respectively. After an eight-year hiatus, in 2001 it was {{announced}} that Frances had returned to the serial and Morag would be [...] "more evil" [...] than ever. In 2002 Frances again returned to the serial. In 2008, Frances signed another six-month contract with the serial. She also revealed that fans miss her when she is absent. Discussing this, Frances said [...] "I really adore playing her <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of people saying 'when are you coming back?" [...] Of her return Frances said [...] "I've played Morag for so long that I have no trouble slipping back into character. I know her so well." ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 2009, it was {{announced}} that Jay Laga'aia had been cast into the serial to play Elijah Johnson, a new local reverend and a new potential love interest for Leah. [...] Nicodemou expressed her delight over Leah's romance with Elijah when she started ji jitsui classes to build her confidence. Speaking to Sunrise she stated: [...] "There's a whole lot of love in the Bay <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> love interest. It's nice and it's really fun and happy and comedy - a lot of warm and fuzzy moments. It's Jay Laga'aia and I'm loving working with him as well. It's all happy times ahead. We're moving away from the darker storylines into lighter stuff." [...] When their relationship ends, Leah begins dating Robert Robertson (Socratis Otto), however, Nicodemou said that she believed that Leah was still in love with Elijah.|$|E
