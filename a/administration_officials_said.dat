5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of the Green Line was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 {{million a year for}} four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration said that it would cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> WMATA had more than enough money to complete the Green Line. Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the Green Line into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E

A review of Shahzad's phone call records revealed that he had received a series of calls from Pakistan directly before and after he purchased the Pathfinder. Investigators also examined international phone records showing calls [...] "between {{some of the people}} who might be associated with this and folks overseas," [...] according to a U.S. official. According to The Wall Street Journal, Shahzad received bomb-making training from the Pakistani Taliban. On May 6, The New York Times, quoting various American officials, said that evidence was mounting that Shahzad's alleged attempt was tied to the Taliban.|$|E

2500|$|As OMB {{director}} from May 2006 to August 2007, Portman {{helped to}} craft a $2.9 trillion budget for fiscal year 2008. The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that [...] "The plan called for making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, {{at a cost of}} more than $500 billion over the five-year life of the proposal. It requested a hefty increase in military spending, along with reductions in low-income housing assistance, environmental initiatives, and health care safety-net programs." [...] Portman {{is said to have been}} [...] "frustrated" [...] with the post, calling the budget that President Bush's office sent to Congress, [...] "not my budget, his budget," [...] and saying, [...] "it was a fight, internally." [...] Edward Lazear of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers said that Portman was the leading advocate for a balanced budget, while other former Bush <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> that Portman was the leading advocate for fiscal discipline, within the administration.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. President Barack Obama {{touched on}} the subject of combat drones in a speech on Counterterrorism {{delivered}} on 23 May 2013 at the National Defense University. [...] "It is a hard fact that US strikes have resulted in civilian casualties," [...] he said, adding, [...] "These deaths will haunt us. But as commander-in-chief I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternative. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties." [...] Obama said new guidance allowed targeting only those terrorists posing [...] "a continuing and imminent threat to the American people", which <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> meant only individuals planning attacks on the U.S. homeland or against U.S. persons abroad. Obama defended the use of drones as just because America [...] "is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban and their associated forces". To stop terrorists from gaining a foothold, drones will be deployed according to Obama, but only when there is an imminent threat; no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist; [...] "near certainty" [...] that civilians won't be harmed; and [...] "there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat". Never will a strike be punitive.|$|E
2500|$|NFFE became {{embroiled in}} a major legal fight with the Reagan {{administration}}. In August 1987, the Reagan administration issued civil service rules requiring all federal workers to sign a new secrecy pledge, Standard Form 189. [...] <b>Administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> the new form was designed merely to reinforce {{the need to maintain}} the security of those documents classified as top secret. [...] But NFFE filed a lawsuit on August 17, 1987, challenging the constitutionality of the secrecy pledge. In May 1988, a U.S. District Court ruled in National Federation of Federal Employees v. United States (688 F. Supp. 671) that Standard Form 189 was constitutional. The NFFE and other plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In July 1988, the District Court further held in National Federation of Federal Employees v. United States (695 F. Supp. 1196) that certain terms in Standard Form 189 needed additional clarification by the executive branch. NFFE appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Meanwhile, in September 1988, the federal government issued Standard Form 312 as a replacement for Standard Form 189. The new form expunged much of the objectionable language which had so deeply concerned NFFE and other unions. On April 18, 1989, the Supreme Court held in American Foreign Service Association v. Garfinkel, 490 U.S. 153, that the issuance of Standard Form 312 may have resolved the conflict. The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the District Court to resolve any outstanding issues. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also remanded the second NFFE lawsuit to District Court. In March 1990, the District Court dismissed the remaining issues in its ruling in American Foreign Service Association v. Garfinkel, 732 F. Supp. 13), and NFFE dropped any further attempts to revive the suit.|$|E

A senior <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> <b>said</b> that {{the main purpose of}} Rice’s trip would be to step up pressure on Kenya’s president, warning him that he risked losing American support if he did not compromise.

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of bin Laden, former U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism Juan Zarate said that al-Zawahiri would [...] "clearly assume the mantle of leadership" [...] of al-Qaeda. But a senior U.S. <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> <b>said</b> that {{although}} al-Zawahiri {{was likely to be}} al-Qaeda's next leader, his authority was not [...] "universally accepted" [...] among al-Qaeda's followers, particularly in the Gulf region. Zarate said that al-Zawahiri was more controversial and less charismatic than bin Laden. Rashad Mohammad Ismail (AKA [...] "Abu Al-Fida"), a leading member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, stated that al-Zawahiri was the best candidate.|$|R
