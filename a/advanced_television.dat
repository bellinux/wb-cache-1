2500|$|The final {{standard}} {{adopted by}} the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over {{which of the two}} scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not [...] "flicker" [...] in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, that is, 1080 lines per picture and 1920 pixels per line. William F. Schreiber, who was a director of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Television</b> Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.|$|E

2500|$|Some macronyms can be {{multiply}} nested: the second-order acronym {{points to}} another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine New Scientist, a fully documented specimen was discovered {{that may be the}} most deeply nested of all: RARS is the [...] "Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service"; ATOVS is [...] "Advanced TOVS"; TOVS is [...] "TIROS operational vertical sounder"; and TIROS is [...] "Television infrared observational satellite". Fully expanded, [...] "RARS" [...] might thus become [...] "Regional <b>Advanced</b> <b>Television</b> Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service". However, to say that [...] "RARS" [...] stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in syntax (in the same way that [...] "CHF" [...] can be usefully interchanged with [...] "congestive heart failure"), is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to [...] "spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations," [...] but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words laser and radar function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as [...] "RARS" [...] and [...] "CHA2DS2–VASc score" [...] are irreducible in natural language; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, protein and gene nomenclature, which uses symbols extensively, includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain, which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from Podospora anserine), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners.|$|E
