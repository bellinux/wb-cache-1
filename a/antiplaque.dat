40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures {{in the absence}} and presence of an additional <b>antiplaque</b> agent commonly used after oral surgery. Materials and Methods: Triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an <b>antiplaque</b> rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. Sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. Results: Triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. Exposure to the <b>antiplaque</b> rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. However, after application of the <b>antiplaque</b> rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. Conclusion: Sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing <b>antiplaque</b> rinse appears to be counterproductive.

40|$|This {{article will}} focus on the <b>antiplaque</b> {{efficacy}} of mouthwashes. An <b>antiplaque</b> agent inhibits the formation of plaque and also reduces gingivitis. There is good evidence that chlorhexidine digluconate, used in the correct concentrations, is the gold standard agent against which all others should be measured. It does, however, have some unwanted side-effects. One of the major problems for <b>antiplaque</b> mouthwashes is that they have a much reduced effect on established plaque within the oral environment. Although they can flow into the biofilm channels and kill bacteria in the superficial layers of dental plaque, they cannot penetrate the biomass and inhibit the pathogenic bacteria adjacent to the tooth surface and gingival margin. There is no evidence that they prevent the progression of periodontitis. CPD/Clinical Relevance: The evidence supporting the use of ‘over the counter’ <b>antiplaque</b> mouthwashes is evaluated. This provides guidance for dentists and dental care professionals of when it is appropriate to recommend mouthwash use to their patients...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Various {{antibacterial}} and <b>antiplaque</b> {{agents are}} used in chemical plaque control but none are without their shortcomings. Chlorhexidine considered a gold standard, also has an array of side effects. To overcome these, numerous herbal extracts have been tried and tested and one among them is holy basil. The present study evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of holy basil in vitro against some periodontopathogens and its <b>antiplaque</b> ef fect in vivo. Study Design: Thirty periodontally healthy volunteers were randomly divided into three groups and refrained from all mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 days and used one of the randomly assigned mouthwash (1 - chlor - hexidine; 2 - holy basil; and 3 - sterile water [placebo]) twice daily. The Plaque Index (PI) was assessed at days 0 and 5. Aqueous extract of holy basil was tested against Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). Results: Holy basil extract showed inhibition of both the tested periodontopathogens (P. intermedia and F. nucleatum) at various concentrations. In all groups, the PI increased from baseline to day 5. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} (p <. 05) between the chlorhexidine and placebo rinse and the holy basil and placebo rinse, but no statis - tically significant difference was found between the chlorhexidine and holy basil rinse with respect to PI. Conclusions: These results indicate that the holy basil mouthwash has an <b>antiplaque</b> effect and is efficacious against P. intermedia and F. nucleatum strains in vitro.

40|$|Background: The {{relatively}} safe nature and cost-effectiveness of herbal extracts {{have led to}} a resurgent interest in their utility as therapeutic agents. Therefore, this prospective, double-blind, randomly controlled clinical trial was designed to compare the <b>antiplaque</b> and antigingivitis effects of newly formulated mouthrinse containing tea tree oil (TTO), clove, and basil with those of commercially available essential oil (EO) mouthrinse. Materials and Methods: Forty patients were selected for a 21 -day study period and randomly divided into two groups. The test group patients were given newly formulated herbal mouthrinse and the control group patients were given commercially available EO mouthrinse. The Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), and Papillary Marginal Attachment (PMA) Index were recorded at baseline, 14 days, and 21 days. The microbial colony forming units (CFU) were assessed at baseline and 21 days. Results: Test group patients using herbal mouthrinse showed significant improvement in GI (0. 16), PI (0. 57), and PMA (0. 02) scores. These improvements were comparable to those achieved with commercially available EO mouthrinse. However, the aerobic and anaerobic CFU of microbiota were reduced with the herbal mouthrinse (P = 0. 0000). Conclusion: The newly formulated herbal mouthrinse and commercially available mouthrinse were beneficial clinically as <b>antiplaque</b> and antigingivitis agents.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical effects of a dental gel containing barberry extracts (from Berberis vulgaris) on gingivitis and microbial plaque control. A double blind clinical trial study was conducted in a dormitory on 45 boys aged 11 - 12 years having the same socioeconomic conditions. These students were divided into 3 groups; the first group (25 students) using barberry gel, and the second group (10 students) using placebo gel without active ingredient. To compare the activity of our gel with an active <b>antiplaque,</b> a third group of 10 students using Colgate® <b>antiplaque</b> toothpaste was also considered. At the beginning all subjects were examined for plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI). These tests were re-evaluated after 21 days of using the above mentioned dentifrices. The results showed that barberry gel has reduced the PI for about 56 %. This reduction was 18. 5 % for placebo and 44 % for Colgate ® <b>antiplaque</b> groups. Considering means of PI (ΔPI) and GI (ΔGI) of different groups, there was significant difference between barberry and placebo gel’s groups and between placebo and Colgate ® groups, but the difference between barberry and Colgate ® groups was not significant.

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity of three iodine-containing compounds was deter-mined for strains of four dental plaque-forming microorganisms, using an in vitro preclinical plaque model system. Solutions of inorganic iodine, povidone-iodine, and Wescodyne were tested for <b>antiplaque</b> activity against preformed plaques {{of a number}} of strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Solutions of inorganic io-dine were more effective as <b>antiplaque</b> agents, with respect to minimal bacteri-cidal concentration and time and frequency of treatments, than solutions of Wescodyne and povidone-iodine. Inorganic iodine appeared to be particularly effective against the most cariogenic (S. mutans) and periodontopathic (A. viscosus) organisms while allowing survival of the least orally pathogenic plaque-forming microorganism (S. sanguis). It is suggested that topical applica-tion of solutions of inorganic iodine may be useful in controlling dental caries and actinomyces-associated periodontal disease.

With the description of the <b>antiplaque</b> agent chlorhexidine," 12 the possibility of a chemother-apeutic approach to plaque prevention has been renewed. The retention of chlorhexidine in the mouth by adsorption to and desorption from teeth, pellicle, or other oral surfaces, as well as its bacterial properties per se, is im-portant to the drug's plaque-inhibiting ef-fects. 3 - 5 Any <b>antiplaque</b> agent, regardless of its mode of action or delivery which is similarly retained in the oral cavity, should have a more significant long-term effect than one that does not adsorb and is therefore immediately lost from the oral cavity.

40|$|Several {{chemical}} agents {{have been used}} to aid in the removal of dental plaque and to prevent or decrease the occurrence of oral diseases, Defining the interactions of {{chemical agents}} and saliva contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved in chemical plaque control. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the salivary interactions between two <b>antiplaque</b> agents and saliva and microorganisms at defined solid/liquid and air liquid interfaces. The plaque control agents used in this study were delmopinol and chlorhexidine in varying concentrations. Sample of polled whole saliva collected from 16 subjects were used for adsorption experiments to solid surfaces. Whole saliva from one individual was used to study the adsorption of chemical agents to bacterial cell walls. Whole saliva samples from five subjects were used to study the binding or precipitation of salivary components by the <b>antiplaque</b> agents in solution. The interactions between the chemical <b>antiplaque</b> agents and the salivary components were investigated with ellipsometry, tensitometry, electrophoresis, video-densitometry, electrobloting, and radiolabeling. The results indicate that chlorhexidine is a surface active compound that has the capability to adsorb onto bare solid surfaces of well-defined chemical characteristics and onto surfaces preconditioned with salivary films. Chlorhexidine and delmopinol were shown to have binding sites for salivary proteins and to induce precipitation of salivary proteins. Delmopinol appears to precipitate more high molecular weight salivary proteins than chlorhexidine. It was also demonstrated that the composition of saliva as well as the concentration of chlorhexidine or delmopinol play a role in the amount of salivary proteins precipitated. In addition, chlorhexidine and delmopinol were round to bind to the salivary films coating the tested bacteria. The substantivities of both agents are related to their binding capabilities to salivary proteins.

In Group A, 50 subjects were advised the experimental mouthwash. Group B subjects used placebo mouthrinse, and chlorhexidine mouth wash was given to Group C. The subjects were advised to use 10 ml of mouthwash for 1 min twice a day 30 min after brushing. Parameters were recorded for plaque, gingival, and sulcus bleeding indices at day 0, 7, 14, and 28 days along with subjective assessment of taste. Results: On intragroup comparison between curcumin, chlorhexidine, and placebo mouthwash, the mean percentage reduction of the plaque index (PI) between 0 and 28 days were 0. 58, 0. 57 and 1. 17, respectively (P < 0. 01), percentage reduction of gingival index (GI) between 0 and 28 days were 0. 65, 0. 66, and 1. 09, respectively (P < 0. 01) and sulcus bleeding index (SBI) showed a percentage reduction of 0. 69, 0. 66, and 1. 13, respectively The intergroup comparison revealed chlorhexidine and curcumin mouthwash were statistically significant with P < 0. 001 as compared to placebo. Conclusion: Curcumin mouthwash has shown an <b>antiplaque</b> and antigingivitis properties comparable to chlorhexidine mouthwash. Thus, curcumin mouthwash and chlorhexidine gluconate can be effectively used as an adjunct to scaling and root planning...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{formulate}} chewing gum using chlorhexidine and chitosan and to prove its antibacterial and <b>antiplaque</b> properties effectively at low doses of chlorhexidine. Materials and Methods: Chewing gums were prepared by using chlorhexidine and various proportions of gum base and chitosan. Hot melt technique was used to prepare chewing gums. The prepared gums were evaluated for physical parameters, compatibility studies, drug content, moisture content, stability studies and in vitro drug-release testing. To carry out in vivo study on humans double-blind, crossover clinical trial was conducted on 18 adult volunteers from Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, JSS Dental College, Mysore. The test group administered chewing gums containing chlorhexidine, with and without the polymer, while the control group administered dummy chewing gums. The volunteers were visually examined for presence or absence of gingival erythema, gingival edema and gingival bleeding and the antibacterial activity was assessed by the reduction in bacterial count in the plaque samples. Result: As the proportion of gum base was increased, an increase in hardness of the chewing gum was observed. The formulation, which contains highest concentration of chitosan, showed more in vitro release compared to other formulation. Analysis of variance revealed signifi cant differences between subjects receiving F 1 and F 5 for <b>antiplaque</b> activity. The post plaque samples results showed signifi cant reduction in microbial count (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The in vivo studies on human volunteers were carried out for optimized formulation F 5 containing chitosan and antibacteria...|$|E
40|$|Sugar-free {{chewing gum}} has been {{claimed to be}} a useful means of {{reducing}} dental plaque accumulation. The incorporation of additives, such as enzymes, abrasives and divalent metal ions, into gum formulations might improve their <b>antiplaque</b> activity, particularly at the buccal and lingual surfaces of the teeth. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the plaque inhibitory effects of three sugar-free chewing gums each containing lactoperoxidase (LP), micro granules of silicon dioxide (SD), and zinc gluconate (ZG). Methods: The study was an observer-masked, randomized cross-over design balanced for carryover effects, involving 12 healthy volunteers in a 4 -day plaque regrowth model. An additive-free (AF) gum served as positive/negative control for occlusal and smooth surfaces, respectively. On day 1, subjects received professional prophylaxis, suspended oral hygiene measures, and commenced chewing their allocated product. Gum chewing was one piece chewed for 30 min 4 times a day. On day 5, subjects were scored for disclosed plaque. Results: There were no significant differences in <b>antiplaque</b> activity of the gums tested, neither for the smooth nor for the occlusal surfaces (P = 0. 447 and P = 0. 418, respectively). Similar results were obtained for the anterior and posterior sites of smooth surfaces (P > 0. 05), and for the lower and upper sites of occlusal surfaces (P = 0. 451 and P = 0. 53, respectively). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the chewing gums containing LP, SD and ZG would provide no plaque inhibitory effects on smooth surfaces. The gums containing these additives, therefore, should not be recommended as adjuncts to mechanical oral hygien...|$|E
