5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves of Grass, critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. Leaves of Grass was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E
5|$|Only 40 seconds {{into the}} second half, Quinn almost {{restored}} St Johnstone's 3-goal advantage but his attempt on goal rebounded off the goalpost despite beating the goalkeeper. In the 59th minute, Dunfermline defender Danny Murphy was {{the first player to}} be cautioned by the referee, receiving a yellow card for bringing Quinn to the ground whilst tackling for the ball. In the 64th minute, Dunfermline made their second substitution; Michael McGlinchey was replaced by Jim Hamilton and he had an almost immediate impact on the match, earning a penalty kick after being pushed by Anderson. Referee Smith initially awarded a free kick {{on the edge of the}} penalty area but changed his mind amid complaints from Dunfermline players and awarded a penalty kick instead. Stephen Glass took the penalty kick, hitting the ball past goalkeeper Main into the top corner of the goal to make the score 3–2. Dunfermline continued to pressure for an equalising goal and <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> so when St Johnstone defender Goran Stanić nearly scored an own goal after mis-hitting the ball but it rebounded off the crossbar. Despite Dunfermline's late improvement in form, St Johnstone held on to win the match and claim the first national cup trophy in their 123-year existence.|$|E

25|$|World War I had a {{profound}} impact on woman suffrage across the belligerents. Women played a major role on the homefronts and many countries recognized their sacrifices with the vote during or shortly after the war, including the United States, Britain, Canada (except Quebec), Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Ireland. France <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> so but stopped short.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{expansive}} was {{an increase}} in Ukrainian language publishing and the overall flourishing of Ukrainian cultural life. As of 1931 out of 88 theatres in Ukraine, 66 were Ukrainian, 12 were Jewish (Yiddish) and 9 were Russian. The number of Ukrainian newspapers, which <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not exist in 1922, had reached 373 out of 426, while only 3 all-republican large newspapers remained Russian. Of 118 magazines, 89 were Ukrainian. Ukrainization of book-publishing reached 83%.|$|E

Alcano ran out on the next rack to tie the score for the final time. Kuribayashi broke for the game but the two got locked in a safety battle. Alcano managed to hit on the 3-ball, that <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not fall on the pocket; ALcano then ran out to face Orcullo in the semifinals {{ensuring}} that a Filipino {{will play in the}} final.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{management}} ran into unexpected financial problems, and the brief success soon withered. Only {{a few years}} later, they had to avert bankruptcy twice, which struck a blow to their credibility, as a mass desertion of the players ensued. The first line was a shambles as wing Risto Kerminen departed and center Jari Lindroos <b>almost</b> <b>did,</b> but though he had signed elsewhere, the contract was illegitimately nullified. Few others, apart from the longtime goaltender Rauli Sohlman, remained. Jokerit faced the imminent relegation in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Roof waived his {{extradition}} {{rights and}} was flown to Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston {{on the evening}} of June 18. At the jail, his cell-block neighbor was Michael Slager, the former North Charleston police officer charged with murder after he shot Walter Scott. According to unconfirmed reports, Roof confessed to committing the attack and said his purpose was to start a race war. He reportedly told investigators he <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not go through with his mission because members of the church study group had been so nice to him.|$|E
25|$|The Kanins wrote My Pal Gus (1952) {{in which}} Richard Widmark becomes {{a good father}} and {{falls in love with}} Joanne Dru, the Elizabeth Taylor film Rhapsody (1954) and The Opposite Sex (1956), a musical remake of The Women. But it was the Oscar-nominated script for Teacher's Pet (1958) for which they are best remembered, a film about a self-made {{newspaper}} editor Clark Gable who has a love-hate relationship with journalism teacher Doris Day. The film <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not get made since the Kanins were not under any studio contract, and having shopped the script around without attracting any interest, it was only after a rewrite inspired by Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday that producer Bill Perlberg and director George Seaton purchased it.|$|E

25|$|Republic's {{anxiety was}} erased by the resounding success of The Quiet Man (Republic, 1952), a pet project which Ford {{had wanted to}} make since the 1930s (and <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> so in 1937 with an {{independent}} cooperative called Renowned Artists Company). It became his biggest grossing picture to date, taking nearly $4million in the US alone {{in its first year}} and ranking in the top 10 box office films of its year. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won Ford his fourth Oscar for Best Director, as well a second Best Cinematography Oscar for Winton Hoch. It was followed by What Price Glory? (1952), a World War I drama, the first of two films Ford made with James Cagney (Mister Roberts was the other) which also did good business at the box office ($2million).|$|E
25|$|Laying of the memorial's {{cornerstone}} {{occurred on}} November 1, 1923. Planners had initially proposed that cornerstone be laid on November 4, 1923—the 170th anniversary of George Washington's initiation into Freemasonry. But because November 4 fell on a Sunday in 1923, {{the ceremony was}} scheduled for November 1. The ceremony <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not occur. A short time before the event, contractors discovered that the cornerstone for the memorial had been cut too small. A new cornerstone was quickly fashioned and completed just in time. Alexandria Mayor William Allen Smoot declared a holiday, and all businesses closed except for banks and the U.S. post office. The United States Navy light cruiser USS Richmond and a U.S. Navy destroyer anchored at the Alexandria torpedo factory {{as part of the}} festivities. Trains ran every three minutes into the city of Alexandria in order to accommodate the crowds.|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt Jr. {{opened the}} Challenger Round with a 12th-place finish at Chicagoland. At New Hampshire, he ran up front {{for most of}} the day, but an {{emergency}} fuel stop with two laps to go led him to finish 25th, two laps down, and {{at the bottom of the}} Chase cutline. At Dover, despite falling back at a few points, Earnhardt Jr. was locked in a battle with Jamie McMurray for control of the final transfer spot into the Contender Round. He <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not make it into the next round, with his chances being saved thanks to a caution for Brett Moffitt's crash on lap 357 keeping him from having to make a green flag pit stop to replace a loose wheel. On the last restart, Earnhardt Jr. overtook McMurray on the outside, and finished third, clinching the final transfer spot and bumping McMurray out of the Chase.|$|E

25|$|In November 1941, the Wehrmacht {{was already}} near Moscow. But {{from the rear}} of the Soviet Union, {{military}} equipment and armaments continued to arrive. The main supplier was GAZ, which was in Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod). Therefore, the German command developed a plan to destroy the industrial potential and occupation of the city. Thus, Germany was counting on gaining control over the entire Volga region. On November 4, the Luftwaffe began bombing of Gorky. After the first raid, some workshops of GAZ and the Dvigatel Revolyutsii plant were damaged. The main building was destroyed at the Nitel plant, which caused the death of the director and management. The second attack on the city brought much more destruction. GAZ was almost completely disabled. On its territory, many shops and adjoining social facilities were destroyed. However, in the first year of bombing, German aviation <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not bombing administrative buildings. There were also no raids on the Kremlin. In the following years, the attacks on Gorky continued again.|$|E
25|$|The first tournaments of the Australasian Championships {{suffered}} from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states and New Zealand had their own championships, the first organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of Victoria (later the Championship of Victoria). In those years, the best two players– Australian Norman Brookes (whose name is now written on the men's singles cup) and New Zealander Anthony Wilding– <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not play this tournament. Brookes came once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped {{to determine the best}} Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round once and then won Wimbledon twice. Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, William Larned, Maurice McLoughlin, Beals Wright, Bill Johnston, Bill Tilden, René Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Ted Schroeder, Pancho Gonzales, Budge Patty, and others, while Brookes, Ellsworth Vines, Jaroslav Drobný, came just once. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when travel was less difficult, leading players such as Manuel Santana, Jan Kodeš, Manuel Orantes, Ilie Năstase (who only came once, when 35 years old) and Björn Borg came rarely or not at all.|$|E

500|$|The scenes where Dwight {{climbs into}} a box <b>almost</b> <b>did</b> not make the episode.

After shooting the scene, however, he described it as [...] "the most natural thing in the world." [...] Phil Shaw, the stunt man for The Office, did most of the work in the box. Schur described Dwight's emergence from the box as his [...] "action hero" [...] moment. Daniels likened the scene to the movie Alien.|$|E
