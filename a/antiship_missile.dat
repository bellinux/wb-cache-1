50|$|<b>Antiship</b> <b>missiles</b> are a {{significant}} threat to surface ships, which have large radar, radio, and thermal signatures {{that are difficult to}} suppress. Once acquired, a ship cannot outrun or out-turn a missile, the warhead of which can inflict significant damage. To counter the threat posed, the modern surface combatant has to either avoid being detected, destroy the missile launch platform before it fires its missiles, or decoy or destroy all of the incoming missiles. Modern navies have spent much time and effort developing counters to the threat of <b>antiship</b> <b>missiles</b> since World War II. <b>Antiship</b> <b>missiles</b> have been the driving force behind many aspects of modern ship design, especially in navies that operate aircraft carriers.|$|R
