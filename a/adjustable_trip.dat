2500|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are manufactured}} in standard sizes, using {{a system of}} preferred numbers to cover a range of ratings. Miniature circuit breakers have a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires changing the whole circuit breaker. Larger circuit breakers can have <b>adjustable</b> <b>trip</b> settings, allowing standardized elements to be applied but with a setting intended to improve protection. For example, a circuit breaker with a 400 ampere [...] "frame size" [...] might have its overcurrent detection set to operate at only 300 amperes, to protect a feeder cable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cold cathode}} system was {{installed}} {{in a number of}} gold mines and worked reliably. However, Rubin began working on a completely novel system with greatly improved sensitivity, and by early 1956, he had produced a prototype second-harmonic magnetic amplifier-type core balance system (South African Patent No. 2268/56 and Australian Patent No. 218360). [...] The prototype magamp was rated at 220 V, 60 A and had an internally <b>adjustable</b> <b>tripping</b> sensitivity of 12.5â€“17.5 mA. Very rapid tripping times were achieved through a novel design, and this combined with the high sensitivity was well within the safe current-time envelope for ventricular fibrillation determined by Charles Dalziel of the University of California, Berkeley, USA, who had estimated electrical shock hazards in humans. [...] This system, with its associated circuit breaker, included overcurrent and short-circuit protection. In addition, the original prototype was able to trip at a lower sensitivity in the presence of an interrupted neutral, thus protecting against an important cause of electrical fire.|$|R
25|$|Air circuit breakersRated current up to 6,300 A {{and higher}} for {{generator}} circuit breakers. Trip characteristics are often fully <b>adjustable</b> including configurable <b>trip</b> thresholds and delays. Usually electronically controlled, though some models are microprocessor controlled via an integral electronic trip unit. Often used for main power distribution in large industrial plant, where the breakers {{are arranged in}} draw-out enclosures for ease of maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|Both [...] "S" [...] bikes, the ST4s and ST3s, {{could be}} {{equipped}} with ABS from 2003. In 2004, an upgrade to the ST line brought a modified nose fairing and dashboard, <b>adjustable</b> ergonomics, a <b>trip</b> computer, four-way (hazard) flashers, digital speedometer, a dashboard-controlled adjustable headlight, a new seat design, Euro-2 catalytic exhaust, and a simplified CAN-bus wiring setup. Dry weight was reduced by 11 kg due to the lighter wiring harness and simpler support structure for {{the nose of the}} bike.|$|R
