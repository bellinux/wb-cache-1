2500|$|During {{the last}} few seconds, the {{aircraft}} climbed to 3,090 feet. The Captain put in 52 degrees of bank to turn the aircraft, and also made some nose down inputs. Therefore, the aircraft pitched down, speed increased and auto thrust commanded the engines to spool down to keep airspeed on the target speed. The aircraft started to descend at a high rate. Unfortunately in his panic, the Captain continued to move the heading knob without actually looking at it, but failed to pull the knob to activate it. When he did activate it, the aircraft turned towards the heading knob that had been rotated too far, to 25 degrees, and stayed on that course until end of recording. At 04:40:49 the Captain said to the First Officer [...] "Why the aircraft is not turning left?" [...] The aircraft then slammed into Margala Hills and exploded. The First Officer's last words could be heard saying to the Captain [...] "Sir we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>down!</b> Sir we are going do—".|$|E
