5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>like</b> in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E

[...] "There was a huge screaming noise and I got out of the car as the plane came over. Everybody was running away in different directions. It was tilting its wings up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> it was trying to balance. It hit some lampposts on the way in." [...] Daryl Donley witnessed the crash and took some of the first photographs of the site.|$|E

500|$|Running {{the entire}} length of the south range the Long Gallery is roofed with heavy gritstone slabs, the weight of which has caused the {{supporting}} floors below to bow and buckle. Architectural historians Peter de Figueiredo and Julian Treuherz describe it as [...] "a gloriously long and crooked space, the wide floorboards rising up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> waves and the walls leaning outwards at different angles." [...] The crossbeams between the arch-braced roof trusses were probably added in the 17th century to prevent the structure from [...] "bursting apart" [...] under the load.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers held differing {{opinions}} on the game's setting and themes. Sumner stated the game is [...] "dragged down by distasteful graphics and a horribly grim inlay." [...] Roberts described the game as [...] "sick", adding [...] "I only recommend Soft & Cuddly to {{those of you who}} cut your toenails with a carving knife!" [...] Douglas was critical of the game's themes; he described playing Soft & Cuddly as [...] "watching very large and unpleasant graphics jigging up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> a box of offal". Tony Lee of Your Sinclair was more positive, stating, [...] "This is a very sick game indeed, but fortunately I have a very sick sense of humour." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Greg Tobin and Robert J. Wister, Agagianian, {{known to}} have been close to Pope Pius XII, was one of the {{favorites}} in the 1958 conclave. His candidacy was widely discussed in the press. Even before the death of Pope Pius XII, The Milwaukee Sentinel wrote that some authoritative voices of Vatican affairs believe that Agagianian was [...] "without question the leading candidate" [...] to succeed Pope Pius XII. On October 9, the day Pope Pius died, The Sentinel wrote that he is [...] "considered by very responsible Vatican circles as the foremost choice" [...] to succeed Pope Pius. The Chicago Tribune wrote on October 25 that although Agagianian was popular amongst believers, the cardinals were expected to try first to agree on an Italian cardinal. The election was seen as a struggle between Italian Angelo Roncalli (who was eventually elected and became Pope John XXIII) and non-Italian Agagianian. Agagianian came in second according to Massimo Faggioli and contemporary press reports. Three months after the conclave, Roncalli revealed that his name and that of Agagianian [...] "went up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> two chickpeas in boiling water" [...] during the conclave. Armenian-American journalist Tom Vartabedian suggests that it is possible that Agagianian might have been elected but declined the post.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} was well received by game critics {{and has been}} noted for her sex appeal. Both David Rakoff of The New York Times and Darek Pasturczak of Wirtualna Polska called her [...] "beautiful but deadly." [...] Dreamcast Magazine ranked her as the seventh top [...] "girl on the Dreamcast" [...] in 2000, commenting: [...] "With an oriental flavour to her moves and style, Xianghua {{is a bit of}} a minx even though she looks sweet and innocent." [...] GameSpy's Dave Kosak wrote a better translation of Xianghua's victory one-liner could be [...] "Don't you want to just lick me up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> a popsicle?" [...] and GamesRadar's Shane Petterson described her official artwork for Soulcalibur IV as [...] "screwing you with her eyes." [...] Arcade Sushi's John Llewellyn Martin called Xianghua one of the series' [...] "most beloved characters" [...] and Kotaku's Alex Jaffe listed her among [...] "the world's best fighting characters".|$|E
2500|$|The foot pedals {{slide back}} and forth and also move up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> {{accelerator}} pedals. Pointman uses these inputs to control the avatar's lower body. The translational sliding (apart then together) is mapped to control the separation of the avatar's legs, simulating stepping when the avatar is upright and crawling when the avatar is prone. This allows users to take precise, measured steps when moving around obstacles or cover, and to continuously vary their speed over a realistic range of walking, running and crawling gaits. [...] The up-down movement of the pedals is mapped to control the avatar's postural height via the flexing of the avatar's legs. [...] This allows the avatar to continuously transition from standing tall to a low crouch (or kneel when the legs are apart), and when prone from hands-and-knees to belly-on-the-ground. The ability to precisely control their avatar's postural height allows users to make better use of cover and concealment, and to look and shoot out from behind cover while minimizing their exposure.|$|E
2500|$|There was no ballot on {{the first}} day. Four ballots {{on the second day}} proved inconclusive. Both times the smoke that {{reported}} the results of the morning and afternoon ballots appeared white at first, leading to excited false reports that the election was over. The official responsible for arrangements outside the conclave notified the cardinals that the color of the smoke had been misread and provided them with [...] "smoke torches from a fireworks factory". The third day's four ballots again failed to select a pope and there was no confusion about the color of the smoke. Requests from a doctor inside the conclave for medical records suggested several cardinals were ill. It took a few ballots for supporters of Lercaro, [...] "who was known to favor a simplified liturgy in local languages", and of [...] "the aggressively sententious" [...] Siri to recognized they could not garner the necessary 35 votes. The deadlock that then developed between Roncalli and Agagianian led Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, Dean of the College of Cardinals, to suggest Masella as a compromise candidate without success. Roncalli later said that his name and Agagianian's [...] "went up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>like</b> two chickpeas in boiling water". Black smoke reported the ninth and tenth ballots were inconclusive on 28 October at 11:10am.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2000, Suzuki {{released}} [...] "Don't Need to Say Good Bye" [...] which debuted {{at number}} 5. A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one.　Suzuki has said {{of this first}} period of her career {{that she was not}} free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling [...] "pretty disheartened <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>like</b> there was no future.". Suzuki had been writing lyrics from an early age and passing them to her manager and producers. The first song to feature them, with the help of Mitsuko and Tetsuya Komuro, was her tenth Sony single, [...] "Don't Need to Say Good Bye". The lyrics were influenced by events occurring in her personal life at that time, specifically her upcoming high school graduation and she has said [...] "it was more important to me than sales and chart rankings to know that I had put my thoughts and feelings into what I was singing."　Three months after Infinity Eighteen Vol.1, Suzuki released her twelfth single, [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] in the beginning of April and third studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 at the end of April. [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] sold a total of 234,000 copies reaching number one and Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 sold a total of 427,000 copies reaching number two. [...] "Reality/Dancin' in Hip-Hop" [...] was Suzuki's 12th single released under the Sony Music Japan label, on 27 September 2000. It reached number 3 on Oricon weekly chart and sold a total of 211,000 copies. A compilation album of Suzuki's tracks, Fun for Fan, was released on 30 May 2001. It reached number 1 on the Oricon charts, despite the fact that by this point, Suzuki herself had vanished from the public eye and Sony had taken all of her previous singles and albums off CD shelves.|$|E
