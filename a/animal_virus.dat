40|$|Aerosol samples {{collected}} at the Muskegon County Wastewater Management System Number 1 spray irrigation site in Michigan by using the Army prototype XM 2 Biological Sampler/Collector were examined {{for the presence of}} <b>animal</b> <b>viruses,</b> coliphages, and bacteria. Air samples, collected in Earle lactalbumen hydrolysate, and wastewater samples were filtered through a 0. 45 - and 1. 2 -micron membrane filter sandwich, pretreated with 10 % beef extract (pH 7. 0), and assayed for <b>animal</b> <b>viruses</b> by the plaque method on Buffalo green monkey kidney cells. Untreated air and wastewater samples were assayed for coliphages by the soft agar overlay method with three Escherichia coli hosts (ATCC 13706, 15597, and 11303) and for bacteria by the heterotrophic plate count method. Filtered air samples were assayed for coliphages by the most-probable-number method with the same three hosts. Although no <b>animal</b> <b>viruses</b> were detected in the aerosol samples, coliphages and bacteria were recovered. E. coli ATCC 13706 coliphage were recovered more often and in greater numbers than either of the other two types of coliphages. Concentrations of <b>animal</b> <b>viruses,</b> coliphages, and bacteria detected in the raw influent decreased as the wastewater was aerated and stored in the lagoons. No <b>animal</b> <b>viruses</b> were detected in the wastewater at the pump station just before distribution to the spray irrigation rigs. The most-probable-number method was more sensitive and consistent than the overlay procedure in detecting low levels of coliphages in air samples...|$|R

40|$|Insect {{transmission}} {{is an essential}} process of infection for numerous plant and <b>animal</b> <b>viruses.</b> How an insect-transmissible plant virus enters an insect cell to initiate the infection cycle is poorly understood, especially for nonenveloped plant and <b>animal</b> <b>viruses.</b> The capsid protein P 2 of rice dwarf virus (RDV), which is nonenveloped, is necessary for insect transmission. Here, we present evidence that P 2 shares structural features with membrane-fusogenic proteins encoded by enveloped <b>animal</b> <b>viruses.</b> When RDV P 2 was ectopically expressed and displayed {{on the surface of}} insect Spodoptera frugiperda cells, it induced membrane fusion characterized by syncytium formation at low pH. Mutational analyses identified the N-terminal and a heptad repeat as being critical for the membrane fusion-inducing activity. These results are corroborated with results from RDV-infected cells of the insect vector leafhopper. We propose that the RDV P 2 -induced membrane fusion plays a critical role in viral entry into insect cells. Our report that a plant viral protein can induce membrane fusion has broad significance in studying the mechanisms of virus entry into insect cells and insect transmission of nonenveloped plant and <b>animal</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology, a cap-independent translation element (CITE or 3'CITE) is an RNA sequence {{found in}} the 3'UTR of many RNA plant viruses. [...] Eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 5' cap structure which is required for efficient binding of translation initiation factors. Many viral mRNAs lack the 5' cap, <b>animal</b> <b>virus</b> mRNAs often contain an internal ribosome entry site which functions in translation initiation. Many plant viral mRNAs contain a cap-independent translation element. These elements mediate initiation of translation of the proteins encoded in the mRNA by either recruiting translation inititation factors or the 60S ribosomal subunit to the viral RNA. In RNA2 of Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) the cap-independent translation element is required for negative strand RNA synthesis.|$|E

50|$|Parker {{was born}} in London in 1950. He was a pupil at Chobham Secondary Modern School in Surrey. After {{the arrival of the}} Beatles, Parker and some other 12/13 year olds formed the Deepcut Three, soon renamed the Black Rockers. None of the members {{actually}} learned to play their instruments, however, and were merely dress-up bands, adopting Beatle haircuts, black jeans and polo neck sweaters. By the time Parker was 15 he was a fan of soul music, especially Otis Redding, and would go to dance clubs in the nearby towns of Woking and Camberley where there was a thriving appreciation of Soul music, Motown and Ska.Parker left school at 16 and went to work at the <b>Animal</b> <b>Virus</b> Research Institute in Pirbright, Surrey, where he bred animals for foot-and-mouth disease research. At 18 he left the job and moved to Guernsey in the Channel Islands where he took a variety of jobs, picking tomatoes, digging ditches, collecting money from pinball machines, and working in a bakery. In Guernsey he bought an acoustic guitar and began to learn fingerpicking style and began writing songs with lyrics heavily influenced by the psychedelic music of the time.|$|E
50|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium - this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first <b>animal</b> <b>virus</b> - agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus) - through a similar filter.|$|E
5000|$|Both <b>animal</b> <b>viruses</b> and {{bacterial}} viruses (bacteriophage) {{are able}} to undergo mating. When a cell is mixedly infected by two genetically marked viruses, recombinant virus progeny are often observed indicating that mating interaction had occurred at the DNA level. Another manifestation of mating between viral genomes is multiplicity reactivation (MR). MR is {{the process by which}} at least two virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, interact with each other in an infected cell to form viable progeny viruses. The genes required for MR in bacteriophage T4 are largely the same as the genes required for allelic recombination. [...] Examples of MR in <b>animal</b> <b>viruses</b> are described in the articles Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, Adenoviridae, Simian virus 40, Vaccinia virus, and Reoviridae.|$|R
