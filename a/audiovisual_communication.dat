40|$|Despite the {{emergence}} of broadband Internet connections, client downstream bandwidth remains a scarce resource and should hence be managed judiciously. Based on this observation, we have previously introduced the NIProxy, a network intermediary supporting automatic client band-width management. However, the results presented in our previous work were generated using “artificial ” test appli-cations whose bandwidth management requirements could be satisfied using relatively straightforward strategies. In this paper, we evaluate the NIProxy’s suitableness to man-age client downstream bandwidth in a realistic, more com-plex networked application. The considered application supports real-time <b>audiovisual</b> user <b>communication</b> and in addition employs an advanced rendering scheme which imposes a number of specific requirements regarding the distribution of rendering-related data to clients. Through the presentation of representative experimental results, we demonstrate that the NIProxy is not only capable of ful-filling these requirements but also effectively improves the Quality of Experience (QoE) provided to users of the con-sidered application...|$|R

40|$|Motivation {{and aims}} As mobile and {{wireless}} technologies proliferate in urban environments the space {{can be considered}} as having an existence in terms of several visible and invisible layers. In particular, we consider that there is a physical layer that makes up our everyday direct experience and several invisible layers formed by the <b>audiovisual</b> and <b>communication</b> networks. Yet, due {{to the ways in which}} we have traditionally considered space, there are many limitations in current ways of perceiving and thus engaging with these immaterial environments (Willis, 2005). For this purpose, we propose concepts and methods for raising public awareness of the presence and implications of wireless networks, such as closed circuit TV (CCTV) and WiFi nodes. In these environments the physical boundaries of walls, doors and gates, and distances still frame and isolate social encounters, but wireless transmissions increasingly trespass on the situations that take place in physically defined settings. In this paper, we present a series of methods developed by the artist, Michelle Teran, for raising awareness of invisible spaces created by public wireless communicatio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn <b>audiovisual</b> speech <b>communication,</b> {{the lower}} part of the face (mainly lips and jaw) {{actively}} participates during speech production. Modeling well lip motion and deformation in audiovisual speech synthesis is important to achieve realism and effective communication. This is essential for challenged population as hard-of-hearing people or new language learners. In this scope, we propose a technique that allows for animation of a human face with realistic lips using a limited number of control points. We have used an articu-lograph that provides high temporal and spatial precision, allowing tracking the positions of small electromagnetic sensors, even when occluded, which is often the case when tracking the lip movement. In our work, the control point data are first acquired, then fitted to a 3 D face model of a human speaker, i. e., each control point is associated with a region of the face by minimizing the distance between the control points and the surface of the face model. Finally, we apply an interpolation scheme of the displacement field between the control points. This displacement field describes the deformation of a surface. In the case of the face, this method is well adapted to animating the region of the face that is highly correlated with speech, specifically the lips and {{the lower part}} of the face, even with a very limited number of control points...|$|R
