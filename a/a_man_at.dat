5|$|The western face {{is divided}} into three sections. The {{uppermost}} section is almost completely weathered. The antiquarian Alexander Gordon, who described the stone in 1726 in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene, with the figure of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the right hand side and the left side completely defaced. Below this is a depiction of a centaur holding a bow, with the lowest panel having a symmetrical floral scroll design.|$|E

5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they {{live and work in}} Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the ocean at night. It then shows a mansion by the water, in which Buena is seen {{standing}} by a balcony. The following scene shows Range entering the mansion as two men open the doors for her. Buena is shown walking {{in the middle of}} a masquerade ball, in which she captures the attention of a man. The Sugababes are shown on a couch, where Buchanan holds a man's hand; they all then walk down the mansion's staircase. Each group member begins to dance with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the ball. Buena walks towards a mirror which depicts a reflection of the Sugababes, while Buchanan drops her white mask which subsequently shatters. Towards the end of the video, they are shown leaving the ball before Buchanan jumps off the balcony and into the water. All three members are shown collectively in the water, which begins to fade out into the sky. The last scene shows the men that were in the mansion walking away.|$|E

25|$|There are countless {{indirect}} {{sources for}} the tale as well. Eternal youth is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the philosopher's stone, universal panaceas, and the elixir of life are common throughout Eurasia and elsewhere. An additional hint may have been taken from {{the account of the}} Pool of Bethesda in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus heals <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the pool in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|At 12:24 AM on July 24, {{a police}} {{dispatcher}} again issued a broadcast that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> 1384 Lakeview Road wished {{to surrender to}} black officers. Three white policemen went to the home. The man identified himself as Ahmed Evans, and peacefully surrendered. The 11:11 PM and 12:24 AM police broadcasts were the only time 1384 Lakeview had been mentioned by any police officer over the radio during the evening. Evans was unarmed when apprehended. His jammed carbine {{was found in the}} bushes {{in front of the building}} where he was found.|$|E

25|$|I {{am proud}} of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured.

And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist {{because they want to}} preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|E
25|$|During {{the nine}} years {{he lived in}} Newcastle, Nicholson {{published}} three more books, his Treatise on Projection (1837) containing his portrait, drawn from life by Edward Train, originally in pen and ink. Nicholson's final work was entitled The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch and published on 1 January 1839, the third edition of which also contained the portrait by Train. The contrast between this and the earlier portrait by Green is marked: Green painted <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> {{the peak of his}} vigour, while Train drew a much older and poorer man.|$|E
25|$|At the tribunal, Caspar's {{case was}} heard first. Caspar was {{suspended}} for four weeks. Coleman's defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation, the Players' Advocate Dan Minogue was thought {{to have made a}} good case for Coleman by arguing that any man, if he were <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> all, would hit back after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.|$|E

25|$|Endurance Course. This is an {{individual}} test comprising a challenging 6 mile (9.65 kilometres (km)) course whilst carrying 21 lb (9.5 kilogrammes (kg)) ·fighting order and personal weapon. The first two miles consist of undulating woodland terrain featuring obstacles such as tunnels, pipes, wading pools and an underwater culvert. The latter four miles (6.43 km) remain an obstacle-free metalled road return run back to CTCRM. Candidates are to complete this in 73 minutes. This {{is followed by a}} marksmanship test where the candidate must hit 6 out of 10 shots at a target simulating <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> a range of 200 metres.|$|E
25|$|Gentle {{decides to}} bring Pie to a Dearther camp at the Erasure, {{the border between}} the Second and First Dominions where Estabrook was healed earlier. Pie heads off into the Erasure after Gentle reluctantly lets him go. Gentle meets up with Father Athanasius again who {{attempts}} to kill him, but the entire camp is destroyed by the power of Hapexamendios, who pulls Pie back into the first dominion when he tries to leave. Among those killed is Estabrook, who was still living at the camp after being healed there. Gentle is determined to reconcile the dominions and enlists the help of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the Erasure, Chicka Jackeen.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Petre was {{appointed}} Consular Agent for Italy in Dunedin {{following the death}} of Edward Cargill. He was a founder member of the New Zealand Institute of Architects, was elected a Fellow in 1905, and was president of the Institute in 1907–08. Unusually for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the peak of his profession, Petre was known as congenial and popular. He died at Dunedin, in December 1918, following 42 years of architectural practice and two days after the opening of the finally completed St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru. He was buried at the Andersons Bay Cemetery, Dunedin. The building was gutted by fire in the 1940s, and is today a preserved ruin.|$|E

25|$|The ambitious Abbot Stevens died in 1399 {{and this}} may have {{made it easier to}} accept a prior from Shrewsbury. In 1401, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, {{restored}} to office by the new regime of Henry IV, was conducting a canonical visitation and personally appointed John de Acton, a monk of Shrewsbury, as successor to Tamworth. His successor, Richard Dudley, was accused of harbouring murderers and thieves in 1414. The allegations concerned the activities of a group of robbers and extortioners who killed <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> Wolverhampton and maimed others at Tettenhall. Dudley was said to have received them at the priory just before Christmas 1413. He was bailed and ultimately pardoned, as were the bandits.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, two STT Security officers, James Finnerty and Marius Beniusis, were hospitalized after {{intervening}} in the stabbing of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> the Milltown Luas stop. The officers noticed a confrontation {{on the platform}} from a tram leaving the stop and used the emergency brake to stop and disembark the tram. Neither officer noticed the presence of weapons and were sprayed with pepper spray as they approached. Beniusis received a serious stab wound to his leg as they attempted to restrain the assailants. The victim suffered serious stab wounds to the neck, back and leg and required approximately fifty stitches. Several other men fled the scene, but Finnerty and Beniusis detained two suspects until the arrival of Gardaí.|$|E
25|$|Smith had a stint with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1993 as a face,forming an {{alliance}} with top protagonist Sting, and engaging in feuds with top antagonists Sid Vicious and Big Van Vader. Smith wrestled World Heavyweight Champion Vader, {{on a number of}} occasions including the main events at Slamboree and Clash of the Champions XXIV. The feud culminated when Smith seemingly won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Vader on a tour of England in October 1993, though the decision was reversed. In July 1993, Smith was reportedly involved in an altercation with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> a bar who was making advances towards his wife. As a result of the ensuing legal issues that followed, WCW released Smith from his contract in December 1993. His final pay-per-view appearance for WCW during this period came at the November 1993 Battlebowl pay-per-view, where he was teamed with Kole in the first round of the Lethal Lottery; they lost to Road Warrior Hawk and Rip Rogers.|$|E
