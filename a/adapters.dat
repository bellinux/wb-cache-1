40|$|Abstract. V-shape <b>adapter</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} used hollow <b>adapter</b> in submarine-lunched missile, {{studying}} on influence of mechanical property of <b>adapter</b> on submarine-launched performance has an important significance. Firstly, mechanical analysis on V-shape <b>adapter</b> is done and the equivalent out-of-plane mechanical property of <b>adapter</b> is obtained. Secondly, the equivalent constitutive model is built and the user subroutine VUMAT is developed based on ABAQUS/Explicit, while the stability and reliability of the calculation results are verified. According to the requirements of <b>adapter</b> performance from submarine-lunched missile, optimization design for <b>adapter</b> is carried out. The results show that the equivalent constitutive model can simplify the simulation of <b>adapter</b> and shorten the engineering time in research, and the optimized <b>adapter</b> can have a good effect on vibration reduction and supporting based on some relevant conditions...|$|R

5|$|DisplayPort {{connector}} {{is compatible}} with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive <b>adapters</b> or adapter cables. The source device includes a dual-mode transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered <b>adapters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Problems {{were also}} found with the Littlejohn adaptor fitted to the 2-pounder to {{increase}} its range and penetration power; after they had been fitted the <b>adapters</b> could not be removed, and could only fire specially designed armour-piercing rounds, which took time to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI <b>adapters</b> which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI <b>adapters</b> would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, micro-USB {{became the}} defined common {{external}} power supply (EPS) for use with smartphones sold in the EU, 14 of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed the EU's common EPS Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).

5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC <b>adapters</b> exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E
5|$|Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an {{adaptation}} of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and <b>adapters,</b> MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.|$|E
5|$|Portable devices {{having an}} USB On-The-Go port {{may want to}} charge and access USB {{peripheral}} at the same time, but having only a single port (both due to On-The-Go and space requirement) prevents this.

5|$|USB was {{designed}} to standardize the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network <b>adapters)</b> to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power.
