5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story <b>about</b> <b>setting</b> the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate to make that decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} the 2011 neo-noir detective video game L.A. Noire, {{developed}} by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by musicians Andrew Hale and Simon Hale. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, the score also features contributions from Woody Jackson, who had collaborated with Rockstar on previous projects. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was <b>about</b> <b>setting</b> a mood, attempting to compose music that felt accessible to players. The score was inspired by films from the 1940s, though the team avoided specifically composing for this time period, instead opting {{to focus on that}} after the music had been produced. Three supplementary vocal recordings were composed by The Real Tuesday Weld and performed by Claudia Brücken; they also sought to fit with the game's setting.|$|E

Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is <b>about</b> <b>setting</b> other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving yourself the chance to stand out. He moved to Los Angeles the following year, and again auditioned for Whose Line, this time making the cut and was asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go.

25|$|Rapolinis {{was also}} active in {{translation}} work. He evaluated the catechism translated by Jan Seklucjan into Polish and approved it {{for use in}} the Bishopric of Pomesania despite some criticism and resistance from the clergy. He worked on a translation of the Bible into Polish. Surviving letters show that Rapolionis corresponded with Bernard Wojewodka, a printer in Kraków, <b>about</b> <b>setting</b> up a shop in Königsberg for the purpose of printing the Polish Bible. Rapolinis translated at least one hymn into Lithuanian. It seems that he translated it from the original Latin Patris sapientia, veritas divina instead of using Polish or German translations. It has ten stanzas eight lines each. The hymn was published as Giesme ape kenteghima Jhesaus Christaus amszinoija Diewa sunaus in 1570 in the hymnal of Martynas Mažvydas and it is the only undisputed surviving text by Rapolionis in the Lithuanian language. Researchers believe that Rapolionis started translating the Bible into Lithuanian, though there is no direct evidence.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} polynomial-time {{algorithm}} for a restricted form of qualitative reasoning <b>about</b> <b>sets.</b> The algorithm decides satisfiability of set {{expressions of the}} type XrY where r {{is one of the}} three relations of subset, disjointness and non-equality. The algorithm also handles certain disjunctions of such expressions. With the aid of this algorithm, we construct a straightforward, tractable algorithm for the Horn fragment of the spatial theory RCC 5. The algorithm also enables us to show certain topological properties of RCC- 5. For instance, we show that a result by Grigni et al about RCC- 5 restricted to two-dimensional space does not hold for RCC- 5 restricted to three-dimensional space. 195 1 Introduction Reasoning <b>about</b> <b>sets</b> has proved itself useful {{in a number of areas}} in computer science.

40|$|Automated {{reasoning}} <b>about</b> <b>sets</b> {{has received}} {{a considerable amount of}} interest in the literature. Techniques for such reasoning have been used in, for instance, analyses of programming languages, terminological logics and spatial reasoning. In this paper, we identify a new class of set constraints where checking satisfiability is tractable (i. e. polynomial-time). We show how to use this tractability result for constructing a new tractable fragment of intuitionistic logic. Furthermore, we prove NP-completeness of several other cases of reasoning <b>about</b> <b>sets.</b> 1 Introduction There has been considerable interest in formalisms for describing and reasoning <b>about</b> <b>sets.</b> We begin by describing some of these. The most well-studied class of set constraints is, probably, Herbrand set constraints. Such have been suggested as a formalism for describing relationships between sets of terms of a free algebra. A positive set constraint has the form X ` Y, where X and Y are set expressions. Examples of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The SEt Reasoning Facility (SERF) {{integrates}} {{mechanisms for}} propagating membership propositions, deriving relations between <b>sets,</b> and reasoning <b>about</b> closure and cardinality into an efficient utility package for reasoning <b>about</b> <b>sets.</b> Assertions <b>about</b> relations between <b>sets</b> are compiled into a constraint network defined entirely {{in terms of}} union, complement, and emptiness constraints. The constraint network supports multiple modes of inference, such as local prop-agation of membership propositions and graph search for set relations. SERF permits closure assertions of the form "all members of set S are known " and utilizes this capability to permit selective applications of closed-world assump-tions. Cardinality constraints are handled by a general quantity reasoner.

25|$|The {{population}} of Nuristan is ethnically {{distinct from the}} rest of Afghanistan, and divided into four major groups, the Kom, Kata, Kushtoz, and Kalasha. These subgroups were in turn divided into different clans and sects of the Islamic religion, depending on lineages and the interpretations of individual religious leaders. These groups could clash violently over water rights, pasture, and religious beliefs. Five different languages and various dialects are spoken by these groups, making translators from other areas of Afghanistan useless. The Soviets had to contend with a rebel group known as the Dawlet of eastern Nuristan. They were professing a Salafi version of Islam, and hostile to any political rivals. The Nuristanis had resisted Islam as late as the year 1895 and before that had been considered a nation of infidels with a long tradition of violently resisting outsiders, their beliefs, and their invasions. Resistance in Nuristan revolved around a specific group of Islamic fighters known as Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin or HIG. During the Soviet occupation HIG received more support from the CIA than any other Mujahideen resistance group. When it came to infiltration from Pakistan, and setting up ambushes, HIG was regarded as the most skillful. In 2006 HIG was actively resisting the Afghan government. When Captain Aaron Swain of Cherokee Co. had sounded out Afghan Border Police Commander Ahmed Shah <b>about</b> <b>setting</b> up near Kamdesh, he was told that HIG insurgents tried to blow up Shah’s jeep on his last trip there and it was a bad place.|$|E

500|$|Woo {{is a fan}} of jazz {{music and}} wanted this style for the soundtrack of Hard Boiled. Woo had also {{previously}} wanted a singer to perform a jazz song and have Chow Yun Fat's character play saxophone in his previous film The Killer. The producer for The Killer, Tsui Hark, rejected this idea for The Killer, feeling that Hong Kong audiences didn't enjoy and understand jazz music. The score heard in Hard Boiled was created by jazz musician Michael Gibbs. During promotional screenings, the score for the film was different and was described as [...] "very haunting music" [...] by film scholar Bey Logan. This score could not be used as the production crew could not get the rights to the music. Other songs featured in the film, include [...] "Hello" [...] by Lionel Richie and the traditional song [...] "Mona Lisa". Woo chose these songs specifically for their lyrics to suggest that Tony was a sort of pen pal to Teresa. All the characters in Hard Boiled had their voices dubbed by their own actors in order to save money.

In this case category theory {{provides a}} natural way to describe the relation between mathematics and metamathematics: if metamathematics can be described by using categories (in particular syntactic categories), then the mathematical level is represented by internal categories. Through this two-level interpretation we can clarify the relation between classes and sets in ZF and, in particular, we can present two equivalent categorical notions of definable set.
