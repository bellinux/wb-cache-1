40|$|It is {{well known}} that the three <b>altitudes</b> <b>of</b> a {{triangle}} are concurrent at the so-called orthocenter of the triangle. So one might expect that the <b>altitudes</b> <b>of</b> a tetrahedron also meet at a point.

5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission <b>altitude</b> <b>of</b> 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E

30|$|Resonant {{fluorescence}} {{has been}} used in previous research to detect metal vapors at <b>altitudes</b> <b>of</b> about 100  km. Collins et al.

Considering that the density of N+ exceeds that of N 2 + at <b>altitudes</b> <b>of</b> 200 to 300  km and that dipole N+ transitions lie within the spectral band of the second harmonic of Nd:YAG laser radiation, the possibility exists for detection of this radiation scattering in the ionospheric F 2 layer.|$|R
