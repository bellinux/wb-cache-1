While his {{assertion}} was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the mass extinctions {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.|$|E

The duration of the K-T extinction event was less than 10 ky, and the time span is too short to be explained by Deccan volcanism. Geophysical models and high-precision radiometric dating suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, and potentially, could have triggered eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{passage of}} the Marshall Plan, the other {{far-reaching}} implication of the Czech coup for U.S. foreign policy was to heed Bevin's call for a Western defence association. He had found the Truman Administration reluctant to accept an unambiguous and binding alliance with Western Europe even after the irretrievable breakdown of the Council of Foreign Ministers conference in London in December 1947; Marshall {{was not prepared to}} <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> in discussions with Bevin that 17 December.|$|E

He was its leader, denouncing the corruption of Prince George's entourage and the ruler's inability to persuade the Great Powers to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Crete's union with Greece. The Powers, especially Russia and Austria-Hungary, adamantly opposed union for fear it would disrupt the fragile political equilibrium in Europe, particularly in the Balkans. Additionally, they were unwilling to appease Greece, with its famously weak army and navy, at the expense of alienating Turkey.|$|E

This was a dramatic step, even for the National Party, but it was the pragmatic and moderate attitude of Mandela and Mbeki that {{played a crucial role in}} paving the way forward. Both of them reassured the National Party that the mass Black constituency would <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of negotiations. A new constitutional order was in the offing. As a sign of goodwill, De Klerk set free a few of the ANC's top leadership at the end of 1989, among them Govan Mbeki.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, France {{refused to}} <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that courts could quash {{legislation}} enacted by Parliament (though administrative courts could quash regulations {{produced by the}} executive). This {{goes back to the}} French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power not to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were then prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, it seemed that if courts could quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, it would introduce legal uncertainties: how could a citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could a posteriori be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying the consequences of international treaties, including law of the European Union, as superior to national law.|$|E
25|$|During recent decades, {{many people}} in the West have {{developed}} an interest in reincarnation. Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of reincarnation including certain contemporary people who were from Catholic families, modern Neopagans, followers of Spiritism, Theosophists and students of esoteric philosophies such as Kabbalah, and Gnostic and Esoteric Christianity as well as followers of Indian religions. Demographic survey data from 1999â€“2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America, where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition, believe we had a life before we were born, will survive death and be born again physically. The mean for the Nordic countries is 22%. The belief in reincarnation is particularly high in the Baltic countries, with Lithuania having the highest figure for the whole of Europe, 44%. The lowest figure is in East Germany, 12%. In Russia, about one-third believes in reincarnation. The effect of communist anti-religious ideas on the beliefs of the populations of Eastern Europe seems to have been rather slight, if any, except apparently in East Germany. Overall, 22% of respondents in Western Europe believe in reincarnation. According to a 2005 Gallup poll 20 percent of U.S. adults believe in reincarnation. Recent surveys by the Barna Group, a Christian research nonprofit organization, have found that a quarter of U.S. Christians, including 10 percent of all born again Christians, embrace the idea.|$|E

[...] "To do this, I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within my party and the country."

[...] Initially, Salke and Korman hoped to sell acquisition rights to other networks (including Fox). Although it successfully made its way into the lower executive branches of the company, the script was ultimately declined by Fox entertainment president Kevin Reilly. Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, opted not to develop a deal with cable-television networks.

[...] Stone's friends often felt differently about the issue; [...] "Nettee" [...] Brown wrote to Stone in 1853 that she was not ready to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> even if both parties wanted divorce. Stanton was less inclined to clerical orthodoxy; she was very much in favor of giving women the right to divorce, eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than women's voting rights.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Lana, Clark had {{a growing}} {{relationship}} with Lois. Season five saw the melting {{of the ice}} between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, {{and the fact that}} both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life. His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time.|$|E
500|$|Suggestions for {{introducing}} a [...] "dark horse" [...] candidate {{began to take}} place. Members backing each candidate were equally determined to win the nomination, but some felt that the deadlock could not be broken if new candidates were not introduced into the balloting. Backers for Sherman and Blaine met after the convention was adjourned. Chandler laid down his terms. Blaine had nearly 300 votes, and could not simply withdraw. As Chandler explained, even [...] "f Mr. Blaine permits his column to be broken, [...] Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Nevada, California, Oregon & twelve votes in the Territories will go to Grant... Mr. Blaine's Southern votes." [...] Both sides argued until two or three in the morning, but no decision had been reached. Grant leaders had also met that night in Roscoe Conkling's suite in the Grand Pacific Hotel. They discussed the imposing dangers of Grant's nomination bid, such as the third-term resistors. Many speculated that Grant {{was not going to}} receive the nomination. The Grant backers discussed the other two chief candidates, and found them both to be unacceptable. Some of the men called for Conkling himself as a substitute for Grant. They argued that with Grant out of the race, Conkling would face little resistance for the Republican nomination. However, Conkling refused to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of being nominated for president. He said [...] " [...] if I were to receive every other vote in the Convention, my own would still be lacking, and that I would not give.
