25|$|In the 33 matches {{he played}} for South Africa, {{he was on the}} winning side 21 times, against only two losses.

25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|Monmouth was {{beheaded}} by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685, on Tower Hill. Shortly beforehand, Bishops Turner of Ely and Ken of Bath and Wells {{visited the}} condemned man to prepare him for eternity, but withheld the Eucharist as {{he refused to}} acknowledge that either his rebellion or his relationship with Lady Wentworth had been sinful. It is said that before laying {{his head to the}} block Monmouth specifically bade Ketch finish him at one blow, saying he had mauled others before. Disconcerted, Ketch did indeed inflict multiple blows with his axe, the prisoner rising up reproachfully the while – <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> sight that shocked the witnesses, drawing forth execrations and groans. Some say a knife was at last employed to sever the head from the twitching body. Sources vary; some claim eight blows, the official Tower of London fact sheet says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, puts it at seven.|$|E

25|$|During {{the evening}} of 22 April 1915, German pioneers {{released}} chlorine gas which drifted into {{the positions of the}} French 87th Territorial and the 45th Algerian divisions, {{on the north side of}} the salient and caused many of the troops to run back from the cloud, leaving a gap in the Allied line. The German attack was a strategic diversion, rather than a breakthrough attempt and insufficient forces were available to follow up the success. As soon as German troops tried to advance into areas not affected by the gas, Allied small-arms and artillery fire dominated the area and halted the German advance. The surprise gained against the French, was increased by the lack of protection against gas and because the psychological effect of the unpredictable nature of the substance. A soldier could evade bullets and shells but gas seeped into trenches and dugouts and had <b>a</b> <b>ghastly,</b> slow choking effect. The gas was quickly identified as chlorine and the first Allied mass-produced anti-gas helmet was a flannel bag soaked in glycerine, hyposulphite and sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
25|$|The IV Cavalry Corps {{was engaged}} at the Battle of Borodino on 7 September 1812. The 4th Light Cavalry Division {{deployed}} three regiments of Polish uhlans (lancers) backed by two Polish horse artillery batteries. The 7th Heavy Cavalry Division counted two regiments of Saxon, two of Westphalian, {{and one of}} Polish cuirassiers, supported by one Saxon and one Westphalian horse artillery batteries. See Orders of Battle: Borodino 1812. The final attack on the Great Redoubt occurred at 2:00 PM. Prince Eugène de Beauharnais sent three infantry divisions in a frontal attack, while the III Cavalry Corps advanced {{on the left and}} the II Cavalry Corps and IV Cavalry Corps advanced on the right. The cavalry on the right-hand side soon trotted past the marching infantry and drove for {{the left side of the}} redoubt. According to the Saxon colonel of the Zastrow Regiment, the young-looking La Tour-Maubourg deftly led the corps past the left end of the redoubt. Galloping over dead bodies from the earlier fighting, Lorge's cuirassiers were the first into the fieldwork. Some cavalrymen forced their way through embrasures while others swept around the rear. Massed inside the Great Redoubt, the Russian infantry refused to give up as infantrymen and horsemen engaged in a wild frenzy of slaughter. When the French infantry finally burst into the fieldwork from the front, they quickly massacred the remaining defenders. Witnesses later described <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> scene with some corpses torn apart by artillery fire and others stacked several layers deep.|$|E
500|$|The news of Sinclair's C5 project {{came as a}} {{surprise}} when it became public and attracted considerable interest, as well as scepticism. The Economist reported in June 1983 that carmakers were [...] "startled" [...] but cautious about Sinclair's prospects; as one competitor put it, [...] "If it were anyone but Sinclair, we'd say he was bonkers". The Economist asked, [...] "Can a man who has made a fortune out of calculators and computers, and could double it on flatscreen televisions, be that crazy?" [...] and wondered whether he was [...] "making <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> mistake", a prediction that industry insiders thought was likely.|$|E

500|$|The show's {{cast and}} crew {{repeatedly}} praised Vincent Kartheiser for his professionalism and ability to bring much to his character. [...] "You can bet the family fortune on this kid, he can really do it," [...] stated director Vern Gillum. Producer Tim Minear described Vincent {{as one of the}} main reasons of their avoidance of giving the character <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> send-off as planned before, “We’ve all grown so fond of the character and the actor that we didn’t want do that.” Although fans and critics reception to Kartheiser’s portrayal of the disturbed teen was also very positive, the character and his storylines turned out to be controversial.|$|E

They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed it in such <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{was introduced in}} Batman #1 (1940), in which he announces that he will kill three of Gotham's prominent citizens (including Mayor Henry Claridge). Although the police protect Claridge, the Joker had poisoned him before making his announcement and Claridge dies with <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> grin on his face; Batman eventually defeats him, sending him to prison. The Joker commits whimsical, brutal crimes for reasons that, in Batman's words, [...] "make sense to him alone". Detective Comics #168 (1951) introduced the Joker's first origin story as Red Hood: a criminal who, during his final heist, vanishes after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement led him to adopt the name [...] "Joker", from the playing card figure he came to resemble. The Joker's Silver-Age transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952's [...] "The Joker's Millions". In this story the Joker is obsessed with maintaining his illusion of wealth and celebrity as a criminal folk hero, afraid to let Gotham's citizens {{know that he is}} penniless and was tricked out of his fortune. The 1970s redefined the character as a homicidal psychopath. [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge" [...] has the Joker taking violent revenge on the former gang members who betrayed him; in [...] "The Laughing Fish" [...] the character chemically adds his face to Gotham's fish (hoping to profit from a copyright), killing bureaucrats who stand in his way.|$|E

500|$|While away seeing Juno Delia {{discovers the}} {{handbook}} and reads it. Although Adam and Barbara remain invisible to Charles and Delia, Lydia {{can see the}} ghost couple and befriends them. Against Juno's advice, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, Juno's former assistant and now freelance [...] "bio-exorcist" [...] ghost, to scare away the Deetzes. At first, they are unaware that [...] "Betelgeuse" [...] is pronounced [...] "Beetlejuice", {{which is why they}} have such difficulty pronouncing his name and thereby summoning him. However, Betelgeuse quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor; and they reconsider hiring him, though too late to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts. Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, Otho conducts what he thinks is a séance and summons Adam and Barbara, but they begin to decay and die, as Otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead. Horrified, Lydia begrudgingly summons Betelgeuse for help; but he agrees to help her only on the condition that she marry him, enabling him to freely cause chaos in the mortal world. Betelgeuse saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie, his wife, and Otho, then prepares a wedding before <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> minister. The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is completed, with Barbara riding a sandworm through the house to devour Betelgeuse.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{claimed that}} it was his 1940 card sketch that served as the character's concept, and which Finger {{associated}} with Veidt's portrayal. Kane hired the 17-year-old Robinson as an assistant in 1939, after he saw Robinson in a white jacket decorated with his own illustrations. Beginning as a letterer and background inker, Robinson quickly became primary artist for the newly created Batman comic book series. In a 1975 interview in The Amazing World of DC Comics, Robinson said he wanted a supreme arch-villain who could test Batman, but not a typical crime lord or gangster designed to be easily disposed. He wanted an exotic, enduring character as an ongoing source of conflict for Batman (similar to the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty), designing a diabolically sinister-but-clownish villain. Robinson was intrigued by villains; his studies at Columbia University taught him that some characters are made up of contradictions, leading to the Joker's sense of humor. He said that the name came first, followed by an image of a playing card from a deck he often had at hand: [...] "I wanted somebody visually exciting. I wanted somebody that would make an indelible impression, would be bizarre, would be memorable like the Hunchback of Notre Dame or any other villains that had unique physical characters." [...] He told Finger about his concept by telephone, later providing sketches of the character and images of what would become his iconic Joker playing-card design. Finger thought the concept was incomplete, providing the image of Veidt with <b>a</b> <b>ghastly,</b> permanent rictus grin.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but he can be <b>a</b> <b>ghastly</b> writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs {{to be given a}} travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E
