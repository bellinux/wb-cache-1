500|$|Robinson {{settled in}} the village of Langrish, near Petersfield in east Hampshire. He died peacefully at Haslar Naval Hospital, Gosport, on 20 August 1965 and was laid to rest at St John's, the village church he had served for 20 years as warden. For unknown reasons, his grave was without a headstone until 1998, {{although}} a large plaque to him was dedicated by his sister in 1969 and surmounts the altar. Following investigations by the Naval VC Association, his grave was discovered and a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone erected. At the dedication ceremony, attended [...] by over 150 friends, relatives, Masons and servicemen, Admiral Derek Reffell gave the eulogy which stated: [...] "The admiral was a hero, but more importantly he was a naval man from the finest mould. Now <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> can accord him the dignity he deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|After twelve rehearsals, the {{orchestra}} {{made its debut}} at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. [...] After the first item, Berlioz's Roman Carnival Overture, the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. In The Sunday Times Ernest Newman wrote, [...] "Nothing so electrifying has been heard in a London concert room for years. The tone was magnificent, the precision perfect, the reading a miracle of fire and beauty, and the enthusiasm of the audience {{could not have been}} greater." [...] In The Times H C Colles said that the LPO was [...] "as fine an instrument as could be wished for"; Neville Cardus wrote in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "nothing more sumptuous and daring in orchestral playing could be heard in more than three other cities between New York and Vienna"; and W J Turner, of The Illustrated London News, praised {{the orchestra}}'s [...] "youthful dash and virtuosity... <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> have an independent orchestra which rivals the BBC Symphony Orchestra".|$|E

2500|$|We {{resolved}} not {{to embarrass}} a family, {{in a time}} of so much sorrow, if any other expedient could he found; and as the Island of Ulva was over-against us, it was determined that we should pass the strait and have recourse to the Laird, who, like the other gentlemen of the Islands, was known to Col. [...] We expected to find a ferry-boat, but when <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> came to the water, the boat was gone.|$|E
2500|$|By now my {{dysentery}} was so violent I was draining blood. Every {{one of the}} men {{was sick}} from one cause or another. My shoulders were worn raw from the pack straps, and I left the pack behind... The boys with me weren't in much better shape... A scout moving ahead suddenly held his rifle high in the air. That meant Enemy sighted... Then <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> saw them, coming down the railroad four abreast... The gunner crouched low over his tommy-gun and tightened down. Then the gun spoke. Down flopped a half-dozen Japs, then another half dozen. The [...] column spewed from their marching formation into the bush. We grabbed up the gun and slid back into the jungle. Sometimes staggering, sometimes running, sometimes dragging, I made it back to camp. I was so sick I didn't care whether the Japs broke through or not; so sick I didn't worry any more about letting the colonel down. All I wanted was unconsciousness.|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. <b>At</b> <b>last,</b> <b>we</b> arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>At</b> <b>last,</b> when <b>we</b> {{were both}} {{overwhelmed}} and gasping for breath, I refused flatly to ask anything more, whereon she ceased her examinations, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a dreadful}} muddle, Aunt Margaret;--but {{it has come}} right <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> and <b>we</b> had better not talk about that part of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{seems as}} though you’re {{standing}} on your own legs <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> Hump,” <b>we</b> heard him say; and then for some time he was silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] cried Turnbull, {{waving his}} fragment; [...] "we are safe <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> <b>We</b> are free <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> <b>We</b> are somewhere better than England or Eden or Paradise. MacIan, {{we are in}} the Land of the Duel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus Poldon top <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> won, [...] <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> won, And {{gained the}} inn at sink of sun [...] Far-famed as [...] "Marshal's Elm."

60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> {{had come}} close to a {{solution}} of our problem--the road to Sari.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{three weeks}} we cruised about, sailing round island after island, but <b>at</b> <b>last</b> as <b>we</b> were {{approaching}} {{one of them}} I saw the three trees.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last,</b> however, <b>we</b> {{were taken}} {{off by a}} three-masted {{schooner}} bound for San Francisco, at which city we arrived in due time and in good health and condition.|$|R
6000|$|The watch was ended <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> and <b>we</b> took {{supper and}} went to bed. At midnight the glare of a lantern shone in my eyes, and the night {{watchman}} said-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> {{began to}} get hungry, and Phil hauled some {{crackers}} from the provision box.|$|E
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> were ready, {{and this}} time the {{sergeant}} did not propose that I lead the way.|$|E
60|$|It grew {{darker and}} darker, but <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> saw, not far {{in front of}} us, a light.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all; {{we should}} stifle {{ourselves}} <b>at</b> <b>last</b> if <b>we</b> {{had our own}} way. Never mind, Leonard, we make them go through quite {{as much as they}} make us.' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus came we out of {{the town}} and to the shady banks of the gleaming Po. And then, <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> when <b>we</b> were quite alone, and within two hundred yards of Fifanti's house, I broke <b>at</b> <b>last</b> the silence.|$|R
6000|$|Devereux. In Inglestadt {{there was}} just such another-- [...] 125 [...] His whole skin {{was the same as}} steel; <b>at</b> <b>last</b> [...] <b>We</b> were obliged to beat him down with gunstocks.|$|R

60|$|When <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> {{reached the}} house and stood inside the hall, {{he turned to me}} and spoke for the first time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A good man,' {{said the}} grandfather, looking after him; 'a kind man. Surely {{he will never}} harm us, Nell. We are safe here, <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> eh? <b>We</b> will never go away from here?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last,</b> however, <b>we</b> halted <b>at</b> its farther end, and whilst I {{was still}} trying to pierce the gloom a great gust of air came tearing down it, and {{extinguished}} both the lamps.|$|R
60|$|Things drew {{to an end}} <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{but after}} <b>we</b> had spoken of a {{thousand}} things.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>we</b> {{heard the}} front door shut behind them, and my father came upstairs, his usually serene face wearing a {{disturbed}} expression.|$|E

6000|$|... "How's this, Master Western?" [...] demanded Cap, with {{sufficient}} fierceness for the occasion; [...] "are you running us into Frontenac <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> and <b>we</b> all asleep below, {{like so many}} mariners waiting for the 'sentry go'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Bessie got up {{and showed}} her a pale serious face—bending it on her for some time, confessing silently and, a little, pleading. “I told him,” the girl said <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> “that <b>we</b> couldn’t go to Branches.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last,</b> when <b>we</b> {{two were}} {{alone on the}} summit of the rock on a bright morning, I put in some hint about a bribe. He looked at me, cast back his head, and laughed out loud.|$|R
