5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|Cone colour <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to help {{determine}} the degree of maturation, but cones may be red, pink or green (Teich 1970). Collection and storage dates and conditions influence germination requirements and early seedling growth (Zasada 1973, Edwards 1977, Winston and Haddon 1981).|$|E
25|$|Winter oats may {{be grown}} as an {{off-season}} groundcover and ploughed under {{in the spring}} as a green fertilizer, or harvested in early summer. They <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for pasture; they can be grazed a while, then allowed to head out for grain production, or grazed continuously until other pastures are ready.|$|E
25|$|In a more {{contemporary}} {{version of the}} Chinese model, a courtyard can <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to separate a home into wings; for example, one wing of the house may be for entertaining/dining, and the other wing may be for sleeping/family/privacy. This is exemplified by the Hooper House in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Lift bags <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for static lifts, {{where the}} bag is {{anchored}} {{in place by}} rigging, and used as a lifting point with very high buoyancy compared to the load, which is then lifted {{in a controlled manner}} using a purchase or chain block or other suitable lifting device.|$|E
25|$|While unsubstituted poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) is {{typically}} insoluble, {{a number of}} PPVs and related poly(naphthalene vinylene)s (PNVs) that are soluble in organic solvents or water have been prepared via ring opening metathesis polymerization. These water-soluble polymers or conjugated poly electrolytes (CPEs) <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as hole injection layers alone or in combination with nanoparticles like graphene.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinction}} between NetTutor {{and other services}} is that a set of written guidelines is drawn up in consultation with client institutions and amended as needed. Such guidelines reinforce tutoring best practices, such as that tutors should prefer the Socratic method and scaffolding over simply answering questions. However, they <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to instruct tutors to adopt special practices preferred by the client. Some examples of tutoring guidelines {{are available on the}} Web.|$|E

50|$|Suitability {{analysis}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to track}} and label potential hazards, like earthquakes, contamination, or even crime. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to locate advantageous locations for commercial centers.|$|R
50|$|Irradiation of {{polyimide}} resists {{have potential}} to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as templates for nanowire growth.Tracks <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to sputter materials.They <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to elongate nanocrystals embedded in materials.|$|R
25|$|The heat {{equation}} governs heat diffusion, {{as well as}} other diffusive processes, such as particle diffusion or the propagation of action potential in nerve cells. Although they are not diffusive in nature, some quantum mechanics problems are also governed by a mathematical analog of the {{heat equation}} (see below). It <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to model some phenomena arising in finance, like the Black–Scholes or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The equation, and various non-linear analogues, has also been used in image analysis.|$|E
25|$|Spark {{testing is}} a method of {{determining}} the general classification of ferrous materials. It normally entails taking a piece of metal, usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted. These sparks {{can be compared to}} a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification. Spark testing <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to sort ferrous materials, establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different.|$|E
25|$|Although tilt {{and swing}} are {{normally}} used {{to maximize the}} part of the image that is within the DOF, they <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> in combination with a small f-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be interesting because it differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.|$|E
50|$|The {{co-monomer}} {{is typically}} dioxolane but ethylene oxide <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> Dioxolane <b>is</b> formed by reaction of ethylene glycol with aqueous formaldehyde over an acid catalyst. Other diols <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|R
30|$|C_o^α l + 1 <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{computed}} <b>using</b> model (21) after replacing {{time period}} l with l + 1.|$|R
50|$|TETRIX PRIME was {{developed}} for middle school <b>use</b> but <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> with TETRIX MAX components. The systems <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> with R/C controllers or a variety or programmable options such as myRIO and Arduino.|$|R
25|$|Like PET, SPECT <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to {{differentiate}} {{different kinds of}} disease processes which produce dementia, and it is increasingly used for this purpose. Neuro-PET has a disadvantage of requiring use of tracers with half-lives of at most 110 minutes, such as FDG. These must be made in a cyclotron, and are expensive or even unavailable if necessary transport times are prolonged {{more than a few}} half-lives. SPECT, however, is able to make use of tracers with much longer half-lives, such as technetium-99m, and as a result, is far more widely available.|$|E
25|$|Population {{substructure}} <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to {{advantage in}} genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of geographically separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range linkage disequilibrium between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers {{than is the}} case for other populations. Genetic studies can use this admixture linkage disequilibrium to search for disease alleles with fewer markers than would be needed otherwise. Association studies also {{can take advantage of the}} contrasting experiences of racial or ethnic groups, including migrant groups, to search for interactions between particular alleles and environmental factors that might influence health.|$|E
25|$|However, Georgia's defence {{ministry}} released video {{the next}} day showing {{what appears to be}} a Russian MiG-29 shooting down the unarmed Georgian drone. , shot from the drone, shows a jet launching a missile over what appears to be the Black Sea. Moscow denied Georgia's accusation and stressed that none of its planes were in the region at the time. Furthermore, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement accusing Georgia of violating the 1994 Moscow agreement and United Nations resolutions on Abkhazia by deploying without authorisation a UAV which <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for adjusting of fire.|$|E
50|$|Advanced {{directives}} <b>also</b> <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in Canada to {{give consent}} for voluntary euthanasia, {{a practice that}} Belgium allows.|$|R
50|$|Asphaltene aggregation, {{precipitation}} or deposition <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{predicted by}} modeling or artificial intelligent methods. It <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> measured <b>using</b> imaging methods or filtration.|$|R

25|$|Multimodality <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to {{associate}} a text {{with a specific}} argumentative purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a value judgment, or make a policy decision. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text’s stasis can be altered by multimodality, especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, {{it can also be}} assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something is good or bad. If the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.|$|E
25|$|US {{military}} {{resources can}} be used as part of a counter-drug (CD) component of a FID program. While these are most often focused on supply, they <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to interfere with drug shipment. Since the United States Department of Defense is the lead government agency of the USG for the detection and monitoring (DM) of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs into the US, the DM mission is performed with regularly appropriated funds, notwithstanding the possibility of incidental benefit to the HN. Such activities may include nonconfrontational intercepts for intelligence or communication purposes and gathering and processing of tactical intelligence from a variety of sources, including fixed and mobile surveillance assets and certain intelligence sharing. In a CD support role (subject to national policy and legislative guidance) DOD may offer certain direct support to HN CD personnel, and certain enhanced support to US civilian law enforcement agencies that may be operating in the HN, and to the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement of the United States Department of State.|$|E
500|$|The same method <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a {{subroutine}} {{when the}} individual cluster diameters are unknown. To test whether a given sum of diameters {{can be achieved}} without knowing the individual cluster diameters, one may try all maximal pairs of target diameters that add up to at most the given sum, representing each pair of diameters as a 2-satisfiability instance and using a 2-satisfiability algorithm to determine whether that pair can be realized by a clustering. To find the optimal sum of diameters one may perform a binary search in which each step is a feasibility test of this type. The same approach also works to find clusterings that optimize other combinations than sums of the cluster diameters, and that use arbitrary dissimilarity numbers (rather than distances in a metric space) to measure {{the size of a}} cluster. The time bound for this algorithm is dominated by the time to solve a sequence of 2-satisfiability instances that are closely related to each other, and [...] shows how to solve these related instances more quickly than if they were solved independently from each other, leading to a total time bound of [...] for the sum-of-diameters clustering problem.|$|E
50|$|Thionine is a {{strongly}} staining metachromatic dye, which <b>is</b> widely <b>used</b> for biological staining. Thionine <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{in place of}} Schiff reagent in quantitative Feulgen staining of DNA.
