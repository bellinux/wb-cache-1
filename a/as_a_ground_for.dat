Under federal law enacted in 1994, sexual conduct between consenting adults (18 {{years of age or}} older) is their private matter {{throughout}} Australia, irrespective of marital status.

500|$|The main {{usage of}} zinc oxide (zinc white) was in paints {{and as an}} {{additive}} to ointments. Zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 {{but it did not}} mix well with oil. This problem was solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO. In 1845, LeClaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale, and by 1850, zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe. The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead: zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight, it is not blackened by sulfur-bearing air, it is non-toxic and more economical. Because zinc white is so [...] "clean" [...] it is valuable for making tints with other colors, but it makes a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors. For example, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, some artists used zinc white <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> their oil paintings. All those paintings developed cracks over the years.|$|E

2500|$|Article 62 (LXII) of the Treaty of Berlin, 13 July 1878 {{dealt with}} {{religious}} freedom and {{civil and political}} rights {{in all parts of the}} Ottoman Empire. The guarantees have frequently been referred to as [...] "religious rights" [...] or [...] "minority rights". However, the guarantees included a prohibition against discrimination in civil and political matters. Difference of religion could not be alleged against any person <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> exclusion or incapacity in matters relating to the enjoyment of civil or political rights, admission to public employments, functions, and honours, or the exercise of the various professions and industries, [...] "in any locality whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Same-sex {{marriages in}} the UK give all {{the rights and}} {{responsibilities}} of civil marriage and can be performed on approved premises. This also includes religious venues, providing the religious or belief body has opted in. However, no religious or belief body is compelled to perform same-sex marriages; the Church of England and the Church in Wales are explicitly banned from doing so. For {{the purposes of the}} divorce of a same-sex marriage, the common law definition of adultery remains as sexual intercourse {{between a man and a}} woman only, although infidelity with a person of the same sex can be grounds for a divorce as [...] "unreasonable behaviour." [...] Non-consummation is also excluded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the annulment of a same-sex marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Persecution on {{the basis}} of sexual {{orientation}} is not explicitly recognized in law <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> granting refugee status. Same sex partners are not recognized for the purposes of immigration law. After the fall of the communist regime many Belarusians requested and were granted political asylum abroad, based on fear of persecution because of their sexual orientation. The most frequent reason cited was formal or informal harassment by the police. Amnesty International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Network – Belarus (AILGBT-Belarus) has information on individuals who were granted asylum in Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, and Sweden.

2500|$|In July 2004, Abdurahman Khadr {{was denied}} a Canadian {{passport}} by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on the explicit advice of her Foreign Affairs Minister, Bill Graham, who stated {{the decision was}} [...] "in {{the interest of the}} national security of Canada and the protection of Canadian troops in Afghanistan." [...] The government invoked Royal Prerogative in order to deny Khadr's passport, as national security was not at that time listed in the Canadian Passport Order <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> refusal. Shortly thereafter, on September 22, 2004, section 10.1 was added to the order, which allowed the minister to revoke or refuse a passport due to national security concerns. Khadr sought judicial review of the minister's decision to refuse his passport and, on June 8 of the following year, the Federal Court ruled that the government did not have the power to refuse to issue Khadr's passport in the absence of specific authority set out in the Canadian Passport Order, but stated in obiter dicta that if the order were to be amended, Khadr would likely not be able to challenge the revocation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{coming to}} his {{decision}} in the present case, Menon highlighted the principle upon which apparent bias stands <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> judicial review, separate from that of actual bias. Since justice is rooted in public confidence, {{it is imperative that}} [...] "right-minded people" [...] not hold the impression that [...] "the judge was biased". The appearance of impartiality is as important as actual impartiality, because there is public interest in ensuring that justice is seen to be done. The reasonable suspicion test upholds this principle as it [...] "safeguards not only the fact but also the appearance of justice being done". Thus he held this to be the more appropriate test because the inquiry is focused on whether a reasonable member of the public would have the impression that the public authority acted with bias, regardless of whether the court thought it likely or possible. On the other hand, the adoption of the real likelihood test would shift the focus of the inquiry {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable person to that of a judge who is no longer concerned strictly with the appearance of bias but rather with establishing whether there is in fact a sufficient possibility of bias.|$|E

2500|$|In foreign policy, {{following}} the September 11, 2001 {{attacks in the}} United States, Blair greatly supported U.S. President George W. Bush's new War on Terror which began with the forced withdrawal of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Blair's case for the subsequent war in Iraq was based on their alleged possession {{of weapons of mass}} destruction and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for regime change, since international law does not recognise this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002 the Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that [...] "the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the [...] "Dodgy Dossier".|$|E
