5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns.

Jackson, a lifelong Bond fan, remarked that as Eon tended to go for less famous directors, he would likely not get another chance to direct a Bond film after The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

5|$|The film's budget {{climbed from}} an initial US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but they liked it so their concerns were addressed.|$|E

5|$|A tile setter, Anthony Cacchio Sr., {{rented the}} {{building}} in 1949 and converted it into a movie theater; it opened on February18, 1949 with <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> the film Blood on the Moon. Cacchio owned the building outright by the mid-1950s. During this time, a severe flood damaged the Theatre's interior, and all the equipment had to be replaced. In its early years, the Theatre showed about 300 different movies each year, making it unpopular with film distributors. Denied easy access to first run films, the Theatre turned to independent movies and art films, and eventually began exhibiting live performances. Cacchio's entire family helped run the Theatre; his wife Fannie sold tickets and determined the Theatre's movie selection, while their sons Anthony Jr. and Rocco, and grandson Michael, ran the projector and eventually managed the day-to-day operation of the business.|$|E
