5|$|Later, Kate {{appears as}} part of Batman and Robin: Blackest Knight. Batwoman is kidnapped by cultists and taken to London in order for her to once again be sacrificed. She is sealed within a coffin and taken {{underground}} to the last remaining Lazarus Pit {{in order for the}} ritual to begin. She is saved by the timely intervention of Dick Grayson and British superheroes Knight and Squire. After learning that Grayson plans on placing Bruce Wayne's corpse into the pit in order to revive him, Kate strongly protests, but he simply ignores her. True to Kate's warnings, Bruce (in reality an insane clone created by Darkseid) emerges from the Pit and attacks the heroes. As the battle takes place, the cultists who kidnapped Kate detonate explosives surrounding the Pit, causing a massive cave-in. Grayson discovers Kate, buried alive and with extensive injury to her spine and legs, and tries to help her. Kate is healed after being placed inside the Pit, and she returns to Gotham with the others. Before leaving to return to her home, Grayson flirts with Kate by telling her that he has <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> red-haired crime-fighters (a reference to his previous love interests, Barbara Gordon and Starfire), apparently unaware of Kate's sexuality.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} {{exposition of}} the principle of relativity necessarily consists very largely in the demonstration of invariant properties of certain mathematical relations. Hence it is bound to appear a little uninteresting to the experimentalist...little is done to remove the unfortunate impression that relativity is a fad of the mathematician, and not <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the every-day physicist.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} century CE, iron mining in swamps started in the easternmost parts of the country. Several small {{communities}} with blast furnaces were established, located several days walk from the good agricultural land, generating trade and occupational specialization. However, the mining industry stopped in the fifth century. In the following centuries, {{as part of the}} increased immigration due to the Migration Period, then a Germanic judicial system was introduced, which was a further development of the system launched during the mining era. In the fifth century, the first organizing of military took place, with constructions of small forts. Around this time, the area was split into counties, with the current Nord-Trøndleag consisting of parts of Stjørdølafylke, Skøynafylke, Øynafylke, Verdølafylke, Sparbyggjafylke and Naumdølafylke. From the tenth century, the Frostating was established as <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> all of the Trondheimsfjord area.|$|E

She cut <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> us to use, and I cut <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> her to use in her show if she wants to do that. It's a cool way to have her be a part of the show even though she's not going to be there every night." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, {{the colonel}} {{and his wife}} wait outside the house in their RV. The Simpsons sneak out with Homer {{clinging}} to an old Christmas tree and search for a temporary home. They find Grampa's old farmhouse on Rural Route 9 outside of Springfield, where, despite the land's poor reputation for growing crops, Homer becomes a farmer. After failing to grow <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> a month, Homer calls Lenny and requests they send plutonium. The crops eventually grow, but since Homer had accidentally mixed the tomato seeds with the tobacco seeds, a new product is created. Homer calls the mutated crop [...] "Tomacco," [...] which tastes terrible, but is highly addictive. [...] Homer and Marge set up a stall, Homer providing tomacco and Marge, fresh-baked mincemeat pie. While the pies do not sell well, the tomacco is such a success that executives from Laramie Cigarettes offer to buy the rights to Tomacco for $150 million.|$|E
2500|$|Novello {{presented}} {{only two}} new shows during the Second World War. Arc de Triomphe (1943), a musical vehicle for Mary Ellis, {{was only a}} modest success, but Perchance to Dream (1945) was immensely successful, running for 1,022 performances. In between the two shows, Novello had been in serious legal trouble and served four weeks in prison for misuse of petrol coupons, a serious offence under rationing laws in wartime Britain. [...] An admiring fan had stolen the coupons from her employer, but {{the court found that}} Novello was also culpable. The prison term, though short, came as a severe shock to Novello, both mentally and physically, and had serious lasting effects. Not everybody was supportive; Coward's sympathy was limited: [...] "He's been fighting like a steer to keep going as before the war and hasn't done <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the general effort", but when Novello returned to The Dancing Years after his release, he received [...] "a rapturous ovation" [...] on his first entrance.|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} the matter, Joan famously said, “It is not {{considered}} ignominious, nor disgraceful for a great earl to take a poor and mean woman to wife; neither, on the other hand, is it worthy of blame, or too difficult <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> a countess to promote to honor a gallant youth.” Joan's statement {{in addition to a}} possibly obvious pregnancy seemed to soften Edward’s attitude towards the situation. [...] Joan's first child by Monthermer was born in October 1297; by the summer of 1297, when the marriage was revealed to Edward I, Joan's condition would certainly have been apparent, and would have convinced Edward that {{he had no choice but}} to recognize his daughter's marriage. Edward I eventually relented for the sake of his daughter and released Monthermer from prison in August 1297. [...] Monthermer paid homage 2 August, and being granted the titles of Earl of Gloucester and Earl of Hertford, he rose to favour with the King during Joan's lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|Ephron first {{conceived}} {{of this story}} in 1999 as an HBO movie. Ephron focused {{the story on the}} career of New York City tabloid columnist Mike McAlary from his early beginnings to his rise to stardom, when he received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for exposing police brutality against a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima in Brooklyn's 70th precinct, and his death, eight months later, of cancer. Ephron, who had been a New York Post reporter, had previously written about her own career in journalism in the novel I Remember Nothing. She once wrote, [...] "I can’t remember which came first—wanting to be a journalist or wanting to date a journalist"; she had <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> journalists like McAlary. Since McAlary lost his battle with cancer, Ephron had spent her six years battling cancer by directing a film and writing two as well as writing two plays; Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune speculates that Ephron chose this subject because she shared a bond with a journalist who [...] "also did some of his best writing while battling cancer".|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi {{employed}} former Rockwell International executive Sam Pitroda as his {{adviser on}} public information infrastructure and innovation. During Gandhi's time in office, public sector telecom companies MTNL and VSNL was developed. According to Pitroda, Gandhi's ability to resist pressure from multi-national companies {{to abandon his}} plan to spread telecommunication services {{has been an important}} factor in India's development. According to news website Oneindia, [...] "About 20 years ago telephones were considered to be <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the use of the rich, but credit goes to Rajiv Gandhi for taking them to the rural masses". Pitroda also said their plan to expand India's telephone network succeeded because of Gandhi's political support. According to Pitroda, by 2007 they were [...] "adding six million phones every month". Gandhi's government also allowed the import of fully assembled motherboards, which led to the price of computers being reduced. According to some commentators, [...] the seed for the information technology (IT) revolution was also planted during Rajiv Gandhi’s time. As Prime Minister he set up the National Informatics Centre and made it easier to import computers while setting up Technology Missions that today provide communication to each village across the country.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{her last}} radio {{appearances}} {{was in an}} episode of the BBC's Desert Island Discs with Roy Plomley. Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{characters}} of Rosario + Vampire have received criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Theron Martin of Anime News Network describes Tsukune as a [...] "cookie-cutter harem male lead, an unfailingly kind-hearted, indecisive wimp who primarily has <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Moka but still treasures {{the other girls}} as friends." [...] Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, in reviewing the manga, noted Tsukune's character design as lazy: [...] "shove in any other male protagonist from a harem series and nobody would notice too much". He found the girls [...] "distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)", but concluded in a later volume that [...] "The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters {{are never going to}} go anywhere, and the artwork is always going to have that same polished-but-flawed look." [...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a [...] "pink-haired dolt"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as walking around in broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as [...] "pretty damn badass", [...] "a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one", and wished that her character was developed better. Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt. Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk noted that Kokoa is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy; however, Høgset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Sendra from Allmusic said: [...] "The {{title of}} Carla Bruni's 2008 album, Comme Si de Rien N'Etait (As If Nothing Had Happened), {{is a good}} joke. After all, since her last album Bruni fell into a {{whirlwind}} romance with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and ended up marrying him and becoming the [...] "First Lady" [...] of France. That's a pretty big [...] "something", and indeed it isn't often that the romance of a singer and a president is chronicled on record as it is here—though {{you need to be}} fluent in French to catch the details, since only her cover of '50s pop classic [...] "You Belong to Me" [...] (which is a witty nod to a semi-scandalous trip the couple took to Egypt and other exotic locales before they were wed) is in English. You don't need to know exactly what's going on lyrically, because the intimate-sounding arrangements on the ballads and the light and breezy sound of the more uptempo tunes clue you in that there is romance in the air. Along with the nice arrangements, the best thing about the album is Bruni's intimate and sultry singing. She can purr like a Gainsbourg girl, strut sassily, or croon quite tenderly—sometimes all within the same song. Most of the time she sounds like you always hoped a '60s French bombshell would sound but never quite did (think Bardot or Birkin). Not surprisingly, Bruni appears totally in control throughout the album, which could be down to her having written almost all of the songs herself, or could be down to her new position in the world. Whatever the reason, it makes for quite an improvement over her previous album, No Promises, and fulfills the promise of her charming debut, Quelqu'un M'a Dit. It is probably the best album released by a [...] "First Lady", but beyond that, it's a pleasant, sometimes compelling album by a singer/songwriter with some stories to tell and a lovely way of telling them." [...] BBC said: [...] "Bruni's disc may not win her new fans in the stolidly un-French speaking UK. But removed from the context of her very public private life, this is a charming album." [...] The Telegraph said: [...] "The Premiere Dame may have a colourful past, but her music has always been as classically chic and subtly sexy as her Christian Dior wardrobe." [...] SFGate said: [...] "Even before she married French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Carla Bruni had <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> prominent men such as Mick Jagger and Donald Trump. So even though the lyrics on her third album, [...] "Comme Si de Rien N'Etait" [...] ("As If Nothing Happened"), were written before her latest romantic coup, it's hard to separate content from context, especially when, in the song [...] "Tu Es Ma Came", the singer describes her lover as [...] "more dangerous than Colombian white". But the mild-mannered music hardly matches the exuberance of lines like that. Slathered with strings, horns, and folk and blues guitars, Bruni's new album is not quite as charming as her 2003 premiere, [...] "Quelqu'un M'a Dit". Still, songs such as [...] "L'Amoureuse" [...] and [...] "Déranger Les Pierres" [...] are quite beautiful, and [...] "Salut Marin", a tribute to her late brother, might represent one of Bruni's finest recorded moments yet." ...|$|E
