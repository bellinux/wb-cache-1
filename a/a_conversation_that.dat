500|$|The light {{atmosphere}} of [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] is broken by what Riley terms [...] "the outwardly harnessed, but inwardly raging guitar" [...] that introduces Lennon's [...] "She Said She Said".

Harrison recalled that he helped Lennon finish the composition, which involved joining together three separate fragments of song. Having walked out of the session, McCartney did not contribute to the recording, leaving Harrison to perform the bass part in addition to lead guitar and harmony vocals. The lyric was inspired in part by <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>that</b> Lennon and Harrison had with actor Peter Fonda in Los Angeles in August 1965, while all three, along with Starr and members of the Byrds, were under the influence of LSD.

500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout.

[...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, you roll up a party of four average joes just like you did way back when in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party".

[...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>that</b> would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E

Dusty Welch, head of publishing at RedOctane, recognized Neversoft had a [...] "10-year track record of launching a game every single year and being in the top of the charts" [...] and felt that the development group [...] "brought a better and deeper sense of music sensibilities" [...] to the series. Despite the experience from the previous games, Alan Flores, head of development at Neversoft, commented that the game was [...] "deceptively simple" [...] and that it took much work for their 30-person team to recreate the gameplay for Guitar Hero III. Though they [...] "wanted to take the Guitar Hero experience to the next level" [...] by adding additional instruments in the same manner as Rock Band, they opted to focus on perfecting the guitar gameplay. In 2010, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick stated that they believed Neversoft would help them to develop great games for the series, but has since come to regret their failure to seek Harmonix for further development responsibility and believed this would have been a better move for both companies.|$|E
