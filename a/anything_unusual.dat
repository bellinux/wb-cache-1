5|$|At 14:50 CDT, Flight 191 {{pushed back}} from gate K5 and was cleared to taxi to runway 32R. Maintenance crews {{present at the}} gate did not notice <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> during push back, engine start, or taxi. Everything looked normal as the flight began its takeoff roll at 15:03.|$|E
5|$|The four hijackers {{checked in}} for the flight between 07:03 and 07:39Eastern Time. At 07:03, Ghamdi checked in without any luggage while Nami checked in two bags. At 07:24, Haznawi checked in one bag and at 07:39, Jarrah checked in without any luggage. Haznawi was the only hijacker {{selected}} for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). His checked bag underwent extra screening for explosives, with no extra scrutiny required by CAPPS at the passenger-security checkpoint. None of the security checkpoint personnel reported <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> about the hijackers.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Boston, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{investigate}} {{the disappearance of}} Dr. Craig Horning, an archaeologist from a local history museum, after a security guard discovers {{a large amount of}} blood in Horning's lab. They interview both the curator, Dr. Lewton, and graduate student Mona Wustner. They also visit a reclusive Bilac. After closing, Lewton is killed by the jaguar spirit after his car doesn't start. During an investigation of the crime scene, Scully comes across rat corpses in the engine compartment of Lewton's vehicle. Mona denies that <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> has happened in the museum.|$|E

5000|$|Polich later also {{published}} {{his analysis of}} Paulides' data in the Skeptical Inquirer. In the August 2017 article, An Investigation of the Missing 411 Conspiracy, Polich concluded: [...] "I've exhausted my exploration for <b>anything</b> genuinely <b>unusual.</b> After careful review, to me, not a single case stands out nor do the frequencies involved seem outside of expectations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll come in {{with the}} flood-tide no doubt, if the gale don't drive him in sooner, an' run ashore as near to the cave as possible; but he'll be scared away if he sees <b>anything</b> like <b>unusual</b> watchin' on the shore, so you'd better get out o' sight as fast as ye can, and keep there." ...|$|R
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct {{descendant}} of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E
5|$|When Kearns is {{reported}} missing ten weeks later and a witness {{claims to have}} seen foxfire near Dudley, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate. At {{the site of the}} alleged foxfire, the agents find the ground burnt and a witch's peg staked into the ground. Arens, the local sheriff, arrives and disclaims <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> occurring in Dudley. After visiting Kearns' wife, Doris, the agents discover {{that he was about to}} recommend a local chicken plant, Chaco Chicken, to be closed down for several health violations. While giving the agents a tour of the plant, floor manager Jess Harold claims that Kearns held a vendetta against Chaco Chicken. After hearing this, a hallucinatory Paula, who works at the plant, grabs and holds Harold at knife point. Mulder and Scully attempt to reason with Paula until she is shot and killed by Sheriff Arens. The plant's physician, Dr. Vance Randolph, later claims that Paula was suffering from consistent headaches, which Kearns had also reported.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify <b>anything</b> <b>unusual.</b> The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E
60|$|Only a {{few people}} in the {{immediate}} vicinity were conscious that <b>anything</b> at all <b>unusual</b> was happening. The promenade just at that particular spot was almost deserted.|$|R
50|$|When {{none of the}} above-described officially sanctioned {{signals are}} available, {{attention}} for assistance can be attracted by <b>anything</b> that appears <b>unusual</b> {{or out of the}} ordinary, such as a jib sail hoisted upside down.|$|R
5000|$|... "The fall of {{lumps of}} clay on a stranger's coffin doesn't sound any {{different}} from {{the fall of the}} same things on an ordinary wooden box- at least I didn't notice <b>anything</b> awesome or <b>unusual</b> in the sound." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{also said}} {{a number of}} small aeroplanes circled around it. However, a check later showed that no commercial, private or RAAF pilots had reported <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> in the area.|$|E
25|$|What {{matters is}} not whether there's <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> about the Earth; there's going to be {{something}} idiosyncratic about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.|$|E
25|$|After Casolaro's {{death was}} {{reported}} by several mainstream news organizations, police re-examined Room 517. The adjacent rooms to 517 had been rented the evening of Casolaro's death— one by Mike Looney, the other by an unnamed family. No one reported hearing <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> either {{on the night of}} August 9 or the morning of August 10.|$|E
60|$|Whenever Mrs Marrot said <b>anything</b> with <b>unusual</b> emphasis, baby Marrot {{entertained the}} {{unalterable}} conviction {{that he was}} being scolded; no sooner, therefore, did he observe the well-known look, and hear the familiar tones, than he opened wide his mouth and howled with injured feeling. At the same moment a train rushed past like an average earthquake, {{and in the midst of}} this the man of law rose, and saying that he would communicate with Mrs Marrot soon, took his leave.|$|R
5000|$|Bertha (voiced by Tara Charendoff) - Lydia's {{friend from}} school. She is tall, gangly, {{and has an}} overbite. Bertha loves to swoon over teen boys, read teen magazines, and eat chips. Like Lydia, she too shares a passion for <b>anything</b> strange and <b>unusual.</b> Beetlejuice refers to her as Burp.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the day of}} Titus’s birth, Sepulchrave {{is engaged}} in another round of empty ritual. However, after the birth, he meets with Doctor Prunesquallor in an upper {{corridor}} outside the room of his wife, Gertrude. During {{the course of the}} conversation, he displays some interest in the condition of his child and inquires whether the doctor “…notices <b>anything</b> strange, <b>unusual</b> about his (Titus’s) face.” The Doctor replies that “Professionally speaking. I should say the face was irregular.” Sepulchrave is distressed: “Tell me the truth; have you ever delivered a more hideous child?!” ...|$|R
25|$|Alex {{researches}} the Tenandrome flight but finds {{no indication}} of <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> besides a mechanical breakdown. He then attempts to visit Hugh Scott, but finds that Scott has been {{away from home for}} months. One of his neighbors notes that Scott’s personality has changed since the Tenandrome flight. Like Alex's uncle, Scott has become obsessed by the Resistance and Christopher Sim.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, Erickson had been under the {{influence}} of cocaine, Adderall, and alcohol. The following day, he had had no memory of what had transpired that Halloween night. At a later hearing, attorneys asked Erickson if he had noticed <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> the morning following the crime such as injuries or blood on his clothing. Erickson confirmed that there was nothing out of the ordinary.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2006, the Durham police {{made their}} {{investigation}} public when Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, the police supervisor, posted on a digital community bulletin board {{that they were}} investigating the rape {{of a young woman}} by three males at 610 North Buchanan, where she had attended a party in the late evening of March 13, and asking anyone in the area who saw or heard <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> to contact Investigator Benjamin Himan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Extremely so," [...] {{replied the}} donkey. [...] "Notice what vulgar {{expressions}} she uses. But I admire the owl {{for the reason}} that she is positively foolish. Owls are supposed to be so very wise, generally, that a foolish one is unusual, and you perhaps know that <b>anything</b> or anyone <b>unusual</b> is sure to be interesting to the wise." ...|$|R
50|$|Whatever {{the means}} of killing, the hunter has to be near the quarry {{in order to achieve}} it. Most animals are very {{sensitive}} to the presence of predators. In many cases, their sense of smell is highly developed, detecting <b>anything</b> with an <b>unusual</b> scent. The stalker therefore needs to approach from down-wind. Similarly, care needs to be taken to avoid being seen and heard.|$|R
50|$|Anabella (voiced by Katie Grant) {{is a dark}} pink flamingo, and the innocent, loving {{little sister}} of the group. Always happy and loving, she tends to {{daydream}} and can easily get distracted by <b>anything</b> beautiful or <b>unusual.</b> She is deeply sensitive, and she often expresses how she feels by dancing. Anabella has a free spirit, and is open and adventurous. Doki admires her and often accompanies her on all her adventures.|$|R
25|$|There {{were some}} {{questions}} about whether Sky had even been in the car that morning to begin with. Motorists who had passed the parked Acura did not report seeing <b>anything</b> <b>unusual,</b> not even a child in it. At Biryukova's apartment complex in Redmond, neighbors {{said she and her}} children rarely went out, and none of them had seen Sky for at least two weeks. Solomon was not aware of anyone having seen his son other than his ex-wife since an April doctor visit. However, Maile told the police that Sky had indeed been in the car that morning.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{excellent}} visibility, {{none of the}} RAF bombers {{had reported}} <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> that would indicate a new weapon or tactics in the German night fighter force. This ignorance was compounded by the tracerless ammunition used by the Bf 110s, as well as firing on the British bombers blind spots. Many RAF crews witnessed a sudden explosion of a friendly aircraft, but assumed, in some cases, it was very accurate flak. Few of the German fighters were seen, let alone fired on. Later on, as the specialist Bf 110G-4s were received by night fighter wings, the mid-cockpit mount was replaced by one at the extreme rear of the cabin.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Stanley Marcus {{introduced}} a new tradition of having extravagant and unusual gifts in each year's Christmas catalog, The Christmas Book; the idea was sparked when journalist Edward R. Murrow contacted Marcus to ask if the store would be offering <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> that might interest his radio listeners; Marcus invented on the spot an offering of a live Black Angus bull accompanied by a sterling silver barbecue cart, subsequently altering the catalog to include his new idea, priced at $1,925. At one point, the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog carried {{the distinction of being}} the item most stolen from recipients' mailboxes, prompting a Chicago postmaster to suggest the company switch to enclosing the catalogs in plain brown wrappers.|$|E
5000|$|The Lit à la Turque, a {{bed with}} two {{scrolling}} ends and a baldachin, {{was one of many}} products of the 18th century. [...] Due to the obsession with <b>anything</b> exotic or <b>unusual</b> from foreign countries; beds, furniture and other objects reflected this style. The design of this bed is not directly linked with any Turkish design, but reflects the luxurious and romantic designs that inspired the craftsmen of this time.|$|R
6000|$|... "We ain't {{come across}} <b>anything</b> that isn't <b>unusual</b> so far, sir. My men are all wearing extra {{leggings}} {{to keep them}} from being bitten by them adders--as long as my arm, some of 'em. And there's fungus there which, when you touch it, sends out a smell enough to make a man faint. We killed a cat the first day, as big and as fierce as a young tigress. It's a queer job, sir." ...|$|R
40|$|It is trite {{law that}} a lawyer owes their client a {{duty of care}} {{requiring}} the lawyer to take reasonable steps to avoid their client suffering foreseeable economiic loss: Hawkins v Clayton. In {{the context of a}} property transaction this will include a duty to warn the client of <b>anything</b> that is <b>unusual</b> or <b>anything</b> which may affect the client obtaining the full benefit of the contract entered into: Macindoe v Parbery...|$|R
25|$|Froon's camera {{contained}} {{photos from}} April 1 {{suggesting that the}} women had taken a trail at the overlook of the Continental Divide and wandered into some wilderness hours before their first attempt to reach 911, but with no signs of <b>anything</b> <b>unusual.</b> On April 8, ninety flash photos were taken between 01:00 am and 04:00 am, apparently deep in the jungle and in near-complete darkness. A few photos show that they were possibly near a river or a ravine. Some show a twig with plastic bags and candy wrappers {{on top of a}} rock, another shows what looks like toilet paper and a mirror on another rock, and another shows the back of Kremers's head with what looks like blood by her temple.|$|E
25|$|From the Hopkins Grammar School {{he went to}} Yale College, {{from which}} he was {{graduated}} with the class of 1861. There is scant information as to his four years at college. During that period he kept a diary from which he read extracts on the fifty-fifth reunion of his class, but this diary is not at present available. That the studious traits which he later manifested were not altogether lacking at this time may be inferred {{from the fact that}} he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Skull & Bones. Such records as we have do not indicate that there was <b>anything</b> <b>unusual</b> about this young student who had among his classroom contemporaries the poet Edward Rowland Sill, and two others who like himself were later to have much to do with the life of the university, his friends Tracy Peck and Franklin Bowditch Dexter.|$|E
500|$|Vernon Dursley is {{the husband}} of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of <b>anything</b> <b>unusual.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jasper had not {{expected}} <b>anything</b> so <b>unusual.</b> But after a short reflection he decided to show neither annoyance, nor even surprise. The river from which he had come had been politically disturbed {{for a couple of}} years, and he was aware that his visits there were looked upon with some suspicion. But he did not mind much the displeasure of the authorities, so terrifying to old Nelson. He prepared to leave the brig, and Schultz followed him to the rail as if to say something, but in the end stood by in silence. Jasper getting over the side, noticed his ghastly face. The eyes of the man who had found salvation in the brig from the effects of his peculiar psychology looked at him with a dumb, beseeching expression.|$|R
60|$|The {{longing to}} see her again, however, became too strong for him, and looking up a moment he was {{conscious}} of a blissful astonishment, for she was walking straight towards him with a smile in her eyes. She seemed to him almost ethereally dainty in the dust and turmoil of the big cargo shed, and for the moment he forgot his uncovered arms and neck, and felt every nerve in him thrill {{as he took the}} little gloved hand she held out. What she had done was not likely to be regarded as <b>anything</b> very <b>unusual</b> in that country, where most men are liable to startling vicissitudes of fortune and there are no very rigid social distinctions; but Ingleby failed to recognize this just then, and it was not astonishing that he should idealize her for her courage.|$|R
60|$|Dick pondered {{for a few}} moments. He {{had heard}} that Government {{officials}} were hard to move, and knew that, in hot countries, Englishmen who marry native wives sometimes grow apathetic and succumb to the climatic lethargy. But this was not all: he had to contend against the official dislike of <b>anything</b> informal and <b>unusual.</b> Had he been in the navy, his warning would have received attention, but as he was a humble civilian he had, so to speak, no business {{to know anything about}} such matters.|$|R
