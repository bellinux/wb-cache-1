5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move</b> for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Scania-Vabis {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} a then valuable supplier – Be-Ge Karosserifabrik, who were based in Oskarshamn. Be-Ge had been making truck cabs since 1946, and had been supplying cabs not only to Scania-Vabis, but also to their Swedish competitors Volvo. It was normal practice for truck manufacturers to outsource production of cabs to independent bodybuilders, so their acquisition by Scania-Vabis seemed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move.</b> Be-Ge owner Bror Göthe Persson had also established an additional cab factory at Meppel.|$|E

25|$|Willingham's {{third season}} {{started with a}} loss, but three {{straight}} wins brought the team back into national prominence. The team {{went on to win}} six games, but their fifth loss of the season, a blowout to the University of Southern California (USC) Trojans, was Willingham's final game at Notre Dame. Although the Irish were invited to a bowl game {{at the end of the}} season, Willingham was fired. The eventual hiring of Charlie Weis as Willingham's replacement was called <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move,</b> but Willingham's firing remained a controversial subject for years following his tenure.|$|E
25|$|Canada's Brian Mulroney {{not only}} ran {{on a similar}} {{platform}} but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in January 1989. Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move.</b> However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw {{as an attempt to}} assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of privatization and regulation to stimulate the economy.|$|E
25|$|After being {{released}} by Norwich he joined Gillingham, {{there was much}} speculation regarding his next career move. He received a number of offers but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham {{where he would be}} player/coach. It did not prove <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move</b> for Roberts and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly after Stan Ternent had succeeded Andy Hessenthaler as manager. In December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul Smith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman. In March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan {{until the end of the}} season, scoring his 200th league goal on his debut. Cambridge were relegated from League Two. In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with Gillingham to pay the final year of his contract.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Nguyễn Kim, {{a former}} {{official}} in the Lê court, revolted against the Mạc and helped king Lê Trang Tông restore the Lê court in the Thanh Hóa area. Thus a civil war began between the Northern Court (Mạc) and the Southern Court (Restored Lê). Nguyễn Kim's side controlled {{the southern part of}} Annam (from Thanhhoa to the south), leaving the north (including Đông Kinh-Hanoi) under Mạc control. When Nguyễn Kim was assassinated in 1545, military power fell into the hands of his son-in-law, Trịnh Kiểm. In 1558, Nguyễn Kim's son, Nguyễn Hoàng, suspecting that Trịnh Kiểm might kill him as he had done to his brother to secure power, asked to be governor of the far south provinces around present-day Quảng Bình to Bình Định. Hoang pretended to be insane, so Kiem was fooled into thinking that sending Hoang south was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move</b> as Hoang would be quickly killed in the lawless border regions. However, Hoang governed the south effectively while Trịnh Kiểm, and then his son Trịnh Tùng, carried on the war against the Mạc. Nguyễn Hoàng sent money and soldiers north to help the war but gradually he became more and more independent, transforming their realm's economic fortunes by turning it into an international trading post.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in {{exchange}} for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts {{felt that this was}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move,</b> because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128–78. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83–77. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55–27 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.|$|E

Additionally, Allison Bowsher from Much claimed that the artists, including Stefani and Timberlake, within the soundtrack created [...] "awesome music". Jonathan Hamard from Aficia compared the track to Stefani's 2004 song [...] "Rich Girl" [...] and the material on her third studio album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016). He felt her role in Trolls was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move</b> and claimed that Stefani's verses came off as cool and unpretentious. Similarly, Nadia N. from Virgin Radio saw the release as unexpected but praised the dancing qualities of the track.|$|E
500|$|The massive {{scale of}} the {{undertaking}} has also been commented upon, with both Hume, the customs commissioner, and M. E.

[...] The abolition {{of the line and}} equalisation of tax has generally been viewed as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>move,</b> with one writer of 1901 stating that it [...] "relieved the people and the trade along a broad belt of country, 2,000 miles long, from much harassment". Sir Richard Temple, governor of the Bengal and Bombay Presidencies, wrote in 1882 that [...] "the inland customs line for levying the salt-duties has been at length swept away" [...] and that care must be taken to ensure that the [...] "evils of the obsolete transit-duties" [...] did not return.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{possible}} approach for supply systems modeled using queueing networks. According to Poisson processes, unfinished goods and control impulses arrive at the working stations, namely the nodes of the network. When the working process in a node ends, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>moves</b> to another node with fixed probabilities either as a part to process or as a control impulse, or leaves the network. Each control impulse is activated during a random exponentially distributed time. According to some probabilities, activated impulses <b>move</b> <b>an</b> unfinished <b>good</b> from the node they arrive to another node, or destroy another unfinished part. For such a queueing network, a product form solution is found for the stationary state probabilities. The stability of the network, the stationary probabilities and {{the mean number of}} unfinished parts are studied via an algorithm. Such results are also useful to analyze a real system for assembling car parts...|$|R

25|$|Since the minimax {{algorithm}} and its variants are inherently depth-first, a strategy such as iterative deepening is usually {{used in conjunction}} with alpha–beta so that <b>a</b> reasonably <b>good</b> <b>move</b> can be returned even if the algorithm is interrupted before it has finished execution.
