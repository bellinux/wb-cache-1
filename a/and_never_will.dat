5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> {{you find them}} spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often {{seems to have a}} life of its own... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E

She commented that its concept was inspired by real events, and elaborated that [...] "people always ask me questions about certain things, and it's kind of like my response." [...] Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media interpreted Ferreira's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013, {{in which she was}} charged with possession of ecstasy. Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African American people in the music video, with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip. On her Facebook account, Ferreira commented that [...] "I never have <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> look at any human being as a prop" [...] and criticized false assumptions of the [...] "rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto".|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{has always}} been {{compared}} by the media to her sister, Beyoncé, whom she considers one of her role models. She has expressed her opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to [...] "God Given Name": [...] "I'm not her <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> be" [...] – which was purposely set as the album's opening track to show their differences. In his review for the album, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine referred to the lyrics as a declaration of independence. In {{an interview with the}} Daily Mail, Knowles commented: [...] "People think there should be this great rivalry between us, but there's never been any competition. There's a big age gap and we are two very different characters." [...] Beyoncé was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry, reasoning that it [...] "involves a lot of pressure". Knowles countered by saying, [...] "It's good to have her advice, but we really have different goals".|$|E
500|$|Coward's {{political}} views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised {{the government of}} Neville Chamberlain for its policy of appeasing Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the abdication crisis of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry [...] "his cutie", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, [...] "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." [...] Coward disliked propaganda in plays; [...] "The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> be is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." [...] Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and This Happy Breed are, {{in the words of}} the playwright David Edgar, [...] "overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner." [...] In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, [...] "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess." ...|$|E

[...] The Columbia Democrat also objected to the new draft laws. When Samuel F. Pealer, a draft officer, attempted to recruit four men in Stillwater, one of the men threatened to [...] "knock [...] brains out". Unrest increased still further after a costly military campaign in Virginia in early 1864. By June of that year, opposition to the draft was made clear when 75 percent of all people drafted in Columbia County failed to show up. Tension was especially high in the community of Mifflinville, where many people in the county accused one another of conspiracy. The accusations became exaggerated, leading to the rumors of a fort in the mountains at the headwaters of Fishing Creek. Some people even claimed to have seen the fort and the trails along which cannons were supposedly dragged.|$|E

[...] Without the exclusion legislation, Harlan stated his opinion that vast numbers of Chinese [...] "would have rooted out the American population" [...] in the western United States. Acknowledging the opposing view supporting citizenship for American-born Chinese, he said that [...] "Of course, the argument on the other side is that the very words of the constitution embrace such a case." [...] Commenting on the Wong Kim Ark case shortly after the issuance of the Court's ruling in 1898, San Francisco attorney Marshall B. Woodworth wrote that [...] "the error the dissent apparently falls into {{is that it does not}} recognize that the United States, as a sovereign power, has the right to adopt any rule of citizenship it may see fit, and that the rule of international law does not furnish [...] the sole and exclusive test of citizenship of the United States".|$|E
500|$|Johnny Loftus of Allmusic {{classified}} [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] as a nu metal song. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{concluded that}} the song [...] "take things to a more over-the-top, theatrical level." [...] Scott Juba of The Trades rated the song with A, and wrote: [...] "As far as the band's single, 'Everybody's Fool', is concerned, it is a song about the stinging betrayal of deception and the refusal to become blinded by deceit any longer. There is a defiance in Lee's voice that gives the track a bold edge, and the song's heavy drums and soaring guitars further enhance the strong sound. The band surely has another chart topping hit on their hands." [...] Simon Cusens of ABC Online gave the song 3 out of 5 stars calling it [...] "a cold, sad and angry song that I would only like to listen to without it being repeated again." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "rolling acoustic guitar and billowing synthesizers {{pave the way for}} the harsh power chords that open the song" [...] adding that Lee's voice was [...] "disembodied" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Perfect by nature/ Icons of self-indulgence/ Just what we all need/ More lies about a world that/ Never was <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> be." ...|$|E

500|$|Later in life, Lady Munster {{became a}} novelist and short story writer, writing {{under the title}} the Countess of Munster. At the age of nearly sixty, she {{published}} two novels; her first, Dorinda, in 1889, and her second, A Scotch Earl, in 1891. The plot of Dorinda centred on {{a young woman who}} eventually kills herself after stealing works of art from her friends. Oscar Wilde noted Munster's skill in writing Dorinda; he compared the [...] "exceedingly clever" [...] novel's eponymous heroine to [...] "a sort of well-born" [...] Becky Sharp, and praised the author's ability [...] "to draw... in a few sentences the most lifelike portraits of social types and social exceptions". In 1888, an article by Munster about ballad singing appeared in The Woman's World, a Victorian women's magazine edited by Wilde. A Scotch Earl, which centred on a vulgar Scottish nobleman named Lord Invergordon, was less well received by contemporaries. The Spectator published a critical review soon after its publication which suggested that the novel's showering of [...] "contempt upon the society of wealth and rank" [...] was close to Republicanism or Socialism. The review criticised A Scotch Earl for lacking [...] "any merits of construction or style", and added that Lady Munster was [...] "not <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> be a capable novelist".|$|E
500|$|... "The Constant" [...] is {{the second}} Lost episode to deal {{directly}} {{with the concept of}} time travel after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. [...] While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device [...] "in a way we never have before <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> again" [...] and while promoting [...] "The Constant", he said that it [...] "upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it." [...] Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. [...] The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes"—although, Lindelof has said that [...] "The Constant" [...] is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show—by Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. [...] Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. [...] The writers hoped that [...] "The Constant" [...] would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. [...] Lindelof reminisced that [...] "just breaking that episode was such a massive headache" [...] and Cuse added that [...] "it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week".|$|E
500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>will.</b> We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then we knew we were also accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, although I think it still less than 50% of our general fan base." ...|$|E
