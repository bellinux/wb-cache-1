40|$|In this dissertation, I {{will explore}} how 1990 s and 2000 s British, Irish and South Asian {{historical}} films represented the violent legacy of partition {{on the island}} of Ireland and in South Asia, respectively. I contend that a cross-regional and cross-national examination of the relationships between national memory, national cinema and minority will reveal that partition had a similar effect on Irish, South Asian and Northern Irish societies: the alignment of a normative national identity with a particular religious identity. This study will explore how key Irish, British and South Asian cinematic texts, despite being produced in disparate production contexts, similarly represent the brutal marginalization of gendered and religious minorities as a central legacy of partition. In my engagement with these films, I have two central areas of exploration. The first is how these films challenge state or majoritarian histories by presenting themselves as historical texts that correct the historical record. I will show how state histories (Michael Collins), majoritarian narratives (Hey!Ram), repressed gendered minority histories (Khamosh Pani, The Magdalene Sisters) and post-conflict narratives (Five Minutes of Heaven and Fiza) contest majoritarian or colonial histories. The second, and <b>ancillary,</b> <b>area</b> of exploration is how the international trauma film genre influences the films 2 ̆ 7 respective representations of atrocity. I argue that trauma theory can help us understand minorities 2 ̆ 7 relationship to the state and the ongoing impact of particular historical events on community and nation. To ground my comparative analysis, I draw from postcolonial theory, poststructuralism and trauma theory. In conclusion, I will contend that these films 2 ̆ 7 minority figures remind us of the dangers of nationalism 2 ̆ 7 s limited imaginative boundaries and the role that cinema plays in helping us to think beyond its limitations...|$|E

50|$|Building {{design was}} created in 1912 by Albert Schütze' Studio in Magdeburg for two {{identical}} projects, in Bydgoszcz and Poznan.

40|$|A plan is {{presented}} {{for the development}} of a high fidelity multidisciplinary optimization process for rotorcraft. The plan formulates individual disciplinary design problems, identifies practical high-fidelity tools and processes that can be incorporated in an automated optimization environment, and establishes statements of the multidisciplinary design problem including objectives, constraints, design variables, and cross-disciplinary dependencies. Five key disciplinary areas are selected in the development plan. These are rotor aerodynamics, rotor structures and dynamics, fuselage aerodynamics, fuselage structures, and propulsion / drive system. Flying qualities and noise are included as <b>ancillary</b> <b>areas.</b> Consistency across engineering disciplines is maintained with a central geometry engine that supports all multidisciplinary analysis. The multidisciplinary optimization process targets the preliminary design cycle where gross elements of the helicopter have been defined. These might include number of rotors and rotor configuration (tandem, coaxial, etc.). It is at this stage that sufficient configuration information is defined to perform high-fidelity analysis. At the same time there is enough design freedom to influence a design.

40|$|There is {{potential}} for pig veterinarians {{to broaden the}} range of services they provide into areas that might, initially, appear to be nonveterinary. In order to compete successfully for this market, the veterinarian must be educated {{in a wide range}} of <b>ancillary</b> <b>areas</b> and must demonstrate expertise for which the consumer is prepared to pay. Regulatory changes could create new opportunities for veterinary services. Opportunities exist for greater involvement in quality assurance schemes, animal welfare, disease control and eradication programs, biosecurity procedures, environmental programs, and enhancement of food safety. Food safety programs will require close ties among veterinarians, government agencies, producers, meat processors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, consumer associations, and transporters. Because the veterinary consultant will need to play an active role in developing programs designed to improve food safety and the consumer’s image of pork, food-safety-related veterinary services, laboratory services, consultancy, and quality assurance practices are likely to expand in the future. Consumer pressure could radically influence systems of intensive pig production in the future, particularly the confinement of sows, the use of totally slatted floors, and the use of farrowing crates for lactating sows. The pig veterinarian will play a key role in developing and advising about alternative systems of housing that both satisfy welfare requirements under commercial conditions and allow pork to be produced profitably. The demand for laboratory procedures is increasing.

40|$|William Temple (1881 - 1944) and Michael Ramsey (1904 - 1988) {{are two of}} {{the leading}} Anglican intellectuals of the twentieth century. Their {{significance}} does not just lie in the quality of their intellect. Each served as Archbishop of Canterbury during their career; that essentially representative role heightens the sense of the significance of their work to an understanding of Anglican thought during the period. Yet surprisingly little has been written on Temple and Ramsey’s theology, and there have been no attempts to give a detailed, systematic account of their thought. Such a comprehensive study lies {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis. Yet the research does seek to contribute to an understanding of Temple and Ramsey’s thought. The thesis has its origins in an incidental remark made by Professor David Brown, who commented that Anglican theologians of the twentieth century had tended to downplay the role of substitutionary atonement in their theological schema. This raised a fundamental question: what impact might such a downplaying have at the wider level of systematic theology? How might it mould their account of the Incarnation, and how might that, in turn, shape their wider thought? This thesis does not set out to test Brown’s claim for a downplaying of substitutionary atonement, but it does – incidentally – show that Temple and Ramsey are examples of the trend. Rather, the focus is on Temple and Ramsey’s rationale for the Incarnation, and the place of substitutionary atonement within it. As such, it addresses a significant gap in understanding of their thought. Its central claim is that Temple and Ramsey understood the Incarnation not, primarily as a response to sin, but as a sacrificial means of deepening the union between God and humanity. At the core of their rationale for the Incarnation, it is argued, is the eternal divine purposive desire for fellowship, and not the exigent necessity of substitutionary atonement. There are two <b>ancillary</b> <b>areas</b> of study. First, the question of the compatibility of their respective accounts of the Incarnation. Arguing for a high level of coherence within and between their accounts, the thesis suggests that such compatibility underlines the significance of their Christology for an understanding of wider Anglican thought during the period. Secondly, the thesis tentatively highlights ways in which each man’s rationale for the Incarnation impacts on their wider thought, not least their ecclesiology...|$|R
50|$|Construction {{and changes}} in {{services}} continued through the 1980s and 1990s. Home Hospital continued to experience patient growth. The result: {{the addition of the}} new front lobby, patient rooms and <b>ancillary</b> service <b>areas,</b> parking garage and other areas. In 1984, a corporate restructuring created a family of corporations united by a single goal: doing whatever was necessary to maintain Home Hospital as a vibrant, community-owned hospital. North Central Health Services (NCHS) became the new name and parent company of Home Hospital and several other ventures. In 1990, in preparing for its 100th anniversary as Home Hospital, it launched a massive remodeling and modernization project. On Sept. 26, 1997, Home Hospital and St. Elizabeth officials announced that the two entities intended to combine the governance and management in a new corporation. The unified hospital system - originally called Greater Lafayette Health Services GLHS - would work to be more efficient and more responsive to those who purchase and consume health care. Some of the benefits of creating the new system would be to eliminate waste and reduce the duplication of expensive technology. They officially merged on Jan. 1, 1999.|$|R
