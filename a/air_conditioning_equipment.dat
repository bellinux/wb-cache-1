25|$|The Spirit of Progress {{ushered in}} a {{standard}} of passenger train speed and comfort not previously seen in Australia. Its introduction in November 1937 marked the culmination of many years of preparatory work by the Victorian Railways, from the laying of heavier rail on the North East line, introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange apparatus to allow continuous high speed running between track sections, introduction of high-powered three-cylinder Pacific locomotives, and the testing of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>equipment</b> on passenger rolling stock. Such was the commitment of VR Chief Commissioner Harold Clapp to introducing a world-class train service to Victorian Railways, virtually no detail was overlooked. VR engineers famously road-tested the new train's smoothness on curves by studying a full bowl of soup in the dining car as the train took curves at full speed; if the soup splashed {{over the side of}} the bowl a decision would be taken whether to modify the curve for higher speeds or reduce the speed limit for the curve. Harold Clapp could not, however, take credit for the name for the service; when discussing with his wife his proposed Royal Victorian name (inspired by the LMS Royal Scot), Mrs Clapp suggested, on the spur of the moment, Spirit of Progress.|$|E

Nowadays an increasing consciousness of the importance of part load working influence on the equipment long term efficiency has stimulated the investigation about part load working behaviour of the machine. Owing to the incredible lack of experimental data about this topic, suitable new tests in laboratory and field monitoring, expressly carried on, have shown the necessity of new algorithms.
