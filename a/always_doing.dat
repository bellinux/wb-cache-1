25|$|Chazal have {{in certain}} {{instances}} permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation {{in tandem with}} one's wife. Tosefot cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak (Isaac ben Samuel) who permits an occasional complete extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife on condition that one does not accustom himself to <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> so (Tosfoth, Yebamoth 34b, Tosfoth Sanhedrin 58b)). The Bayit Chadash (Yoel Sirkis) commentary to the Rabbeinu Asher (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the tosafist opinion. This opinion is likewise quoted in Tur Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer ch. 25.|$|E
25|$|Finding himself {{seated on}} a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed {{to sit next to}} the handsomest man in the room, Agathon, and that he is <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> such things (213c). Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Alcibiades says he will never do such a thing (213e). Wondering why {{everyone}} seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night's agreement (213e, c); after saying his drunken ramblings should not be placed next to the sober orations of the rest, and that he hopes no one believed a word Socrates said, Alcibiades proposes to offer an encomium to Socrates (214c-e).|$|E
25|$|Bob Clendenin as Tom Gazelian – Jules' widowed {{neighbor}} who expresses his attraction {{for her in}} weird ways, makes wine in his garage, and is <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> things for Jules and the gang without getting anything back {{in an attempt to}} become part of their group. He is frequently found to be peering into Jules' kitchen window, unnoticed by Jules and/or the gang until he says something. By season 4 he {{is considered one of the}} gang, appearing in most episodes and accompanying the group wherever they go, although still generally standing outside Jules' window instead of in the kitchen with the others. His behaviour is often weird and creepy, and details of his otherwise normal and successful life (that he is a millionaire neurosurgeon, former all-state track star, with an adult son in the Marines and a daughter attending law school) are slowly revealed as the series progresses.|$|E

500|$|Loup {{was born}} December 19, 1987, in Raceland, Louisiana. His father and {{grandfather}} influenced his baseball interest the most when he was young, {{and he says that}} it was [...] "just all baseball all the time", with [...] "a little football". Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that way. I was <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. I wanted to play baseball and knew that I needed to work hard to get there. As a kid, I needed to be reminded of that sometimes." [...] His baseball role models growing up were Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, L.A.P.D. {{recorded}} {{their second}} album, Who's Laughing Now. Released on May 3, 1991, {{it was their}} first full-length studio album, and consisted of eleven tracks. After they recorded the album, the group's lead vocalist, Pete Capra, left L.A.P.D. {{and was replaced by}} someone affectionately known by other band members as Corey. Bassist Arvizu wrote: [...] "Pete [...] was <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> amphetamines and stuff. He pretty much left just because of his drug abuse. So Munky , David , and I had to start all over again." [...] The band later fired Corey after his behavior during an audition with producer Ross Robinson. While looking for a new singer, they heard Jonathan Davis singing for the alternative metal band Sexart. After the show, the remaining band members of L.A.P.D. asked him to join their band. Shortly after this, the band changed their name to Korn and added Brian Welch to the member line-up.|$|E
500|$|They {{eventually}} {{married on}} June 21, 1940 at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California. She {{said that she}} had been attracted to the young Nixon because he [...] "was going places, he was vital and ambitious... he was <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> things". Later, referring to Richard Nixon, she said, [...] "Oh but you just don't realize how much fun he is! He's just so much fun!" [...] Following a brief honeymoon in Mexico, the two lived in a small apartment in Whittier. [...] As U.S. involvement in World War II began, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., with Richard taking a position as a lawyer for the Office of Price Administration (OPA); Pat worked as a secretary for the American Red Cross, but also qualified as a price analyst for the OPA. [...] He then joined the United States Navy, and while he was stationed in San Francisco, she resumed work for the OPA as an economic analyst.|$|E

500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] {{received}} negative reviews from critics. Aaron Peck of High-Def Digest criticized the episode for being unoriginal, writing [...] "Homer is <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> something that jeopardizes {{his marriage to}} Marge. When Homer's 'Vegas Wife' shows up unexpectedly [...] the same thing happens. This is a storyline that has worn out its welcome, but it still continues." [...] 411Mania's Ron Martin described the episode as having a [...] "ridiculous set up". Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well, calling it [...] "Mannered {{to the point of}} ridiculousness." [...] While he didn't consider it the worst episode he's ever seen, he criticized the episode's pacing and lack of satire, writing [...] "it’s just that the plates spin so fast and so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags. [...] the satire is gone; it’s just incident after incident to set up gags (some of which are funny) and get the show to an end time." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger {{people who are just}} starting their bands who happen to live in the canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitney {{was portrayed}} by Brook Kerr from the series' debut on July 5, 1999, to September 7, 2007. In 2005, Sidne Siobhan Phillips portrayed the {{character}} in flashbacks. Passions casting director Jacklynn Briskey originally rejected 26-year-old Brook Kerr {{for the role}} of Whitney, believing she would look too mature to play a teenager. Despite this decision, Kerr's husband Christopher Warren submitted his wife's head shots to the network and she was hired to play the character. Kerr later described the week of auditioning and two screen tests to be formally cast in the role as an extremely quick process. While discussing her portrayal of the character, Kerr said, [...] "I was always the sensible one, the friend everyone could count on, <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> what I should." [...] Over the course of the series, media outlets frequently speculated on the exact nature of Whitney's relationship with Chad. The incest storyline led media outlets to sensationalize Harmony as the place where [...] "half-siblings sleep with one another." [...] Soap Opera Digest listed the 2006 revelation that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood as one of Passions most shocking secrets.|$|E

500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> something, and had {{something else to do}} afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The Funny Little Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E
500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training. DeLonge, the song's {{primarily}} lyricist, explains {{the song in}} a 2000 tour booklet: [...] "Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than." [...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint about girls not <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> exactly what you wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. While watching the movie Can't Hardly Wait, Hoppus {{began to think about}} [...] "how much it sucks when people are in love in high school" [...] and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities. Since it was recorded late in production, the band {{had to go back to}} Los Angeles to record Barker's drum track.|$|E

While in New York, she took classes at the School of American Ballet, but on tour there were no official classes. [...] Instead, Tallchief studied the efforts of her more experienced colleagues. In particular, she admired Alexandra Danilova who was known for her work ethic and professionalism. Tallchief practiced whenever she could, earning a reputation as a hard worker.

[...] "My mother was <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil and paid 10 pounds a week. But she was very funny, and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour." [...] On a separate occasion, on the subject of her mother's jobs, Ullman recalled: [...] " [...] worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption." [...] Despite reality, their mother maintained that they were middle-class.
