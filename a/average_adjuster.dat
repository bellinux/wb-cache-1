40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine if products advertised as environmentally friendly dishwashing detergents were safer for the environment than conventional detergents.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{elucidate}} the main differences between certain types of professional appraisers of risks and losses in the insurance market infrastructure of Ukraine.

Taking into account that professional appraisers of risks and losses as well as actuaries are responsible for the appraisals and recommendations provided by them, it is advisable to insure their professional responsibility.
