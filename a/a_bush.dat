5|$|Bushshrikes {{are similar}} in habits to shrikes, hunting insects and other small prey from a perch on <b>a</b> <b>bush.</b> Although similar in build to the shrikes, these tend to be either {{colourful}} species or largely black; some species are quite secretive.|$|E
5|$|News of {{his death}} spread in Kenema and its environs like <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> fire in the harmattan. Most people were devastated {{to learn that the}} only Lassa Fever {{specialist}} in Sierra Leone was gone, gone forever. Nurses cried, patients wept. Kenema was thrown into a state of shock and mourning.|$|E
50|$|A Grizzly caliber {{conversion}} kit typically included a barrel, a magazine, an ejector, an extractor, <b>a</b> barrel <b>bushing,</b> and <b>a</b> recoil spring. Some also included <b>a</b> <b>bushing</b> type recoil compensator and a wrench {{for use with}} the compensator.|$|R
50|$|For {{light-duty}} applications <b>a</b> <b>bushing</b> type follower can be used. Instead {{of using}} a type of a roller <b>a</b> plastic <b>bushing</b> is used to reduce friction, which provides a maintenance free follower. The disadvantage {{is that it can}} only support light loads, slow speeds, no thrust loads, and the temperature limit is 200 F. <b>A</b> <b>bushing</b> type stud follower can only support approximately 25% of the load of a roller type stud follower, while the heavy and yoke followers can handle 50%. Also all-metallic heavy-duty bushing type followers exist.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>bushing</b> or rubber <b>bushing</b> is <b>a</b> type of {{vibration}} isolator. It {{provides an}} interface between two parts, damping the energy transmitted through the <b>bushing.</b> <b>A</b> common application is in vehicle suspension systems, where <b>a</b> <b>bushing</b> made of rubber (or, more often, synthetic rubber or polyurethane) separates {{the faces of}} two metal objects while allowing {{a certain amount of}} movement. This movement allows the suspension parts to move freely, for example, when traveling over a large bump, while minimizing transmission of noise and small vibrations through to the chassis of the vehicle. <b>A</b> rubber <b>bushing</b> may also be described as a flexible mounting or antivibration mounting.|$|R
5|$|The {{call of the}} Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} bush {{remedies}} {{used to treat}} jack jumper stings (and any other Myrmecia sting). The young tips of a bracken fern provide a useful bush remedy to treat jack jumper stings, discovered and currently used by indigenous Australians. The tips are rubbed on the stung area, and may relieve the local pain after getting stung. Another plant used as <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> remedy is Carpobrotus glaucescens (known as angular sea-fig or pigface).|$|E
5|$|An {{earlier version}} of the film that was edited before it was {{publicly}} screened had included a painting class on the lunar base that included Kubrick's daughters, additional scenes {{of life on the}} base, and Floyd buying <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> baby from a department store via videophone for his daughter. A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with actual scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life, was removed after an early screening for MGM executives. The text survives in the book The Making of Kubrick's 2001 by Jerome Agel.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> drill <b>bushing,</b> {{also known}} as <b>a</b> jig <b>bushing,</b> is <b>a</b> tool used in {{metalworking}} jigs to guide cutting tools, most commonly drill bits. Other tools that are commonly used in <b>a</b> drill <b>bushing</b> include counterbores, countersinks, and reamers. They are designed to guide, position, and support the cutting tool.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>a</b> <b>bushing,</b> {{as compared to}} a solid connection, is less noise and vibration are transmitted. Another advantage is that they require little to no lubrication.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>A</b> <b>bushing</b> is very {{important}} because it must supply the high voltage to the power equipment. Generally, the surface of bushing is contaminated with rain, dust, salt and others. <b>A</b> <b>bushing</b> with contaminations at air are serious problem in insulation. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the inspection and diagnoses of the safety. The ultra-violet rays(UV) camera has attracted interest from the view point of easy judgement. In this paper, we will report on the corona discharge characteristics on bushing model with contaminations. Also, UV images of discharge in air are analyzed using prototype UV camera of Korea...|$|R
5|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} rollerblading in Central Park stumble across {{the body of a}} woman with several lacerations hidden in <b>a</b> <b>bush.</b> Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb {{around the time of the}} murder. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E

50|$|In {{electric}} power, <b>a</b> <b>bushing</b> is <b>an</b> insulated {{device that}} allows an electrical conductor to pass safely through a grounded conducting barrier {{such as the}} case of a transformer or circuit breaker.Bushing is made up of Porcelain material.|$|R
50|$|For <b>a</b> <b>bushing</b> to work {{successfully}} {{over many}} years, the insulation must remain effective both in composition and design shape {{and will be}} key factors in its survival. Bushings can therefore vary considerably in both material and design style.|$|R
5|$|Cape sparrows {{primarily}} eat seeds, {{and also}} eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks {{to move around}} in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, <b>a</b> <b>bush,</b> a cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, {{and it is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} sparrows include house cats and small raptors like Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks, American kestrels, and white-tailed kites. The nests may be raided by {{a range of}} species {{including}} mammals and reptiles such as snakes, though nest predation {{has not yet been}} directly observed, and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators; the rodent run, the broken wing, and the tumbling off the bush. Birds adopt a rodent run display to distract predators. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out, and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. In the broken wing display, the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging, leading the predator away until the bird ceases the act and escapes the predator. The adult rufous-crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> to attract the predator to itself in the tumbling off the bush display.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of <b>a</b> <b>bush.</b> It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E
50|$|In plain bearings, {{the shaft}} is usually {{in contact with}} <b>a</b> <b>bushing</b> (sleeve or flanged) to reduce friction. When the {{rotation}} is slow and the load is radial, the model of uniform pressure can be used (small deformations and clearance).|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> double-tapped <b>bushing</b> is <b>a</b> fitting {{which serves}} as a reducer. It is a sleeve similar to a close nipple, but is {{threaded}} on both its inner and outer circumferences. Like a reducer, <b>a</b> double-tapped <b>bushing</b> has two threads of different sizes.|$|R
50|$|In the US, {{the album}} was {{initially}} unreleased following the failure of her debut. <b>As</b> <b>Bush</b> gained <b>a</b> cult following over the coming years however, Lionheart was belatedly released in 1984 following the entry into the charts of her fourth album The Dreaming.|$|R
5|$|The Trojans next {{traveled}} to Eugene, Oregon {{to face the}} Ducks in both teams' conference opener. The Ducks, led by eleventh–year head coach Mike Bellotti and quarterback Kellen Clemens, came into the game undefeated, and started quickly with an early field goal. Later in the quarter, Clemens threw a touchdown and {{early in the second}} quarter another field goal gave the Ducks a 13–0 lead. Before the end of the half, Leinart threw a touchdown to Bush and a Mario Danelo field goal gave the Trojans a 13–10 deficit at the half. In the second half, the Trojans began an onslaught with two more Leinart touchdown passes, two LenDale White touchdown rushes, and <b>a</b> <b>Bush</b> rush for a touchdown. Scoring 45straight points, the Trojans won the game 45–13 and extended their winning streak to 25games and improved to 3–0 on the season as the Ducks fell to 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and dry grass in <b>a</b> <b>bush,</b> tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are typically 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning <b>a</b> <b>Bush</b> administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a busbar, the {{conductor}} terminals will support the busbar in its location. In {{the case of}} <b>a</b> <b>bushing,</b> <b>a</b> fixing device will also be attached to the insulation to hold it in its location. Usually, the fixing point is integral or surrounds the insulation over part of the insulated surface. The insulated material between the fixing point and the conductor is the most highly stressed area.|$|R

5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through <b>a</b> <b>bush.</b> The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind <b>a</b> <b>bush</b> or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E
