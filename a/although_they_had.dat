5|$|A {{group of}} Assassins murdered Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, in 1213. After Bohemond and the Templars laid siege their {{fortress}} at Khawabi, the Assassins sought assistance from Bohemond's old ally, Az-Zahir Ghazi. Az-Zahir Ghazi appealed to Al-Adil, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been enemies. Their alliance forced Bohemond {{to lift the}} siege and to send an apology to Az-Zahir Ghazi.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{considered}} not contesting {{the election}} because {{the area was}} a Conservative stronghold, the Liberals decided {{to do so in}} order to generate a discussion on the issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Allsopp was in agreement with the Conservative policy, which was to maintain full governmental control over Ireland, and pass further Coercion Acts to reduce lawlessness in that country. Sanders, who had lost two previous elections for the Liberal Party, was in favour of devolution of powers to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{initially}} {{been told}} {{that they would be}} withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E

The nation's best performance came in their first World Cup where they finished third. In their following two World Cup campaigns they were eliminated after finishing third in their groups.|$|E

5|$|It {{was decided}} at a Football Association Council meeting on 26 September 1966 {{to host the}} League Cup at Wembley Stadium for the first time. The final had {{previously}} been decided over two legs, but the move to Wembley coincided with a change in format to a single leg final. Albion were the defending champions and were aiming {{to become the first}} team to retain the Cup. The winner of the League Cup typically went on to play in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Albion were still in the competition {{at the time of the}} final, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> recently lost 3–0 to Bologna in the first leg of the third round.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 01:00 on 15 December, the New Zealand Division—electing {{not to make}} {{a further}} frontal assault on Orsogna—launched their 5th Brigade in Operation Florence, a new {{flanking}} attack {{to the right of the}} village. By that afternoon, 5th Brigade was well established on the Orsogna to Ortona lateral road and had driven a shallow salient into the German forward defensive line. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> exhausted nearly all their reserves, divisional headquarters was optimistic for the prospects for the next day, given the heavy casualties they had inflicted that day.|$|E
5|$|Mismanagement {{over the}} next few years led to Hibs {{becoming}} homeless and the club temporarily ceased operating in 1891. A lease on the Easter Road site was acquired in late 1892 and Hibs played its first match at Easter Road on 4 February 1893. Despite this interruption, the club today views the period since 1875 as one continued history and therefore counts the honours won between 1875 and 1891, including the 1887 Scottish Cup. The club were admitted to the Scottish Football League in 1893, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to win the Second Division twice before being elected into the First Division in 1895.|$|E

5|$|On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention {{declared}} war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, but these were countered by French victories at Tourcouring (1794), Dunkirk, and Haguenau. For the French, the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved especially disastrous, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, War of the Pyrenees (1793–1795).|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One of the key elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional threat against Norway via wireless traffic and visual deception. Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a key objective for the Allies (<b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> earlier considered and rejected the option).|$|E
