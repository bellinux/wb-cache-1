5000|$|<b>Aerobic</b> {{exercise}} comprises innumerable forms. In general, it {{is performed}} {{at a moderate}} level of intensity over a relatively long period of time. For example, running a long distance at a moderate pace is an <b>aerobic</b> exercise, but sprinting is not. Playing singles tennis, with near-continuous motion, is generally considered <b>aerobic</b> activity, while golf or two person team tennis, with brief bursts of activity punctuated by more frequent breaks, may not be predominantly <b>aerobic.</b> Some sports are thus inherently [...] "aerobic", while other <b>aerobic</b> exercises, such as fartlek training or <b>aerobic</b> dance classes, are designed specifically to improve <b>aerobic</b> capacity and fitness. It is most common for <b>aerobic</b> exercises to involve the leg muscles, primarily or exclusively. There are some exceptions. For example, rowing to distances of 2,000 m or more is an <b>aerobic</b> sport that exercises several major muscle groups, {{including those of the}} legs, abdominals, chest, and arms.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a simple technique to measure maximum <b>aerobic</b> capacity and relate this value to the person's state of training. Twenty trained and twenty untrained subjects ranging in age from 18 to 42 years participated in the study.

Maximum <b>aerobic</b> power values correlated significantly with maximum <b>aerobic</b> capacity values, and maximum <b>aerobic</b> power and the participant's age had a significantly greater correlation than maximum <b>aerobic</b> capacity and the participant's age. There was no evidence that the maximum <b>aerobic</b> capacity test was any less efficient than the maximum <b>aerobic</b> power test for separating out levels of training, but the former was much easier to administer. Since maximum <b>aerobic</b> capacity was less related to age than maximum <b>aerobic</b> power it might be a better test for evaluating a person's state of training...|$|R

40|$|Regular {{exercise}} {{training is}} recognized as a powerful tool to improve work capacity, endothelial function and the cardiovascular risk profile in obesity, but it is unknown which of high-intensity <b>aerobic</b> exercise, moderate-intensity <b>aerobic</b> exercise or strength training is the optimal mode of exercise. In the present study, a total of 40 subjects were randomized to high-intensity interval <b>aerobic</b> training, continuous moderate-intensity <b>aerobic</b> training or maximal strength training programmes for 12 -áweeks, three times/week. The high-intensity group performed <b>aerobic</b> interval walking/running at 85 GÇô 95 % of maximal heart rate, whereas the moderate-intensity group exercised continuously at 60 GÇô 70 % of maximal heart rate; protocols were isocaloric. The strength training group performed GÇÿhigh-intensityGÇÖ leg press, abdominal and back strength training. Maximal oxygen uptake and endothelial function improved in all groups; the greatest improvement was observed after high-intensity training, and an equal improvement was observed after moderate-intensity <b>aerobic</b> training and strength training. High-intensity <b>aerobic</b> training and strength training were associated with increased PGC- 1 +¦ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor +¦ co-activator 1 +¦) levels and improved Ca 2 + transport in the skeletal muscle, whereas only strength training improved antioxidant status.

40|$|SummaryPurposeAerobic {{exercise}} {{training is}} a recognized approach for improving functional capacity in COPD. People with greater disease severity often have difficulty achieving higher <b>aerobic</b> exercise training intensity. The effects of resistance training prior to <b>aerobic</b> training were examined {{to determine if}} this sequential approach was associated with greater gains in functional status than <b>aerobic</b> training alone or concurrent <b>aerobic</b> and resistance training. MethodsPatients were randomized to: 1) sequential resistance then <b>aerobic</b> training (RT-then-AT) (8 weeks resistance training followed by 8 weeks <b>aerobic</b> exercise training), 2) control group (CE-then-AT + RT) (8 weeks of ‘sham’ training followed by 8 weeks concurrent <b>aerobic</b> and resistance training), 3) control group (CE-then-AT) (8 weeks ‘sham’ training followed by 8 weeks <b>aerobic</b> training). Outcomes were assessed at study entry, after week 8, and after week 16 : <b>aerobic</b> exercise performance; muscle strength and endurance. Results 75 patients completed training: FEV 1 %pred 40  ±  10, V˙ O 2 peak %predicted, 71  ±  22, fat-free mass index 19. 5  ±  3. 1. RT-then-AT had greater acquisition of peripheral muscle endurance than CE-then-AT + RT and CE-then-AT, but improvements in <b>aerobic</b> exercise performance were similar. Improvements in muscle strength were similar between RT-then-AT and CE-then-AT + RT. Sarcopenia was associated with poorer attendance, and lower <b>aerobic</b> and resistance training volumes. ConclusionAlthough the sequential approach to resistance and <b>aerobic</b> training yielded a greater increase in muscle endurance and higher resistance training volume compared to concurrent resistance and <b>aerobic</b> training, other training outcomes were similar between the two groups, thus the sequential approach is not clearly superior to the concurrent approach in severe COPD.

To compensate, she began participating in <b>aerobics</b> and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's Workout, inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's Workout Book. Jane Fonda's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series.

5|$|Human Entertainment's Dance <b>Aerobics</b> was {{an early}} rhythm-based video game {{released}} in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo's Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and {{as one of the}} first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed the core of future rhythm games. The success of PaRappa the Rapper sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game Beatmania in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a rubber pad that emulates a vinyl record. Beatmania was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami's Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include GuitarFreaks, which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998's Pop'n Music, a game similar to Beatmania in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the GuitarFreaks franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red Octane and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero. In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad because of the cost of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title DrumMania featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game Rock Band.|$|E
