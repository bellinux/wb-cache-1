6000|$|As to Moral Regeneration, {{that was}} mainly ensured by the Act for the Absolute Suppression of the Tea Trade. No man, said the Chancellor, {{had a right}} to endanger the health and {{happiness}} of his posterity by the pernicious habit of tea-drinking. Alcohol they had suppressed, and tobacco they had suppressed; but tea still remained a plague-spot in their midst. It had been proved that tea and coffee contained poisonous alkaloid principles, known as theine and caffeine (here the Chancellor displayed the full extent of his chemical learning), which were all but absolutely identical with the poisonous principles of opium, prussic acid, and atheistical literature generally. It might be said that this Bill endangered the liberty of the subject. No man had a greater respect for the liberty of the subject than he had; he adored, he idolized, he honoured with absolute apotheosis the liberty of the subject; but in what did it consist? Not, assuredly, in the right to imbibe a venomous drug, which polluted the stream of life for future generations, and was more productive of manifold diseases than even vaccination itself. [...] "Tea," [...] cried the orator passionately, raising his voice till the fresh whitewash on the ceiling of the Council Chamber trembled with sympathetic emotion; [...] "Tea, forsooth! Call it rather strychnine! Call it arsenic! Call it the deadly Upas-tree of Java (<b>Antiaris</b> toxicaria, Linnæus)"--what prodigious learning!--"which poisons with its fatal breath whoever ventures to pass beneath its baleful shadow! I see it driving out of the field the harmless chocolate of our forefathers; I see it forcing its way into the earliest meal of morning, and the latest meal of eve. I see it now once more swarming over the Pyrenees from France, with Paris fashions and bad romances, to desecrate the sacred hour of five o'clock with its newfangled presence. The infant in arms finds it rendered palatable to his tender years by the insidious addition of copious milk and sugar; the hallowed reverence of age forgets itself in disgraceful excesses at the refreshment-room of railway stations. This is the ubiquitous pest which distils its venom into every sex and every age! This is the enchanted chalice of the Cathaian Circe which I ask you to repel to-day from the lips of the young, the pure, and the virtuous!" ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Antiaris</b> toxicaria is a plant {{traditionally}} used in Ghana for {{the treatment}} of various neurological conditions such as epilepsy and pain. This present study therefore seeks to screen for the neuropharmacological activities of the aqueous extract of <b>Antiaris</b> toxicaria (AAE) stem bark. The effect of <b>Antiaris</b> extract on pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, tail immersion test, spontaneous locomotor activity, motor coordination, PTZ-induced convulsions as well as the Irwin test was investigated. The extract produced analgesia and Straub tail at (300 - 3000 mg kg− 1) in the Irwin test suggestive of a morphine-like action. These effects were absent after 24 h. No deaths were recorded in the test estimating the LD 50 to be above 3000 mg kg− 1. Spontaneous locomotor activity of the mice in the activity meter test was decreased significantly (p< 0. 01, F 4, 20 = 26. 61) by the extract at 100 mg kg− 1 but increased at 300 - 3000 mg kg− 1. It however showed no impairment on motor coordination in the beam traversal test. The extract potentiated duration of sleeping time in the pentobarbitone interaction test and showed susceptibility to metabolism by hepatic enzymes.
