From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 <b>African</b> states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became {{one of the founders of}} the <b>African</b> Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he called for <b>African</b> states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South <b>African</b> President Thabo Mbeki.|$|E

2500|$|A ship to {{transport}} the <b>Africans</b> to Liberia was engaged in June, 1829, and Waters Smith was ordered to prepare the <b>Africans</b> for embarkation. There were delays when the ship had to be replaced, and the departure point for the <b>Africans</b> was moved from St. Augustine to Fernandina, Florida. Smith had problems gathering the <b>Africans.</b> He had rented 36 of the <b>Africans</b> to Zephaniah Kingsley and another 20 to Joseph Marion Hernández. When Smith called for the hired-out <b>Africans</b> {{to be returned to}} him so that they could be shipped to Africa, Kingsley and Hernandez refused to do so, based on an opinion by the Collector of Customs for St. Augustine that the <b>Africans</b> were free men and therefore Smith had no authority to hire them out as slaves or to remove them from the possession of Kingsley and Hernandez and order them sent to Africa. Smith was able to bring the <b>Africans</b> into Fernandina, [...] "artly by force and partly by persuasion". Hernández never paid any of the money he owed Smith for the 20 <b>Africans</b> he had rented. Smith also paid Seminoles to bring in some of the <b>Africans</b> that had run away from Kingsley's and Hernández' plantations. Smith felt that he had to stay on guard in Fernandina because he suspected that slave dealers were planning to steal some of the <b>Africans</b> to carry them away for sale as slaves.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of McKinley's {{election}} in 1896, <b>African</b> Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality. McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor, and most <b>African</b> Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending sectionalism, and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of <b>African</b> Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. Blanche K. Bruce, an <b>African</b> American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an <b>African</b> American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta, Georgia, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in Presidio, Texas. However, <b>African</b> Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.|$|E
