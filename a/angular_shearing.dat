Weather radar interferometry is formulated for such measurements using phased-array weather-radar.

Auto- and cross-correlation functions are derived based on wave scattering by randomly distributed particles. Antenna separation, mean wind, shear, and turbulence all contribute to signal de-correlation. Crossbeam wind cannot be separated from shear and thus crossbeam wind measurements are biased by shear.

Numerical instabilities are smoothed by spectral filtering. Three numerical experiments are conducted, with the following results. (i) When the inner and outer spheres are put into steady differential rotation, the viscous torque exerted on the spheres oscillates quasiperiodically and persistently (after an initial transient). The fractional oscillation amplitude (∼ 10 ^- 2) increases with the <b>angular</b> <b>shear</b> and decreases with the gap width. (ii) When the outer sphere is accelerated impulsively after an interval of steady differential rotation, the torque increases suddenly, relaxes exponentially, then oscillates persistently as in (i). The relaxation time-scale is determined principally by the angular velocity jump, whereas the oscillation amplitude is determined principally by the gap width. (iii) When the mutual friction force changes suddenly from Hall-Vinen to Gorter-Mellink form, as happens when a rectilinear array of quantized Feynman-Onsager vortices is destabilized by a counterflow to form a reconnecting vortex tangle, the relaxation time-scale is reduced by a factor of ∼ 3 compared to (ii), and the system reaches a stationary state where the torque oscillates with fractional amplitude ∼ 10 ^- 3 about a constant mean value. Preliminary scalings are computed for observable quantities like angular velocity and acceleration as functions of Reynolds number, <b>angular</b> <b>shear,</b> and gap width.

We forecast parameter constraints on the triplet (Ω_m,w,σ_ 8) for an LSST-like photometric galaxy survey, using tomography of the shear-shear power spectrum, convergence peak counts and higher convergence moments. We find that redshift tomography with the power spectrum reduces the area of the 1 σ confidence interval in (Ω_m,w) space by a factor of 8 with respect to the case of the single highest redshift bin. We also find that adding non-Gaussian information from the peak counts and higher-order moments of the convergence field and its spatial derivatives further reduces the constrained area in (Ω_m,w) by a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. When we add cosmic microwave background parameter priors from Planck to our analysis, tomography improves power spectrum constraints by a factor of 3. Adding moments yields an improvement by an additional factor of 2, and adding both moments and peaks improves by almost a factor of 3, over power spectrum tomography alone. We evaluate the effect of uncorrected systematic photometric redshift errors on the parameter constraints. We find that different statistics lead to different bias directions in parameter space, suggesting the possibility of eliminating this bias via self-calibration.

Five non-potential parameters, i. e. electric current, current helicity, source field, photospheric free energy, and <b>angular</b> <b>shear,</b> are calculated to quantify the non-potentiality of NOAA AR 11158. Benefitting from the high spatial resolution, high cadence and continuous temporal coverage of vector mag-netograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, both the long-term evolution of the AR and the rapid change during flares are studied. We confirm that, compared with the magnetic flux, the magnetic non-potentiality has a closer connection with the flare, and the emerging flux regions are important for understanding the magnetic non-potentiality and flares. The main re-sults are as follows. (1) The vortex in the source field directly displays the deflection of the horizontal magnetic field.

The belt between the Alpine mountain range and the Mediterranean Sea, for example, differs markedly in its western and eastern parts. In the western part, around southeast France, the mountains are higher, but the seismicity lower, than in the eastern part, around northern Italy and Greece. Yet the inter-plate convergence rate of 6 mm=yr varies by less than 15 % between these two areas. To better understand the behaviour of this complex plate boundary, we use geodesy to map the spatial distribution of the deformation. In this paper, we focus on southeast France, a tectonic crossroads between three different domains (Alps, Ligurian Sea, and Massif Central) which exhibits a moderate level of seismicity. Here, the geodetic measurements imply low rates of horizontal deformation. By combining historical triangulation measurements mostly from 1947 to 1983 with Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys in 1993 and 1994, we estimate the rate of <b>angular</b> <b>shear</b> in triangular subnetworks covering the study area.

The geodetic estimates place an upper bound of 1 to 2 mm=yr on the slip rates of two seismically active structures, the Durance fault and the Nı̂mes fault, assuming a fault zone 20 km wide in each case.

For the active region studied, this <b>angular</b> difference (<b>shear)</b> is non-uniform along the neutral line with maxima occurring at the locations of repeated flare onsets. It is suggested that continued magnetic evolution causes the field's maximum shear to exceed a critical value of shear, resulting in a flare around the site of maximum shear.

A distorted crocodyliform fossil ofthe genus Baurusuchus Price, 1945, collected in theGeneral Salgado municipality (specimen MPMA 64 - 0002 / 04), São Paulo state, was used in an attempt todetermine the orientation of the strain ellipsoid in thesandstone block in which it is preserved. Previousinformation of the strain state was unavailablefrom macroscopic lithological structures. Using theassumption of homogeneous strain, we employed theprinciple of alteration of angular features at simpleshear, measuring orientation of planes that wereoriginally orthogonal. With a Brunton compass,strike and dip data were measured for symmetryplanes, such as the sagital plane in the skull and intwo sets of vertebrae (planes of the neural spines),as well as of features originally orthogonal to theseplanes, respectively the skull roof and the planescontaining the transverse processes in the vertebrae. The measurements were possible only because thefossil is still associated with its matrix, and thus thespatial relations between bones were maintained inmost of the specimen. However, the block was brokenin two portions during collecting and transport,separating a main slab with most of the fossil, froma secondary one, with more fragmentary elements. Afirst problem emerged, as part of the measurementsmust be taken on the secondary slab, to avoidsuperposition of data. Recognizable breakage lines,representing former contact between the two slabs,were also measured to serve as axes to re-orientatethe measurements taken on the secondary slab, so tothem coincide with the orientations of the main slab. Rotation of this data used specially devised gridsbased on the Schmidt and Billings equal area nets. The <b>angular</b> <b>shear</b> strain (ψ) was obtained directlyfrom stereographic projections, in three surfacesnormal to the intersection lines of the symmetryplanes, allowing to the calculation of the strain statesin these surfaces.

Although was possible todetermine a strain ellipsoid, it is tied only with theorientation of the fossil bones, and was impossibleto correlate it to field evidence (if any is available),once the fossil was collected without orientation datain situ. The strain ellipsoid obtained attests distortionof the sandstone, probably due to compaction ofadjacent rock layers of smaller grain size as well asby sedimentary overburden.

We construct numerical models accounting for tidal interactions, meridional circulation, transport of <b>angular</b> momentum, <b>shears</b> and horizontal turbulence and consider a variety of orbital periods and initial rotation velocities. Depending on orbital periods and rotation velocities, tidal effects may spin down (spin down Case) or spin up (spin up Case) the axial rotation. In both cases, tides may induce a large internal differential rotation. The resulting tidally induced shear mixing (TISM) is so efficient that the internal distributions of angular velocity and chemical elements are greatly influenced. The evolutionary tracks are modified, and in both cases of spin down and spin up, large amounts of nitrogen can be transported to the stellar surfaces before any binary mass transfer. Meridional circulation, when properly treated as an advection, always tends to counteract the tidal interaction, tending to spin up the surface when it is braked down and vice versa. As a consequence, the times needed for the axial angular velocity to become equal to the orbital angular velocity may be larger than given by typical synchronization timescales. Also, due to meridional circulation some differential rotation remains in tidally locked binary systems. Comment: 10 pages, 18 figures, Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} some results of experimental tests on solid clay brick masonry wallets ca. 130 × 140 cm subjected to simultaneously shearing {{perpendicular to the}} bed joints and vertical compression. <b>Angular</b> distortions and <b>shear</b> stiffness were calculated based on measured strains of masonry and applied shear forces. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine how the angular distortion depends on the shear stress and how the masonry shear stiffness changes with load increasing. The impact of the value of compressive stress perpendicular to the bed joints on shear stiffness was also tested. The results of investigations showed that relationship between the shear stresses and the angles of distortion were quite linear for shear stresses from 0 to τcr (τcr – shear stress accompanying first diagonal cracking). The τ-θ relationship was nonlinear after diagonal cracking. Distinctive hardening (increase of shear stresses) of cracked masonry was evident for the specimens simultaneously sheared and compressed. The hardening was stronger when the specimens were strongly compressed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOf {{concern in}} the paper is a study of {{unsteady}} flow of blood in a uniform arteriole segment under various boundary conditions at the wall. The blood vessel is modelled as an initially stressed orthotropic elastic tube filled with a viscous incompressible fluid representing blood which is treated here as a polar fluid. As for the equations governing {{the motion of the}} arteriole wall, we have taken a pair of appropriate equations derived in one of our earlier communications, by using suitable constitutive relations and the principle of superimposition of a small additional deformation on a state of known finite deformation. Numerical computations of the derived analytical expressions for velocity distribution, pressure, total <b>angular</b> velocity, wall <b>shear</b> stress, flow rate and resistance to fluid motion have been carried out. Variation of these quantities as functions of frequency and the system parameters have been studied with a view to illustrate the applicability of the mathematical model...|$|R
40|$|Helioseismology {{provides}} important constraints for {{the solar}} dynamo problem. However, the basic properties {{and even the}} depth of the dynamo process, which operates also in other stars, are unknown. Most of the dynamo models suggest that the toroidal magnetic field that emerges on the surface and forms sunspots is generated {{near the bottom of the}} convection zone, in the tachocline. However, there is a number of theoretical and observational problems with justifying the deep-seated dynamo models. This leads to the idea that the subsurface <b>angular</b> velocity <b>shear</b> may play an important role in the solar dynamo. Using helioseismology measurements of the internal rotation and meridional circulation, we investigate a mean-field MHD model of dynamo distributed in the bulk of the convection zone but shaped in a near-surface layer. We show that if the boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo region allow the large-scale toroidal magnetic fields to penetrate into the surface, then the dynamo wave propagates along the isosurface of angular velocity in the subsurface shear layer, forming the butterfly diagram in agreement with the Parker-Yoshimura rule and solar-cycle observations. Unlike the flux-transport dynamo models, this model does not depend on the transport of magnetic field by meridional circulation at the bottom of the convection zone, and works well when the meridional circulation forms two cells in radius, as recently indicated by deep-focus time-distance helioseismology analysis of the SDO/HMI and SOHO/MDI data. We compare the new dynamo model with various characteristics if the solar magnetic cycles, including the cycle asymmetry (Waldmeier's relations) and magnetic `butterfly' diagrams.

40|$|The {{effect of}} surface {{treatment}} on the theological properties of 20 and 40 wt. % short glass fibre reinforced polypropylenes (GF/PP) {{and of the}} same composites containing maleic anhydride modified polypropylene (GF/mPP/PP) were investigated. Glass fibres were surface-treated by aminosilane coupling agent (ASC, gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane). Steady state shear and dynamic properties in the molten state were measured using a cone and plate type rotational viscometer. Surface treatment increased the theological properties of the molten composites. This trend was more pronounced for composites containing modified PP. In {{the case of the}} GF/PP materials the increase was monotonous for all measured functions, while {{in the case of the}} GF/mPP/PPones, the parameters representing elasticity showed peaks at 0. 5 wt. % ASC. The Cox-Merz empirical law was found to be applicable to untreated GF/PP and GF/mPP/PP composites at low <b>shear</b> rates (<b>angular</b> frequencies), where the materials showed Newtonian plateaux. As for ASC surface treated materials, GF/mPP/PP followed the same trend. On the other hand, GF/PP exhibited a higher complex viscosity than the steady state shear one over the whole range of <b>angular</b> frequencies (<b>shear</b> rate) covered by the experiments. Surface treatment enhanced apparent yield stress, as did increasing the glass fibre content. The effect of the latter was more pronounced in the case of the GF/mPP/PP series. The viscosities of the re-mixed composites became lower than those of the original ones, and the difference between untreated and ASC treated systems was detectable only in the case of the complex viscosity of the GF/mPP/PP sample...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that very large {{magnetic}} fields are generated when the Quark-Gluon Plasma is formed during peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Lattice, holographic, and other studies strongly suggest that these fields may, for observationally relevant field values, induce "inverse magnetic catalysis", signalled by a lowering of the critical temperature for the chiral/deconfinement transition. The theoretical basis of this effect has recently attracted much attention; yet so far these investigations have not included another, equally dramatic consequence of the peripheral collision geometry: the QGP acquires a large angular momentum vector, parallel to the magnetic field. Here we use holographic techniques to argue that the angular momentum can also, independently, have an effect on transition temperatures, and we obtain a rough estimate of the relative effects of the presence of both a magnetic field and an angular momentum density. We find that the <b>shearing</b> <b>angular</b> momentum reinforces the effect of the magnetic field at low values of the baryonic chemical potential, but that it can actually decrease that effect at high chemical potentials.
