2500|$|Many NFL players {{commented on}} the ending, {{including}} several Packers players. Green Bay offensive lineman T. J. Lang tweeted after the game, [...] "Got fucked by the refs.. Embarrassing. Thanks nfl." [...] He later added, [...] "Fuck it NFL..

Lang openly admitted that his team was considering going on strike if the lockout was not resolved. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers responded by saying, [...] "First of all, I've got to do something that the NFL is not going to do: I have to apologize to the fans. Our sport is a multi-billion dollar machine, generated by people who pay good money to come watch us play. The product on the field is not being complemented by an appropriate set of officials. The games <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of control." [...] Green Bay head coach Mike McCarthy later stated he had been informed that Jennings had intercepted the pass.|$|E

60|$|I {{then said}} that I was sorry {{he had seen}} fit {{to change the subject}} so abruptly, because such conduct was very {{offensive}} to me; but under the circumstances I would overlook the matter and come to the point. I now went into an earnest expostulation with him upon the extravagant length of his report. I said it was expensive, unnecessary, and awkwardly constructed; there were no descriptive passages in it, no poetry, no sentiment--no heroes, no plot, no pictures--not even wood-cuts. Nobody would read it, that was a clear case. I urged him not to ruin his reputation by getting out a thing like that. If he ever hoped to succeed in literature he must throw more variety into his writings. He must beware of dry detail. I said that the main popularity of the almanac was derived from its poetry and conundrums, and that a few conundrums distributed around through his Treasury report would help the sale of it more than all the internal revenue he could put into it. I said these things in the kindest spirit, and yet the Secretary of the Treasury fell into a violent passion. He even said I was an ass. He abused me in the most vindictive manner, and said that if I came there again meddling with his business he would throw me out of the window. I said I would take my hat and go, if I could not be treated with the respect due to my office, and I did go. It was just like a new author.
