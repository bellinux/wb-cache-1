500|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} mature woodland with large, old trees, which provide extensive growth for foraging and nesting holes. In Europe, deciduous or mixed forest is favoured, particularly when containing oak. Parks, old orchards and other wooded habitats may be occupied {{as long as}} they have at least a [...] block of suitable trees. Particularly in mountains, old spruce and pine forests are used, and pine is also favoured in Taiwan. In most of Russia, conifers are used for nesting, but population densities are relatively low. Moroccan birds nest in oak, <b>Atlas</b> <b>cedar</b> and fir. Unusual habitats include dwarf juniper in Mongolia and rocky terrain in a limited part of southern Siberia.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Atlas</b> <b>Cedar</b> Biosphere Reserve (established 2016) is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve {{located in}} the central Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The {{biosphere}} reserve is home to 75% of the world’s majestic <b>Atlas</b> <b>cedar</b> (Cedrus atlantica) tree population. This part of the Atlas Mountains is rich in ecosystems and its peaks, reaching up to , provide the region with critically important water resources.
