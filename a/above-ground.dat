5|$|<b>Above-ground</b> {{construction}} commenced in September 2014. , {{the building}} has reached the 58th floor {{and is expected to}} be completed in 2019.|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} {{platform}} screen doors {{to be installed}} at <b>above-ground</b> stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at <b>above-ground</b> stations. Underground stations already featured platform screen doors since 1987. The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs, but made an about-turn when the government announced plans to install half-height platform screen doors on the <b>above-ground</b> stations in January 2008, citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide. They were first installed at Jurong East, Pasir Ris and Yishun stations in 2009 under trials to test their feasibility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Above-ground</b> {{nuclear tests}} by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s and by France into the 1970s and 1980s spread a {{significant}} amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world. Additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents.|$|E
5|$|Although {{described}} as a satellite terminal, the terminal building is connected by an <b>above-ground</b> corridor to Terminal 2. Departures {{take place on the}} lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck. All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers.|$|E
5|$|Although in most cacti, {{the stem}} {{acts as the}} main organ for storing water, some cacti have in {{addition}} large taproots. These may be several times {{the length of the}} <b>above-ground</b> body in the case of species such as Copiapoa atacamensis, which grows in one of the driest places in the world, the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.|$|E
5|$|By July 1993 {{the game}} was behind schedule; only the <b>above-ground</b> {{portions}} of the pyramid were complete. Jones put in eighteen-hour days for the month {{leading up to the}} MacWorld Expo where {{the game was}} to be sold; he finished the game in a relatively bug-free state just before the Expo, and Bungie had 500shrinkwrapped copies of the game available for sale at MacWorld.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{demolition}} in 1996 {{of all of}} the <b>above-ground</b> structure of the South station, foundations, culverts and more remained. These needed to be removed before construction could start. The removal of these underground structures was completed in early 2007, whereupon construction of the houses began immediately.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Derbyshire County Council spent £2,000 {{installing}} underground {{telegraph wire}} cables beneath the road, as the <b>above-ground</b> installations were continually broken and disrupted following snowstorms. The British winter of 2010–11 was the coldest {{for decades and}} the road was closed on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 2008, the FTA {{reversed}} the earlier decision and approved the <b>above-ground</b> project, {{saying that it}} met standards for cost efficiency, construction and ridership, moving it closer to receiving the $900 million in federal funding. Officials told The Washington Post that the project would move into the final design stage. The FTA approved funding for the project on December 4, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The 1940 manning of the ouvrage {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Bourguignon {{comprised}} 97 men and 3 officers of the 155th Fortress Infantry Regiment (155th RIF) and the 169th Position Artillery Regiment (169th RAP). The units were under the umbrella of the Second Army, Army Group 1. The Casernement de Montmédy provided peacetime <b>above-ground</b> barracks and support services to La Ferté and other fortifications in the area.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2010 Buckton Castle was {{investigated}} by archaeologists, first the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford's Centre for Applied Archaeology {{as part of}} the Tameside Archaeology Survey. More than 60 volunteers were involved in the project. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and close to the Buckton Vale Quarry. The castle is overgrown with heather and peat, and there are no <b>above-ground</b> ruins.|$|E
5|$|Except for the partly {{at-grade}} Bishan MRT Station (North South Line), {{the entirety}} of the MRT is elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations are deep and hardened enough to withstand conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters. Mobile phone and 3G service is available in every part of the network. Underground stations and the trains themselves are air-conditioned, while <b>above-ground</b> stations have ceiling fans installed.|$|E
5|$|Some on-street {{track was}} laid {{in a special}} {{foundation}} with cobbled road surfacing designed to be sympathetic with the style of Edinburgh streets but was removed in many places due to objections from cyclists. The trams are powered by overhead cables attached to purpose-built poles or mounted {{on the sides of}} buildings. Nine electrical sub-stations were planned for the line to Newhaven, both underground and <b>above-ground</b> but only five were built after the line was truncated at York Place.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{scheduled}} for remodeling {{as part of the}} $2 billion Smithsonian South Mall project. Plans from the Danish architects, Bjarke Ingels Group, would replace the <b>above-ground</b> pavilion with new mall-facing entrances. The renovation is supported by private and federal investment, and was expected to begin in 2016 and finish in 10 to 20 years. Yinka Shonibare's Wind Sculpture VII was put on permanent display outside the museum in late 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{focal point}} of the Cycle Center is an atrium that introduces the two lower levels of facilities and provides an aesthetic <b>above-ground</b> presence. The atrium, which has been praised by Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin more than once, has a sloping solar paneled roof. The 120solar panels produce 6.5percent of the electricity supply required for the climate-controlled building. The Cycle Center has an opaque design, with thin steel frames for its main windows. The interior design uses stainless steel and blond wood, and shade is produced by awnings.|$|E
5|$|The secotioid and gasteroid {{species in}} Lactarius and Russula {{are derived from}} agaricoid forms. Secotioid species still have a stipe but the cap does not open fully, while in gasteroid species, fruitbodies are {{completely}} closed and the stipe is reduced; in both cases, the spore-bearing structure {{is made up of}} convoluted gills that are more or less crowded and anastomosed. These closed-fruitbody species represent a continuum of secotioid to gasteroid, <b>above-ground</b> to below-ground fruitbodies, with spores forcibly discharged or not. Secotioid or gasteroid Lactarius exude latex just like their agaricoid relatives.|$|E
5|$|Tumbleweeds, {{which are}} the <b>above-ground</b> {{portions}} of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include Kali tragus (also known as Salsola tragus), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and has gained {{a reputation as a}} noxious weed. Fungi of the genus Bovista are known to use the same strategy to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|While {{chairman}} of the AEC, Seaborg participated on the negotiating team for the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), in which the US, UK, and USSR agreed to ban all <b>above-ground</b> test detonations of nuclear weapons. Seaborg considered his contributions to {{the achievement of the}} LTBT as one of his greatest accomplishments. Despite strict rules from the Soviets about photography at the signing ceremony, Seaborg snuck a tiny camera past the Soviet guards to take a close-up photograph of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as he signed the treaty.|$|E
5|$|A 1,000-car <b>above-ground</b> parking garage, {{owned by}} the state, is located south of the stadium's center field {{entrance}} on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. As the garage is used by state employees during the day, game attendees are only {{able to use it}} for evening and weekend games. Other state-owned free parking lots and paid private lots are located in the vicinity. The Metro Transit Authority's Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue North and Harrison Street. Nashville BCycle, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|Alice (Milla Jovovich) {{wakes up}} disoriented in a mansion {{laying in the}} showers floor. She wanders through the halls, where she defeats several obstacles, {{including}} a deadly laser beam obstacle and a giant blade that falls from the ceiling. However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be a clone. The camera zooms out to show a shack camouflaging the facility's <b>above-ground</b> entrance - {{with the rest of}} the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.|$|E
5|$|As the American and South Korean forces {{approached}} the Chinese defenses, they {{were met with}} grenades, Bangalore torpedoes, shaped charges and rocks. Unable to safely advance, American and South Korean troops were forced to rely on close-support artillery to subdue Chinese resistance, but a complex network of bunkers and tunnels allowed the Chinese to bring up reinforcements as the <b>above-ground</b> troops were depleted. Although the 31st Infantry Regiment was equipped with ballistic vests in the first mass military deployment of modern personal armor; its 1st and 3rd battalions nevertheless suffered 96 fatalities, with an additional 337 men wounded in the first attack – the heaviest casualties the 31st Infantry Regiment had suffered {{in a single day}} during the war.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying <b>above-ground</b> livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} was a two-storey building with a basement. The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation. The purpose of the buildings along {{the west end of}} the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three <b>above-ground</b> floors, and there was a basement underneath.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 the Whitechapel & Bow Railway was opened, {{linking the}} District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an <b>above-ground</b> {{junction}} at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley-by-Bow station, and some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham. When the line was electrified in 1906 services to Richmond were withdrawn and the western termini became Hammersmith and Kensington (Addison Road), and to the east services were diverted from the ELR to Whitechapel, until the ELR was electrified in 1914 and services ran from Hammersmith to New Cross (SER) and New Cross (LB). The 6-car electric multiple units were jointly owned by the Met and GWR until 1923 when the GWR sold theirs to the Met.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Salomon's three sons, Avraham, Ovadia and Danny, assumed {{managerial}} positions; {{they became}} co-CEOs after Salomon's death in 1966. In 1958 Angel's Bakery moved to its present {{location in the}} Givat Shaul industrial zone {{at the corner of}} Beit Hadfus and Farbstein Streets. The site was chosen because it stood across the street from a flour mill. The Angel brothers built Israel's first flour silo and commissioned a Texas company to construct a 750-foot pipeline to convey flour directly from the mill to the silo to the bakery. Today this pipeline brings 120 tons of flour to the bakery daily. The invention, initially opposed by the Jerusalem municipality for being <b>above-ground,</b> won the Kaplan Prize for distinction in productivity and efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette Square is one {{of three}} squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most {{important}} space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs <b>above-ground</b> along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a one-way westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection to Clinton Street).|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous <b>above-ground</b> nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in <b>above-ground</b> stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
5|$|The early {{farmers from}} the Early Basketmaker II Era, {{lived in the}} Petrified Forest from about 1CE to about 800CE. They {{occupied}} pit houses at fewer than 100 sites, at first on mesas or other vantage points and later {{at the base of}} bluffs and in lowlands, where the soil was better. As climatic conditions worsened for farming between 750 and 900CE, the settlements changed with the Pueblo I Era. Rather than below-ground pits, the Pueblo Builders constructed <b>above-ground</b> houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for more than one year. At the same time, climatic conditions changed again, this time for the better, between 900 and 1275CE. More than 200 pueblo-builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations—at the mouths of washes, near seeps, and on moisture-holding sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The line {{starts at}} an {{interlocking}} north of Jay Street–MetroTech, where Culver Line trains can access the IND Sixth Avenue Line or IND Eighth Avenue Line, south to Church Avenue in Kensington, {{the line is}} mostly a four-track subway, though it rises to cross over the Gowanus Canal on the only <b>above-ground</b> structure on the original Independent Subway System. In Kensington, a ramp allows the line to rise onto a three-track elevated structure built by the City for operation by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company {{as part of the}} Dual Contracts. When this ramp was opened in 1954, the older route from Kensington northwest to Sunset Park remained as the Culver Shuttle until it was closed in 1975. The final portion of the line in Coney Island is on the lower level of a double-decked elevated structure, with the BMT Brighton Line above.|$|E
5|$|The {{main base}} was then {{subjected}} to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets {{slammed into the}} base, leveling most of the <b>above-ground</b> structures. One of the first enemy shells set off {{an explosion in the}} main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after another shell hit a cache of tear gas, which saturated the entire area. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of C-4 and other explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{earliest}} human inhabitants {{arrived at}} least 8,000 years ago. By about 2,000 years ago, {{they were growing}} corn {{in the area and}} shortly thereafter building pit houses in what would become the park. Later inhabitants built <b>above-ground</b> dwellings called pueblos. Although a changing climate caused the last of the park's pueblos to be abandoned by about 1400CE, more than 600 archeological sites, including petroglyphs, have been discovered in the park. In the 16thcentury, Spanish explorers visited the area, and by the mid-19thcentury a U.S. team had surveyed an east–west route through the area where the park is now located and noted the petrified wood. Later, roads and a railway followed similar routes and gave rise to tourism and, before the park was protected, to large-scale removal of fossils. Theft of petrified wood remains a problem in the 21stcentury.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{cultivated}} Cucurbita {{species has}} five-lobed or palmately divided leaves with long petioles, with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the <b>above-ground</b> parts may be hairy with {{various types of}} trichomes, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each node and are branching in some species. C.argyrosperma has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of C.pepo leaves varies widely. C.moschata plants can have light or dense pubescence. C.ficifolia leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species {{may or may not}} have white spots.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 the {{nominally}} independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received {{permission for}} a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an <b>above-ground</b> junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley station. The LT and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train each morning and evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} royal tombs at Vergina, {{professional}} painters decorated {{the walls with}} a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone and royal hunting scenes, while lavish grave goods including weapons, armor, drinking vessels, and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a diadem, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about {{the identity of the}} tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 1977–1978, and recent research and forensic examination have concluded {{that at least one of}} the persons buried was PhilipII. Located near Tomb1 are the <b>above-ground</b> ruins of a heroon, a shrine for cult worship of the dead. In 2014, the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb was discovered outside of Amphipolis and is the largest ancient tomb found in Greece (as of 2017).|$|E
5|$|Often {{people try}} to avoid or outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Although cars can travel faster than the average tornado, the {{directive}} from the National Weather Service is for house-dwellers {{in the path of}} a tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle. This is a result of several factors and statistics. An interior room inside a well-built frame house (especially one with a basement) provides a reasonable degree of protection from all but the most violent tornadoes. Underground or <b>above-ground</b> tornado shelters, as well as extremely strong structures such as bank vaults, offer almost complete protection. Cars, on the other hand, can be heavily damaged by even weak tornadoes, and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances, even into buildings. High-profile vehicles such as buses and tractor trailers are even more vulnerable to high winds.|$|E
