He was the oldest of five {{children}} born to Rade Đujić and his wife Ljubica ( [...] Miloš). The family was of Bosnian origin. Rade had moved to Kovačić with his disabled veteran father, Glišo, and his brother, Nikola, in the late 1880s and lived off his father's Austro-Hungarian Army pension for a time. Ljubica hailed from the village of Ljubač, southeast of Knin.

500|$|In 1932, Hensley and {{his family}} moved to Pineville, Kentucky, after a {{religious}} layman, who had seen Hensley handle snakes in Chattanooga, entreated him to come to the area. He returned to ministry and built the Pineville Church of God. Hensley established the church himself and characterized it as a [...] "free Pentecostal" [...] church. He continued to move frequently, a practice which Thomas Burton of East Tennessee State University attributes to [...] "wanderlust". In July 1935, Irene gave birth to a child in Pennington Gap, Virginia, and a month later, they were living in St. Charles, Virginia, while Hensley performed snake-handling services in the area. He successfully drew crowds to his preaching. In Norton, Virginia, 500 people attended an event, although that service was thrown into disarray after a boy in the audience killed one of the snakes. In 1936, Hensley built a house {{on the back of a}} trailer truck and drove to Florida to hold revival services. By March 1936, he had reached Tampa, Florida, where he drew over 100 people to a snake-handling service. He traveled to Bartow, Florida, where over 700 people attended one of his tent meetings. He subsequently ministered in Bloomingdale, Florida, before traveling north to Barrow County, Georgia, in late April. During a service in Barrow, a young <b>agricultural</b> <b>worker</b> was bitten by a snake and became ill. Hensley spoke to reporters and claimed that the man was bitten because he was [...] "not quite ready for the demonstrations of the power". He predicted that the young man would miraculously recover, but the man died. This was the first death by snakebite to occur at one of Hensley's services. He conducted the man's funeral and left the area for fear of prosecution. His conduct was condemned by a local newspaper.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of job {{exposure}} and its duration on chronic respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity among <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers.</b> METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including 120 <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> aged 36 to 53 years, compared to {{an equal number of}} office workers matched by age, duration of workplace exposure and smoking status. A questionnaire was used to record the chronic respiratory symptoms, detailed job history, specific job activities and tasks performed, and smoking history. Evaluation of examined subjects also included functional lung testing by spirometry. RESULTS: We found non-significantly higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the last 12 months in <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> with significant difference for cough (P = 0. 044), and wheezing (P = 0. 031). Mean values of all spirometric parameters were lower in <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers,</b> being significantly different for MEF 50 (P = 0. 001) and MEF 75 (P = 0. 000). Adverse respiratory effects and lung function deterioration were more expressed in <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> with duration of job exposure more than 20 years than in those exposed less than 20 years. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that workplace exposure in <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> may lead to respiratory impairment which is close related to its duration...|$|R

A manual weed removal study was conducted to determine the occupational risk of injury for seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> hired for canola crops.

40|$|Objective : In this {{research}} we aimed {{to determine the}} status of seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> located in two housing units in terms of living, working and health conditions.  Methods: This is a descriptive study using qualitative methods: in-depth interviews and in situ observations. It took place in provinces of Adana and Mersin located in the Çukurova region and the Şanlıurfa province. A common feature of these provinces is their high density of seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers.</b> Our field work was performed by going to places where seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> live and work. The research was conducted during the dates of March 2014 and August 2014. Snowball sampling methods was used in {{this research}}. Data were collected by interviews with 26 seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> who were older than 15. Results: Seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> were working without social insurance, safe transportation facilities, or guarantee of employment and without any worker’s health and safety precautions being taken by the employees. Accommodation units lacked fundamental structural and safety features. Seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> were faced with social alienation and could not access the basic health services such as vaccination, antenatal follow-up, reproductive health or outpatient services. Also, their diet was unbalanced and insufficient. Children could not take the benefit sufficiently from education and were employed in agricultural work. In addition to their agricultural work, women also were exploited in their domestic life. Conclusion: Seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> were in an aggrieved position concerning topics such as transportation, accommodation, wages and social insurance. To eliminate these conditions, the opinion of agricultural middlemen, seasonal <b>agricultural</b> <b>workers</b> and employees should be taken into account with the financial support of local authorities under the scope of the law.  </p...|$|R

2500|$|The {{vocation}} of {{the bulk}} of the population, close to 75%, was agricultural. There were three classes of <b>agricultural</b> <b>worker.</b> The first were the free landowners. They owned and farmed their own property and were not tied to the estate of a lord or landowner. The second were those involved in specialty agriculture like animal husbandry. Some of this group actually marketed their skill to breed and maintain the livestock of the landowners. The third and largest group were the ordinary peasants or serfs. Serfdom was abolished by King Joseph Bonaparte in 1806, but the lot of the peasants didn't improve much afterward. These peasant farmers were mostly sharecroppers who lived a [...] "hand-to mouth" [...] subsistence lifestyle.|$|E

60|$|Ideas {{that are}} unhampered by {{political}} intrigue or financial considerations have a sweeping way with them, and before a year {{was out the}} records of the council show clearly that it was rising to its enormous opportunity, and partly through its own direct control and partly through a series of specific committees, it was planning a new common social order for the entire population of the earth. 'There can be no real social stability or any general human happiness while large areas of the world and large classes of people are in a phase of civilisation different from the prevailing mass. It is impossible now to have great blocks of population misunderstanding the generally accepted social purpose or at an economic disadvantage to the rest.' So the council expressed its conception of the problem it had to solve. The peasant, the field-worker, and all barbaric cultivators were at an 'economic disadvantage' to the more mobile and educated classes, and the logic of the situation compelled the council to take up systematically the supersession of this stratum by a more efficient organisation of production. It developed a scheme for the progressive establishment throughout the world of the 'modern system' in agriculture, a system that should give the full advantages of a civilised life to every <b>agricultural</b> <b>worker,</b> and this replacement has been going on right up to the present day. The central idea of the modern system is the substitution of cultivating guilds for the individual cultivator, and for cottage and village life altogether. These guilds are associations {{of men and women who}} take over areas of arable or pasture land, and make themselves responsible for a certain average produce. They are bodies small enough as a rule to be run on a strictly democratic basis, and large enough to supply all the labour, except for a certain assistance from townspeople during the harvest, needed upon the land farmed. They have watchers' bungalows or chalets on the ground cultivated, but the ease and the costlessness of modern locomotion enables them to maintain a group of residences in the nearest town with a common dining-room and club house, and usually also a guild house in the national or provincial capital. Already this system has abolished a distinctively 'rustic' population throughout vast areas of the old world, where it has prevailed immemorially. That shy, unstimulated life of the lonely hovel, the narrow scandals and petty spites and persecutions of the small village, that hoarding, half inanimate existence away from books, thought, or social participation and in constant contact with cattle, pigs, poultry, and their excrement, is passing away out of human experience. In a little while it will be gone altogether. In the nineteenth century it had already ceased to be a necessary human state, and only the absence of any collective intelligence and an imagined need for tough and unintelligent soldiers and for a prolific class at a low level, prevented its systematic replacement at that time....|$|E
