25|$|Capacitance {{may also}} change with <b>applied</b> <b>voltage.</b> This effect is more {{prevalent}} in class 2 ceramic capacitors. The permittivity of ferroelectric class 2 material depends on the <b>applied</b> <b>voltage.</b> Higher <b>applied</b> <b>voltage</b> lowers permittivity. The change of capacitance can drop to 80% of the value measured with the standardized measuring voltage of 0.5 or 1.0nbsp&V. This behavior is a small source of non-linearity in low-distortion filters and other analog applications. In audio applications this can be the reason for harmonic distortion.|$|E

40|$|Non-Hebbian {{learning}} is often encountered in different bio-organisms. In these processes, {{the strength of}} a synapse connecting two neurons is controlled not only by the signals exchanged between the neurons, but also by an additional factor external to the synaptic structure. Here we show the implementation of non-Hebbian learning in a single solid-state resistive memory device. The output of our device is controlled not only by the <b>applied</b> <b>voltages,</b> but also by the illumination conditions under which it operates. We demonstrate that our metal/oxide/semiconductor device learns more efficiently at higher <b>applied</b> <b>voltages</b> but also when light, an external parameter, is present during the information writing steps. Conversely, memory erasing is more efficiently at higher <b>applied</b> <b>voltages</b> and in the dark.
