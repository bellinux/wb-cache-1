25|$|When the {{cafeteria}} bombs failed to explode, Harris and Klebold convened <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> school. Both armed, they {{climbed to the}} top of the outdoor west entrance steps, placing them on a level with the athletic fields west of the building and the library inside the west entrance, directly above {{the cafeteria}}. From this vantage point, the cafeteria's west entrance was located at the bottom of the staircase, next to the senior parking lot.|$|E
25|$|Utilizing {{available}} forensic data, Robert Graysmith {{postulated that}} another car {{pulled into the}} turnout, just prior to 11:00pm and parked beside the couple. The killer apparently exited the second car <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Rambler, possibly ordering the couple out of the Rambler. Jensen appeared to have exited the car first, yet when Faraday was halfway out, the killer apparently shot Faraday in the head. Fleeing from the killer, Jensen was gunned down twenty-eight feet from the car with five shots through her back. The killer then drove off.|$|E
2500|$|Around 10:50p.m., the Lennons' {{limousine}} {{returned to}} the Dakota. Lennon and Ono got out, passed Chapman <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> archway entrance of the building. From the street behind them, Chapman fired five shots from a [...]38 special revolver, four of which hit Lennon {{in the back and}} shoulder puncturing the left lung and left subclavian artery.|$|E
60|$|After {{that answer}} they both remain {{silent for a}} little while, then rise from <b>the</b> bench <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
50|$|His novels, {{published}} by Macmillan, were Six Angels at My Back (1952), Wait, Son, October Is Near (1953) <b>and</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> Rainbow (1954).|$|R
50|$|The head couple separate. The man turns {{outwards}} <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> foot {{directly behind}} the men's line, followed by all the men in single file. At {{the same time the}} head lady does the same thing on her side of the set.|$|R
2500|$|After firing {{through the}} windows at {{evacuating}} students and the police, Klebold fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall. He removed his trench coat. As Klebold fired at the three, Harris grabbed his shotgun <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lower row of computer desks, firing a single shot under the first desk without looking. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. Harris then shot under the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, [...] "Quit your bitching." ...|$|E
2500|$|They shot toward {{students}} standing {{close to}} a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They walked toward the west entrance, throwing pipe bombs, very few of which detonated. Meanwhile, inside the school, Patti Nielson, an art teacher, had noticed the commotion <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west entrance with a 17-year-old student, Brian Anderson. She had intended to walk outside to tell the two students to [...] "Knock it off," [...] thinking Klebold and Harris were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened {{the first set of}} double doors, Harris and Klebold shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass and hitting Nielson in the shoulder with shrapnel. Nielson stood and ran back down the hall into the library, alerting the students inside to the danger and telling them to get under desks and keep silent. Nielson dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter. Anderson remained behind, caught between the exterior and interior doors.|$|E
2500|$|On September 29, 1981, Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker {{was shot}} and killed along a stretch of highway a few miles north of Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. Rucker's body, {{discovered}} by a passer-by, was lying beside his patrol car. He {{had been shot in the}} head. Around the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a speeding vehicle traveling on the same road away from where Rucker's body had been found. [...] Carrisalez and his partner turned on the patrol car's flashing red lights and pursued the vehicle, which pulled over. Carrisalez took a flashlight <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> car. The driver of the vehicle opened his door and exchanged words with Carrisalez before firing at least one shot at Carrisalez' chest. He died nine days later. Leonel Torres Herrera was arrested a few days later and was charged with the capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker.|$|E

50|$|Realizing that George is too terrified to face Harold, Lou Glover asks George for his gun. Glover {{intends to}} pose as George {{for the sake}} of the town.

60|$|I watched Duncan out {{of sight}} and then turned <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R

60|$|Rodwell was puzzled. He rose {{slowly to}} his feet, however, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> basin {{at the other}} end of the apartment.|$|E
50|$|At {{the lake}} house, Kate drops {{to her knees}} sobbing, fearing that she has arrived too late to stop Alex. After a long pause, the mailbox flag finally lowers; Alex has picked up her note. Not long afterwards, a {{familiar}} mint-green truck pulls up. She walks forward smiling as the driver, clad {{in jeans and a}} familiar tan jacket, approaches. She and Alex kiss <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lake house.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do," [...] said Jack finally. [...] "You keep out of sight, and I'll go out on <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house <b>and</b> knock on the door. Then, if anybody comes, I'll say that I'm out hunting {{and would like to}} buy a bit to eat. They can't refuse me a bite, and that will give me a little chance to look around while I'm inside." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Thorne looked up, partly dazzled {{with the}} level sunrays in his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> wagon. When he stopped beside it Mrs. Farquhar greeted him.|$|E
60|$|Hal {{turned into}} the building, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear. A ladder stood lashed to the back wall. The youth hesitated, and then mounted to the floor above.|$|E
60|$|The Captain {{shouldered}} {{the basket}} <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sea with it, and Sally retired {{to her own}} little room to hold a farewell consultation with her mirror before she went.|$|E
60|$|The boy nodded. He {{got to his}} feet, {{stared down}} at <b>the</b> shoes, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door, where he turned.|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't {{have too}} many to please me," [...] Teddy replied, boldly; and then, to Carrots's surprise, he turned <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> {{directly}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> enemy.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy bowed, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> rapidly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house. At the door, {{he stopped}} and looked back. The two were {{standing}} where he had left them.|$|R
60|$|On uttering this advice, {{which he}} did also {{somewhat}} pointedly, the Chippewa left the spring, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kennel of Hive, where the bee-hunter was busy feeding his old companion.|$|E
60|$|Flett nodded <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door, and George {{felt the}} sudden fall of {{temperature}} {{and heard the}} scream of the wind. In a minute or two, however, the constable reappeared with Edgar.|$|E
60|$|The Kid put up his gun, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. But {{he turned}} again {{and came back}} to the {{trembling}} Thacker, and held up his left hand with its back toward the consul.|$|E

6000|$|... "I believe I'll have a sun-bath," [...] said Prickly Porky, <b>and</b> lazily <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} Green Forest {{in search}} of a place where the sun lay warm and bright.|$|R
60|$|After a while Prescott {{stopped his}} binder {{and opened a}} box {{attached}} to it. He closed it sharply, as if annoyed, called {{to one of the}} men gathering up <b>the</b> sheaves, <b>and</b> then <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
60|$|Jeanne turned <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. On the threshold, however, she paused. There {{were many}} times, she remembered, when her {{stepmother}} had {{been kind to}} her. She {{looked around at the}} Princess, sitting with her head resting upon her clasped hands.|$|E
60|$|Wakem rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door, but {{something}} held him back, {{and instead of}} leaving the room, he {{walked up and down}} it. Philip was slow to reply, and when he spoke, his tone had a more incisive quietness and clearness than ever.|$|E
60|$|The last dozen {{words were}} spoken {{in a loud}} tone, {{as if for the}} benefit of the {{stranger}} in the rear; but instead of waiting to hear more the latter turned abruptly <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> package with a green covering at the end of the platform.|$|E
60|$|Captain Grady {{remained}} at the gateway, his baneful eyes on them until the trees hid them from view. Then he shut the heavy gate <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house, rubbing his grizzled chin reflectively.|$|R
