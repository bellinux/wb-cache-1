The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war</b> because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war</b> and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors.

The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation.

5|$|Europe was {{immersed}} in power struggles on many different fronts. The Christian Church split along Latin Orthodox lines in 1054 after centuries of disagreement {{leading to a}} permanent division called the East–West Schism. Following the Gregorian Reform, an assertive, reformist papacy attempted to increase its power and influence over the laity. Beginning around 1075 and continuing during the First Crusade, the Investiture Controversy was a power struggle between Church and state in medieval Europe over whether the Catholic Church or the Holy Roman Empire held the right to appoint church officials and other clerics. Antipope Clement III was an alternative pope {{for most of this}} period, and Pope Urban spent much of his early pontificate in exile from Rome. The result was intense piety and an increased interest in religious affairs amongst the general population in Catholic Europe and religious propaganda by the Papacy advocating <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war</b> to reclaim Palestine from the Muslims. Participation in a crusade was seen as a form of penance that could counterbalance sin.|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} this justification {{is that it}} does not fulfill one of the requirements of <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war</b> and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.|$|E

500|$|The {{traditional}} {{identification of}} the battle site with Oswestry, probably in the territory of Powys at the time, suggests that Penda may have had British allies in this battle, and this is also suggested by surviving Welsh poetry which has been thought to indicate {{the participation of the}} men of Powys in the battle. It has also been considered that, if the traditional {{identification of the}} site as Oswestry is correct, Oswald was on the offensive, in the territory of his enemies. This could conflict with Bede's saintly portrayal of Oswald, since an aggressive war could hardly qualify as <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war,</b> perhaps explaining why Bede is silent on the cause of the war—he says only that Oswald died [...] "fighting for his fatherland"—as well as his failure to mention other offensive warfare Oswald is presumed to have engaged in between Heavenfield and Maserfield. Oswald may have had an ally in Penda's brother Eowa, who was also killed in the battle, according to the Historia Britonnum and Annales Cambriae; while the source only mentions that Eowa was killed, not the side on which he fought, it has been speculated that Eowa was subject to Oswald and fighting alongside him in the battle, in opposition to Penda.|$|E

40|$|The {{permissible}} use {{of defensive}} force {{is a central}} tenet of the traditional legal and philosophical justification for war and its practice. <b>Just</b> <b>War</b> Theory holds <b>a</b> nation’s right to resist aggressive attack with defensive force as the clearest example of <b>a</b> <b>just</b> cause for <b>war.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>War</b> Theory also stipulates norms for warfare derived from a conception of defensive force asserted {{to be consistent with}} the moral reality of war.

Together with the Vijaya myth, it introduces the bases for the Sinhalese Buddhist belief that Lord Buddha designated the island of Sri Lanka as a repository for Theravada Buddhism. It claims the Sinhalese were the first humans to inhabit the island (as those who predated the Sinhalese were subhuman) and are thus the true [...] "sons of the soil".

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Marburg Colloquy, Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army. Luther had argued against {{resisting}} the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses, provoking accusations of defeatism. He saw the Turks as a scourge sent by God to punish Christians, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church. He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War, [...] "as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name". On the other hand, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms, Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks. In 1526, he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war.</b> By 1529, in On War against the Turk, he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks.|$|E
2500|$|Although some Catholic clergy, {{religious}} orders and Popes owned slaves, and the naval galleys of the Papal States were to use captured Muslim galley slaves, Roman Catholic teaching {{began to turn}} more strongly against [...] "unjust" [...] forms of slavery in general, beginning in 1435, prohibiting the enslavement of the recently baptised, culminating in pronouncements by Pope Paul III in 1537. However, when the Age of Discovery greatly {{increased the number of}} slaves owned by Christians, the response of the church, under strong political pressures, was confused and ineffective in preventing the establishment of slave societies in the colonies of Catholic countries. Papal bulls such as Dum Diversas, Romanus Pontifex and their derivatives, sanctioned slavery and were used to justify enslavement of natives and the appropriation of their lands during this era. The depopulation of the Americas, and consequently the shortage of slaves, that came about through diseases allegedly brought over by the Europeans, and the harsh treatment of the native populations, inspired increasing debate during the 16th century over the morality of slavery. [...] The first extensive shipment of black Africans to make good the shortage of native slaves, what would later become known as the Transatlantic slave trade, was initiated at the request of Bishop Las Casas and authorised by Charles V in 1517. La Casas later rejected all forms of slavery and became famous as the great protector of Indian rights. No Papal condemnation of Transatlantic slave trade was made at the time. La Casas in 1547 declared that the Spanish never waged <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war</b> against the Indians since they did not have a just cause for doing so.|$|E

2500|$|D. S. Senanayake, {{who would}} become Sri Lanka's first prime {{minister}} in 1947, reaffirmed in 1939 the common Mahavamsa-based assumption of the Sinhalese Buddhist responsibility for the island's destiny by proclaiming that the Sinhalese Buddhists [...] "are one blood and one nation. We are a chosen people. Buddha said that his religion would last for 5,500 [...] years. That means that we, as the custodians of that religion, shall last as long." [...] Buddhists monks became increasingly involved in post-independence politics, promoting Sinhalese Buddhist interests, {{at the expense of}} minorities. Walpola Rahula, Sri Lanka's foremost Buddhist monk scholar and one of the leading proponents of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism, {{played a major role in}} advocating for the involvement of monks in politics, using Buddhist king Dutthagamani's relationship with the sangha to bolster his position. Rahula also argued for <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>war</b> doctrine to protect Buddhism by using the example of wars waged by Dutthagamani to restore Buddhism. Rahula maintained that [...] "the entire Sinhalese race was united under the banner of the young Gamini [...] This was the beginning of nationalism among the Sinhalese. It was a new race with healthy young blood, organized under the new order of Buddhism. A kind of religionationalism, which almost amounted to fanaticism, roused the whole Sinhalese people. A non-Buddhist was not regarded as a human being. Evidently all Sinhalese without exception were Buddhists." [...] In reflecting on Rahula's works, anthropologist H.L. Seneviratne writes that, [...] "it suits Rahula to be an advocate of a Buddhism that glorifies social intercourse with lay society ... the receipt of salaries and other forms of material remuneration; ethnic exclusivism and Sinhala Buddhist hegemony; militancy in politics; and violence, war and the spilling of blood in the name of [...] "preserving the religion"".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2013, {{two years}} after the {{assassination}} of Osama bin Laden, Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term global war on terror put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. <...> But {{we have to recognize that}} the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. <...> From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation [...] — [...] and world [...] — [...] that we leave to our children. [...] So America is at a crossroads. [...] We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. [...] We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” [...] <...> In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security. <...> [...] Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. [...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces. [...] We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.
