5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an <b>article</b> <b>entitled</b> The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reference}} to the nickname of Senators was in a game report ("The Ottawas Made a Good Start") of the Ottawa Journal on January 7, 1901 and used in other newspapers around that time. While the nickname was used occasionally, the club continued {{to be known as}} the Ottawa Hockey Club. In 1909, a separate Ottawa Senators pro team existed in the Federal League. Ottawa newspapers referred to that club as the Senators, and the Ottawa HC as 'Ottawa', 'Ottawas' or the 'Ottawa Pro Hockey Club'. The Globe newspaper of Toronto first refers to the Ottawa Hockey Club as the Senators in an <b>article</b> <b>entitled</b> 'Quebec defeated Ottawa' on December 30, 1912. Eventually this became the official nickname, and was the only name used in descriptions of the club in NHL play.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the Commission's {{proposal}} {{to a wider}} audience and described what the graves would look like. The <b>article</b> <b>entitled</b> War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, Graves of the Fallen. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following {{the publication of the}} reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the Commission's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles.|$|E

25|$|Haggard also owed a {{considerable}} debt to Joseph Thomson, the Scottish explorer whose book Through Masai Land {{was a hit}} in January 1885. Thomson had terrified warriors in Kenya by taking out his false teeth and claiming to be a magician, just as Captain Good does in King Solomon's Mines. Contemporary James Runciman wrote an <b>article</b> <b>entitled</b> King Plagiarism and His Court, interpreted as accusing Haggard of plagiarism for this. Thomson was so outraged at Haggard's alleged plagiarism that he published a novel of his own, Ulu: an African Romance, which, however, failed to sell.|$|E
25|$|In July, 2016, the Valparaiso University Law Review {{published}} an <b>article</b> <b>entitled</b> How Frank Easterbrook Kept George Ryan in Prison (Frank H. Easterbrook {{was one of}} Ryan’s judges, on the Seventh Circuit Appellate Court). The article (styled a “memoir”) was authored by Professor Albert Alschuler, one of Ryan’s appellate attorneys. It made serious accusations of judicial misconduct against Judge Easterbrook, constituting perhaps the most explosive attack against a federal judge ever heard. This remains a cause célèbre in the legal community, though formal judicial misconduct complaints have not (yet) been filed, nor judicial reforms (yet) instituted.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1970, Thompson {{wrote an}} <b>article</b> <b>entitled</b> The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for the {{short-lived}} new journalism magazine Scanlan's Monthly. Although {{it was not}} widely read, the article {{was the first to}} use the techniques of Gonzo journalism, a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic first-person subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook. Ralph Steadman, who would collaborate with Thompson on several more projects, contributed expressionist pen-and-ink illustrations.|$|E
