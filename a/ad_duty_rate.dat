While our predictions are general for any firms or products involved in U. S. AD cases, we examine both passthrough issues using monthly prices across 345 U. S. -imported Canadian {{iron and steel products}} from 1989 through 1995, some of which received duties in U. S. AD cases filed in 1992. We find that pass-through of AD duties is 160 percent for these products, while exchange rate pass-through rises dramatically after products receive AD duties, with no such change for closely-related products not subject to final AD duties. Both results are important in understanding that the effects of these AD cases go beyond that of the initial <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E

In light of increased concern about China's trade practices, the conference report on fiscal year 2004 appropriations requested that GAO review efforts by U.

40|$|Antidumping (<b>AD)</b> <b>duties</b> {{are often}} {{calculated}} as {{the difference between}} the foreign firm’s product price in its own market and its product price in the export market. Additionally, AD laws allow for recalculation of the <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> over time in what are known as the administrative review process. These features of AD policy imply that foreign firms that face AD trade protection must solve a dynamic pricing problem, and this has not been considered by previous literature. In response, this paper models the dynamic pricing problem of firms facing possible <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> and empirically examines some of the model’s implications. We characterize a firm’s optimal dynamic pricing paths under both certain and uncertain AD enforcement. Under certain enforcement of AD policy, a foreign firm choosing to dump in the initial period will dump more over time until the price reaches a steady state value. Thus, under this scenario <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> increase or stay constant over time in subsequent administrative reviews. However, a foreign firm may choose its initial period price with a positive probability for avoiding <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> (uncertain enforcement).

Second, we argue that <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> are more costly than simply the visible costs of AD protection. There are significant additional costs associated with the prospect of protection and these costs are imposed on both the domestic economy and on the international trading community.

40|$|US {{antidumping}} (AD) {{policy can}} generate anticipatory effects on firms subject to <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> {{because of a}} process called "administrative reviews" in which US government agencies determines refund rates based on exporters' most recent pricing behavior. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the anticipatory effects from importers' and exporters' side by examining the US-Canada softwood lumber disputes. Using a demand estimation technique, we find evidence of the importers' anticipation: importers were less sensitive to tariff <b>rates</b> under the <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> compared to standard tariffs, which indicates that the importers increased their volume of imports anticipating the future refund. We further show that the importers adjusted their anticipation adaptively, in the sense that the anticipated refund rate evolved according to the most recent revised <b>rate</b> of an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> released in the determination of an administrative review. On the other hand, using a pass-through regression, we find evidence of the exporters' anticipation: the pass-through of the <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> into export prices (boarder prices) is larger than that of standard tariffs by about 41 % after controlling for unobserved demand shocks. The result indicates that the exporters set their prices higher under the <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> in order to raise the future refund, which in turn increase their future profits through the evolution of the importers' anticipation. ...|$|R

This paper investigates the impact of granting market economy status to China on antidumping (<b>AD)</b> <b>duties</b> and imports. With regard to non-market economies (like China), it is presumed that prices and costs are influenced by state interference and, therefore, authorities use prices and costs from a third party economy to construct normal values. This, however, leads to higher dumping margins.

40|$|At the {{inception}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994, South Africa, as one of the founding members, embarked on a robust trade liberalisation policy. This was mainly achieved through the drastic reduction of tariffs across a number of industries. The agricultural sector was also subjected to this trade liberalisation, which left it open to international competition. As part of the WTO legal framework, the Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Anti-Dumping Agreement / ADA) was adopted and all the WTO members were bound by it. The ADA enables a WTO member to impose Anti-Dumping (<b>AD)</b> <b>duties</b> against imports that are being dumped on its domestic market by an exporter of another WTO Member State. In 1999, the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) petitioned the SA AD investigating authority, the Board on Tariffs and Trade (the Board), to impose <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> on certain USA poultry imports. The Board made use of the constructed NV method, sanctioned by WTO law, to determine NV which resulted in the imposition of final <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> against USA poultry imports on 9 December 2000. These <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> were so high that it effectively stopped the importation of USA poultry into the SA market. However, US Government, various interested parties, and scholars have since been very critical of the imposition of the December 2000 <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> imposed against USA poultry products. It has been argued that the Board egregiously calculated the costs of production of the poultry products, a step vital to the determination of dumping. According to the critics of these <b>AD</b> <b>duties,</b> the Board intentionally made use of the constructed NV method to manipulate cost in order to protect an inefficient and uncompetitive SA poultry industry. So, this study will seeks to test the merits of the argument that the Board?s determination of constructed NV was WTO inconsistent in its December 2000 AD decision against USA poultry products. In doing this, the author will analyse the Board?s decision and WTO Panel reports on the interpretation of Article 2. 2. 1. 1 of the ADA, which deals with the determination of constructed NV. tm 2017 Centre for Human RightsLLMUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} "echoing" in antidumping (AD) cases (i. e., different countries sequentially imposing AD measures on the same product from the same exporter). We develop a dynamic game in which two competing importers can choose to impose an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> on a third exporting country {{in one of two}} periods, if at all. Assuming that governments are politically motivated (favoring their import competing industries), we find that a country imposes an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> in the first (second) period independently of the other country’s actions if its political-economy parameter is "very high" ("high"). Instead, it never introduces AD measures when its political-economy parameter is below a critical "low" threshold. Echoing occurs for intermediate values of the political-economy parameter: a country chooses to impose an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> in the second period if and only if the competing importer has done so in the first period. Using a novel AD dataset, we document that echoing is a common practice among both traditional and new users of AD. In line with the conclusions of the theoretical model, the econometric results show that AD measures {{are more likely to be}} introduced in response to other countries’ measures when governments care to some extent, but not too much, about their import-competing industries.
