An old uncle of his died, and left him a few acres of land down in Essex; and he has saved a bit of money out of his pay, and his share of the prizes we have made; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> giving up the sea, and {{settling}} down on shore. So now, he will do it. He said as much as that, the night he was wounded.|$|E

But he was most interesting at the table," [...] continued Ethel, sublimely unconscious of the lack of compliment in the comparison; [...] "as Jim would say, he fairly wiped up the ground with father, and it isn't an easy thing to do." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{episode was}} one of those topsy-turvy {{mixtures}} of all places and ages which only this jumbled century of ours has witnessed; it impressed me deeply. Here was this Indian prince, a feudal Rajput chief, living practically among his vassals in the Middle Ages when at home in India; yet he said 'I am a Merton man,' as Harold himself might have said it; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> cricket as naturally as Lord Southminster talked about the noble quadruped. The oddest part of it all was, we alone felt the incongruity; to the Maharajah, the change from Moozuffernuggar to Oxford and from Oxford back again to Moozuffernuggar seemed perfectly natural. They were but two alternative phases in a modern Indian gentleman's education and experience.|$|E

O, Marian, he said dreadful things; I did not think Walter could have been so cruel. O, such things! He made me look at the Marriage Service, and say how I could answer those things; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> death and the Last Day.

60|$|When {{the lady}} was gone, Mr Rubb sat himself again {{down on the}} sofa, and there he {{remained}} for the next half-hour. He talked {{about the business of}} the firm, saying how it would now certainly be improved; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Tom Mackenzie's family, saying what a grand thing it was for Susanna to be thus taken in hand by her aunt; and he asked a question or two about Miss Baker, and then a question or two about Mr Maguire, during which questions he learned that Mr Maguire was not as yet a married man; and from Mr Maguire he got on to the Stumfolds, and learned somewhat of the rites and ceremonies of the Stumfoldian faith. In this way he prolonged his visit till Miss Mackenzie began to feel that he ought to take his leave.|$|E
60|$|The {{kings of}} England and France, young Richard, and many more, were roused {{to take the}} cross; but while {{arrangements}} for going were being made, a fresh dispute about them arose, and Richard went away in a rage, got his friends together, and, with King Philip of France to help him, began to make war. His father was feeble, and worn out, and could not resist as in former times. He fell ill, and gave up the struggle, saying he would grant all they asked. The list of Richard's friends whom he was to pardon was brought to him, and the first name he saw in it was that of John, his youngest son, and his darling, {{the one who had}} never before rebelled. That quite broke his heart, his illness grew worse, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> an old eagle being torn to pieces by his eaglets. And so, in the year 1189, Henry II. died the saddest death, perhaps, that an old man can die, for his sons had brought down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.|$|E

6000|$|And Thomas did his dogged best, the {{red light}} in his eye; though he had not, and never could have had, the {{smallest}} instinct for story-writing, he knew to the finger-tips how it is done; but for ever {{he would have gone}} on breaking all the rules of the game. How he wrestled with himself! Sublime thoughts came to him (nearly all about that girl), and he drove them away, for he knew they beat only against the march of his story, and, whatever befall, the story must march. Relentlessly he followed in the track of his men, pushing the dreary dogs on to deeds of valour. He tried making the lady human, and then she would not march; she sat still, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> her; he dumped her down, and soon he was yawning. This weariness was what alarmed him most, for well he understood that there could be no treasure where the work was not engrossing play, and he doubted no more than Pym that for him the treasure was in the tale or nowhere. Had he not been sharpening his tools in this belief for years? Strange to reflect now that all the time he was hacking and sweating at that novel (the last he ever attempted) it was only marching towards the waste-paper basket! ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the whole}} the {{atmosphere}} of the great conference was American, and yet I distinctly remember that it was the Special Train to Bâle of which he gave us an account one afternoon; it was a night journey of considerable eventfulness, with two adjacent carriages de luxe labelled respectively [...] "Specially Reserved for Miss Marie Corelli," [...] and [...] "Specially Reserved for Mr. and Mrs. George Bernard Shaw," [...] with conspicuous reiterations. The other compartments were less exclusive, and contained curious minglings of greatness, activity, and reputation. Sir J. M. Barrie had an upper berth in a wagon-lit, where he remained sympathetically silent above a crowd of younger reputations, a crowd too numerous to permit the making of the lower berth and overflowing into the corridor. I remember Boon kept jamming new people into that congestion. The whole train, indeed, was to be fearfully overcrowded. That was part of the joke. James Joyce I recall as a novelist strange to me that Boon insisted was a [...] "first-rater." [...] He represented him as being of immense size but extreme bashfulness. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> D. H. Lawrence, St. John Ervine, Reginald Wright Kauffman, Leonard Merrick, Viola Meynell, Rose Macaulay, Katherine Mansfield, Mary Austin, Clutton Brock, Robert Lynd, James Stephens, Philip Guedalla, H.

6000|$|September 29th.--Last evening I met Mr. Powers at Miss Blagden's, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> his treatment, by our {{government}} in reference, to an appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars made by Congress for a statue by him. Its payment and {{the purchase of}} the statue were left at the option of the President, and he conceived himself wronged because the affair was never concluded. [...] . As for the President, he knows nothing of art, and probably acted in the matter by the advice of the director of public works. No doubt a sculptor gets commissions as everybody gets public employment and emolument of whatever kind from {{our government}}, not by merit or fitness, but by political influence skilfully applied. As Powers himself observed, the ruins of our Capitol are not likely to afford sculptures equal to those which Lord Elgin took from the Parthenon, if this be the system under which they are produced. [...] . I wish our great Republic had the spirit to do as much, according to its vast means, as Florence did for sculpture and architecture when it was a republic; but we have the meanest government and the shabbiest, and--if truly represented by it--we are the meanest and shabbiest people known in history. And yet the less we attempt to do for art the better, if our future attempts are to have no better result than such brazen troopers as the equestrian statue of General Jackson, or even such naked respectabilities as Greenough's Washington. There is something false and affected in our highest taste for art; and I suppose, furthermore, we are the only people who seek to decorate their public institutions, not by the highest taste among them, but by the average at best.|$|E
