Although she {{spent much of her}} time in reserve, she had <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> role in the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. After her return home in 1924, the ship became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. In 1926 Centurion was converted into a target ship and participated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of aerial bombing in addition to her normal duties. During the Second World War, the ship was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. When that operation was cancelled, she was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E

He scored the winning goal against league rivals Manchester United which set his team on their way to securing the Premier League title and opened the scoring against Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final. In 2000, he moved to Barcelona in a deal worth £25million and became the most expensive player in Dutch football history.

5|$|In March, the pro-German Yugoslav {{government}} was toppled. A furious Hitler ordered the attack to {{be expanded to}} include Yugoslavia. Operation Marita commenced on 7 April. The Luftwaffe committed StG 1, 2 and 77 to the campaign. The Stuka once again spearheaded the air assault, with a front line strength of 300 machines, against minimal Yugoslav resistance in the air, allowing the Stukas to develop a fearsome reputation in this region. Operating unmolested, they took a heavy toll of ground forces, suffering only light losses to ground fire. The effectiveness of the dive bombers helped bring about Yugoslav capitulation in just ten days. The Stukas also took <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> part in Operation Punishment, Hitler's retribution bombing of Belgrade. The dive bombers were to attack airfields and anti-aircraft gun positions whilst the level bombers struck civilian targets.

5|$|In late September, a {{tropical}} wave persisted {{in the northeastern}} Atlantic Ocean. The low-pressure area later became sufficiently organized to be classified as {{a tropical}} storm at 0000 UTC on September 22. The disturbance quickly organized after tropical cyclogenesis, and reached a strength equivalent to a modern-day Category 1 hurricane strength at 1800 UTC later that day. The American steamship Otho encountered the system that day, and reported gale force winds in conjunction with <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> barometric pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.42 inHg). The tropical cyclone continued to the east-northeast, where it gradually intensified. At 1200 UTC on September 23, the hurricane attained modern-day Category 2 hurricane intensity with winds of 100 mbar (155 km/h); a peak which would be maintained {{for at least the}} following 12 hours. A second steamship, the Lobito, reported hurricane-force winds along with a minimum pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg); this would be the lowest pressure measured associated with the tropical cyclone. After reaching peak intensity, the hurricane began a weakening trend, and degenerated to a Category 1 hurricane at 0600 UTC as it passed over the Azores. The following day, the hurricane recurved westward, where it weakened before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 28. This remnant system subsequently dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, a weak {{low-pressure}} {{area was}} detected south of Hispaniola. Moving northward, the low became sufficiently organized {{to be classified}} as a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on May 19, southeast of Turks Island. At the time, ship observations indicated that the disturbance had a well-defined cyclonic circulation, with the strongest winds situated in the northern semicircle of the cyclone. Continuing northward, the tropical storm gradually intensified and attained maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) by 0000 UTC on May 22. The Belgian ship M.S. Lubrafol recorded <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> barometric pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.42 inHg); this was the lowest pressure measured {{in connection with the}} storm. The following day, the tropical storm temporarily curved towards the east-southeast before recurving back towards a northeast direction. At the same time, the storm expanded in size and began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. By 1200 UTC, the cyclone completed its extratropical transition, due to the entrainment of colder air. The remnant system persisted until 0600 UTC on May 27.|$|E
5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H.

The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and {{the one or two}} players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia {{to go along with the}} games, and <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E

5|$|Their {{first such}} {{expedition}} {{took place on}} October 3, 1862, about {{two weeks after the}} regiment reached Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts formed <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> part of the Expedition against Franklin, a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near Western Branch Church, far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets {{for the first time in}} action. Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle made a strong impression on the new recruits. During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near Zuni, Virginia and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment—2nd Lieutenant Robert G. Barr. The regiment did not again leave Suffolk until an expedition on January 29, 1863, again towards the Blackwater River. Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the Battle of Deserted House in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts was sharply engaged and lost five killed and seven wounded.|$|E
5|$|After penning {{a number}} of radio and TV scripts, {{including}} episodes of Crossroads and Waggoner's Walk, Barbara Clegg submitted a story idea to Doctor Who script editor Eric Saward, an acquaintance from the BBC drama department. Interested in writing for the series, Clegg had been inspired when distant relatives had stayed with her and demanded constant entertainment during their visit, basing {{the character of the}} Eternals upon them. Initially titled The Enlighteners, her submission involved ships racing through space that, with the addition of the Black Guardian sub-plot, eventually evolved into the story as screened. Saward and series producer John Nathan-Turner liked Clegg's ideas, and they commissioned the script in September 1981. The first episode was delivered by Clegg in October and the three following episodes arriving in January 1982. The serial was now scheduled to conclude a three-story trilogy featuring the Black Guardian, and Clegg duly wrote the recurring characters into her scripts. By May 1982 there were problems with a script by Pat Mills, Song of the Space Whale, which had been intended to open the Black Guardian trilogy. Mills' script was eventually dropped and the production team considered moving The Enlighteners forward in the season to replace it, necessitating considerable re-wites. Peter Grimwade was eventually commissioned to write Mawdryn Undead to replace The Song of the Space Whale, and The Enlighteners was confirmed as the fifth serial of the season. The first draft of Part One did not contain any of the material concerning the Guardians, and Turlough was <b>a</b> <b>peripheral</b> figure, with the script focussing on the relationship between Marriner and Tegan. With pre-production underway, Saward changed the story title to Enlightenment in September 1982, a title he felt was more enigmatic. Saward also rewrote portions of the script pertaining to the story-arc, particularly the final confrontation scenes at the end of Part Four. Peter Moffatt had been originally scheduled as the serials director, but following the problems with the Space Whale script he was asked to helm its replacement due to his experience, and so Fiona Cumming was asked to take over Enlightenment.|$|E
