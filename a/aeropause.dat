Important fields necessary for research that involves the <b>aeropause</b> include aviation medicine, geophysics, astronomy, astrophysics, aeronautical engineering, biophysics, and radiobiology.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} when the term <b>aeropause</b> became {{relevant}} to the pursuits of mankind into the upper regions of Earthâ€™s atmosphere, there did not exist a precise description for the word. The judgement of experts in the various fields was solicited and input was sought to define the term <b>aeropause.</b> The terms from aeromedical and aeronautical disciplines along with terms from geophysics, astrophysics, and radiobiology were not sufficient to depict this region of the atmosphere where human endeavors sought to venture and explore. The current terms in use were limited and insufficient. The terms available and that came under consideration were aerosphere, <b>aeropause,</b> and astronautics.According to Clayton S. White, the expression <b>aeropause</b> is a coined word first spoken by Dr. Konrad Buettner of the Department of Space Medicine at Randolph Field during a conference. Again, referring to White: [...] "aerosphere was visualized as that region in which flight was possible currently. The <b>aeropause</b> was the region just above this, to be different yesterday, today, and tomorrow, as progress in aviation ensued".|$|E

5000|$|Heinz Haber, Department of Space Medicine at Randolph Field, {{an expert}} in space {{medicine}} sought a more functional definition and said the: [...] "aeropause should be defined as that region in which the functional effects of the atmosphere on man and craft begin to cease". The aeronautical engineer defined the <b>aeropause</b> as those areas of the atmosphere where the physiological necessities of the aircrew became the limiting factors {{for the design of}} aircraft and supporting equipment.|$|E
