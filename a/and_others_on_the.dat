5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} {{tried to}} stop, or limit, {{the changes in}} the ČSSR through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at Čierna nad Tisou, near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, with attendance of Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin, Nikolai Podgorny, Mikhail Suslov <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Soviet side and Dubček, Svoboda, Oldřich Černík, Smrkovský <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Czechoslovak side, Dubček defended the proposals of the reformist wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Josef Smrkovský, Oldřich Černík, and František Kriegel) who supported Dubček, and conservatives (Vasil Biľak, Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka) who adopted an anti-reformist stance.|$|E
5|$|A {{team from}} Argonne {{was on hand}} for {{powering}} up the first reactor at the Hanford Site, where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs. They watched the reactor in shifts, with John Marshall <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day shift, Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift, ending at midnight, and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift. While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.|$|E
5|$|By 1821, Stratford {{was served}} {{by a number of}} wharves, some located on the Lea <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Channelsea River or other branches. In {{addition}} to wharves for general goods, some specifically handled timber, chalk, stone, coal, or wheat. Several of the factories and mills had private wharves. By this date, a dock had been built near Bow Bridge to the south of the High Street. It was about , and was connected to the river by its own channel. It was initially called Stratford Dock, later becoming Meggs Dock and was probably constructed by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust. Half of it had been filled in by 1896, and the rest by 1920.|$|E

5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as they no longer had access to the fuel supplies in their compound and at least initially they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> USS Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1548, the galleys {{returned}} to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now {{at its lowest}} point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of {{the place where he}} first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} native ethnic groups within Song China {{that did not}} belong to the Han Chinese majority. This {{included}} the Yao people, who staged tribal uprisings against the Song in Guangdong in 1035 and Hunan in 1043, during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song (r. 1023–1064). Song authorities employed Zhuang people as local officials in what is now Guangxi and Guangdong, where the Song placed them in charge of distributing land to the Yao and other tribal groups. The Yao peoples <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> empire's frontier were incorporated into a feudal system, or fengjian shehui, which Ralph A. Litzinger says bypassed any possible native development of a primitive slave society, or nuli shehui, since the Yao and others lacked a sedentary tradition. Although mainland Chinese states made efforts to settle parts of Hainan Island since the 3rd century BC, {{it was not until the}} Song that a concerted effort was made to assimilate the Li people of its highlands, who at times had fought against and repelled Han Chinese settlers. During the 11th century, the Man people of Hainan wreaked havoc by joining bandit gangs of ten to several hundred men. The statesman Ouyang Xiu estimated in 1043 that there were at least several thousand Man bandits residing in a dozen or so prefectures of mainland China.|$|E

25|$|Harder {{forms of}} Christian music, such as heavy metal, {{also began to}} gain acceptance.

While in 1981 total gospel music industry revenues were approximately $180million, only ten years later they would total $680million, according to CCM Magazine.|$|E

Tourism contributes to the economy of Agra. Agra is home to Asia’s largest spa called Kaya Kalp – The Royal Spa, at the Hotel Mughal in Agra.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary.

The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a crank and connecting rod to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.|$|E
