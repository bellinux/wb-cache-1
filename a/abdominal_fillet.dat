40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} carcass yield of surubins Pseudoplatystoma spp. reared in ponds under different stocking densities. We performed a completely randomized design, with three treatments (density) and nine repetitions. The densities were: density 1 (1 peixe/ 5 m 2), density 2 (1 fish/ 3 m 2) and 3 density (1 fish/ 2. 14 m 2). Surubins total average weight of 1. 144 Â± 0. 340 kg, were slaughtered by thermal shock in ice for determining yields of eviscerated fish with and no head (YEFWH; YEFWNH), the lateral fillet with and with no skin (YLFWS; YLFWNS) of <b>abdominal</b> <b>fillet</b> with and with no skin (YAFWS; YAFWNS), head (YH), skin (YS), viscera (YV) of residues (YR). Data were subjected to analysis of variance and average was compared by Tukey test at 5...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the morphometric characteristics, the yield and the centesimal composition of different cuts of the Barbado's (Pinirampus pirinampu) flesh, captured in the Itaipu Reservoir. Were used 55 animals randomly distributed into three classes of body weight [less than 620 g (n = 15), between 620 and 1. 120 g (n = 16) and greater than de 1. 120 g (n = 24) ]. Were measured the standard length (SL), the total length (TL), the head length (HL), the head height (HH), the trunk length (TRL), the trunk height (TH) and width of the trunk (WT). Then were established the morphometric relationships: (HL/SL), (HL/HH), (SL/TL), (WT/TRL), (WT/TH) (TH/TRL). Afterwards were measured the flesh's cut yield and the residue waste yield called: trunk (TC), fillet (FILLET), <b>abdominal</b> <b>fillet</b> (AF), head (HEAD), viscera (VISC), fin, spine and skin (SKSF). The levels of moisture, ash, fat and crude protein from FILLET and AF were determined. The body weight affected (P< 0. 05) the WT/TRL, WT/TH, TH/TRL, TR, FILLET, HEAD and SKSF, however didn't affected the centesimal parameters. In conclusion, the Barbado (Pinirampus pirinampu) has allometric growth and the flesh processing from fishes with more than 620 g provides better yields of edible parts. In addition, the chemical composition of meat suggests its potential {{for use in the}} manufacture of artisanal or industrial products...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{evaluate}} the effect of slaughter weight and sex on processing yield and on the proximate composition of Rhamdia voulezi. We calculated the percentage yield of the whole fish (carcass, clean trunk, <b>abdominal</b> muscle, <b>fillet,</b> edible parts, head, skin, gonads and visceral fat yield). There was no statistical difference in yields among weight classes (P> 0. 05). However, when assessing the income between sexes we observed significant difference (P 0. 05) among the classes, however, moisture, lipids and calories had significant difference (P< 0. 05) among the classes, and humidity decreased with increasing size of the fish, and lipid content and calorific value were higher for fish weighing 301 - 400 g. We oncluded R. voulezi with mass between 100 and 400 g presents equal yield processing, and fish weighing 301 - 400 g have higher lipid content in the fillet. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of weight (W) {{category of the}} rainbow trout on processing yield and chemical composition of the entire eviscerated fish and fish fillet was analyzed. A completely randomized design was employed for processing variables (W 1 = 300 to 370 g and W 2 = 371 to 440) coupled to a 2 x 2 factorial scheme for the chemical composition (W 1 and W 2 and forms of presentation: fillet and whole eviscerated fish). W 1 showed higher yield for entire eviscerated fish (83. 00 %) and head (13. 27 %), but a lower yield for the viscera (17. 00 %), when compared to W 2. We did not affect <b>abdominal</b> muscle yield, <b>fillet</b> with or without skin, skin percentage and residues. There were significant differences between W for moisture (W 1 = 72. 30 % and W 2 = 71. 15 %) and lipids (CP 1 = 7. 96 % and CP 2 = 9. 04 %) rates. Fillet moisture contents (73. 74 %) and crude protein (19. 05 %) were higher (p < 0. 01) than for entire eviscerated fish (69. 71 % and 17. 81 %, respectively). Ash (2. 15 %) and lipid (10. 48 %) rates were higher (p < 0. 01) for entire fish when compared to those of fillets (1. 16 % and 6. 52 %, respectively). The slaughter of fish weighing between 300 and 370 g and their fillets are more adequate for the market. ...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{appearance}} {{is an essential}} quality property of food products. For salmonids the red color of the flesh is a main characteristic noticed by consumers, and fillets with discolored patches are downgraded. During recent years, dark melanin pigmentation has achieved great attention. In particular dark fillet spots are a costly problem for the salmon industry as such fillets cannot be sold as high quality products. The main goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of vaccination and dietary supplementation of zinc or vitamin E on appearance of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), starting before vaccination in freshwater (March 2013) until the fish reached 1. 9 kg in seawater (March 2014). The focus was on melanin deposition in abdominal organs, <b>abdominal</b> wall and <b>fillets.</b> Also overall fillet and liver coloration, occurrence of gaping and body conformation were evaluated additionally. Organ adhesions and the relative weight development of viscera, muscle, liver and heart were monitored throughout the experiment. The results showed that changes in melanin deposition differed between the tissues studied, with increasing incidence in fillets showing the clearest development. Melanin deposits were consistently higher in organs (significant) and abdominal peritoneum (numerically) of vaccinated compared with unvaccinated salmon. At the final sampling, the melanin score in fillets was significantly higher in the vaccinated (23 % of the fillets) than unvaccinated salmon (10 % of the fillets). Vaccinated fish also had higher scores for organ adhesions, smaller hearts during the early seawater phase (Sept-Dec), paler livers and higher liver% (HIS) immediately after vaccination, and larger livers at the final sampling, paler fillets but less gaping immediately after sea transfer. Compared with the control feed, dietary Zn supplementation resulted in higher fillet yield in December but lower yield in March, higher melanin score in organs and less adhesions in the early seawater phase, less visceral fat in December but higher in March, darker liver color, except immediately after vaccination.
