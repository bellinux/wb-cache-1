5|$|The {{purchases}} of the diaries continued throughout {{mid to late}} 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81millionDMs {{since the start of}} the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an <b>authorisation</b> for a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he signed a further <b>authorisation</b> for 600,000DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of the diaries had now risen to 200,000DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.|$|E
40|$|M (Environmental Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This {{dissertation}} critically {{reviews the}} quality of South African environmental <b>authorisations</b> {{through the application of}} a methodology adopted from the Lee and Colley (1999) environmental impact assessment (EIA) report review package. The literature review shows that to date limited research has been conducted on {{the quality of}} environmental <b>authorisations</b> nationally. Anecdotal evidence suggests that environmental <b>authorisations</b> are of weak quality; hence the development of guidelines on the compilation of environmental <b>authorisations</b> by the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). In this dissertation, the quality of the environmental <b>authorisations</b> is critically reviewed against the requirements of the National Environmental Management Act (Act No. 107 of 1998) and departmental guidelines. The research concludes that only 64 % of reviewed <b>authorisations</b> are deemed satisfactory, while 36 % were unsatisfactory. When the basic assessment report (BAR) and scoping and environmental impact assessment (S&EIA) process <b>authorisations</b> are compared it is concluded that the there is a minimal difference in quality. The BAR achieved a 69 % satisfactory rating while the S&EIA process achieved a 61 % satisfactory rating. The dissertation concludes by making recommendations {{to improve the quality of}} <b>authorisations.</b> Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Mining is {{essential}} to the human well-being in many aspects. Mining activities, however, contribute significantly to pollution and other environmental impacts in South Africa. Recently much more stringent environmental legislation has been developed in South Africa due to increased public awareness and environmental disasters caused by mining activities. <b>Authorisations</b> constitute one of the main "command and control" instruments {{that can be used to}} influence and direct the behaviour of individuals and organisations to achieve sound environmental protection ultimately. The problem is that in the ever-changing maze of South African environmental legislation, it is often difficult for individuals and organisations to identify, obtain and maintain environmental <b>authorisations.</b> This article provides a legislative framework for the mining sector, explores the purpose and importance of environmental <b>authorisations,</b> gives an overview of the underlying relationship between environmental <b>authorisations,</b> risk assessment and environmental management systems before proposing a generic procedure for identifying, obtaining and maintaining environmental <b>authorisations.</b> Master...|$|R

5|$|In 1532, Pedro de Alvarado, {{governor}} of Guatemala, was issued with royal <b>authorisation</b> {{to conquer the}} general area of Higueras, {{in order to establish}} a Caribbean port for Guatemala. Less than a year after permission was given to Alvarado, then {{governor of}} Honduras and Higueras, Diego Alvítez, was given royal <b>authorisation</b> to pacify and colonise the Naco valley and the area around Puerto de Caballos. Soon afterwards, in 1533, Francisco de Montejo, governor of Yucatán, was granted governorship over a huge area extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ulúa River, Naco and Puerto de Caballos, so long as neither Alvarado nor Alvítez had established themselves in those regions. At the same time, Alvardo received reconfirmation of his permission to conquer those parts of Higueras that had not been pacified by the governors of Yucatán and Honduras-Higueras. Effectively, all three governors had royal permission to conquer and settle the same general region, and could interpret the royal authorisations as they chose.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for <b>authorisation</b> to open a formal investigation on 26 November. The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this <b>authorisation</b> on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament {{represents}} {{the citizens of}} the Republic of Croatia; it acts as the country's legislature. It convenes regularly in two sessions each year, from 15 January to 15 July and from 15 September to 15 December; however, extraordinary sessions may be called by the President of Croatia, the Croatian Government or a majority of the parliamentary members. The sessions are open to the public. The parliament decides through simple majority votes, except in issues pertaining to (constitutionally recognised) ethnic minorities in Croatia, the constitution, electoral legislation, the scope and operational methods of governmental bodies and local government; in these cases, decisions are made by two-thirds majority votes. The parliament may authorise the government to enact regulations dealing with matters normally covered by parliamentary acts. Such regulations expire one year after the <b>authorisation</b> is issued. The <b>authorisation</b> does not apply to matters that must be decided upon by a parliamentary two-thirds vote. Legislation enacted by the parliament is either endorsed by the President of Croatia within eight days or referred to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia.|$|E

Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E

However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without <b>authorisation</b> from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E

This <b>authorisation</b> was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously been able to do so.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF <b>authorisation</b> officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the <b>authorisation</b> officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|E
