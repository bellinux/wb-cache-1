40|$|The present work compares {{volatile}} aroma components {{identified in}} dry base <b>wines,</b> young <b>Aszú</b> <b>wines</b> and noble rotted (aszú) grape berries from Tokaj wine district in Hungary. Volatile components {{were determined by}} GC-MS, for sample preparation liquid-liquid extraction was used. The greatest differences between the volatile components of Aszú and dry base wines were found in monoterpene alcohols, hydroxy-, oxo- and dicarboxylic acid esters and lactones. <b>Aszú</b> <b>wines</b> contained lower relative amounts of terpene alcohols, while hydroxy-, oxo- and dicarboxylic acid ester and lactone concentrations were found higher. Some lactones detected only in the <b>Aszú</b> <b>wines</b> {{were found in the}} noble rotted grape berries, too, so these compounds can {{play an important role in}} the unique and characteristic Aszú aroma. ...|$|R
50|$|Tarcal is {{probably}} the best grape-growing locale of the world famous Tokaj-Hegyalja wine district. All the traditional Tokaji grape varieties (Furmint, Hárslevelű, Sárga Muskotály (Yellow muscat) grown here dry well on the vine, so they are suitable for excellent vintage wines, special quality Szamorodni wines, and 3-to-6 Puttonyos Tokaji <b>aszú</b> <b>wines.</b> These wines are seasoned in oakwood casks in cellars covered with choice mould (racodium cellare, a noble cellar mould).|$|R
50|$|From the 2013 {{harvest the}} new {{regulation}} requires minimum 120 g/l residual sugar in every <b>Aszú</b> <b>wines.</b> The producer still {{may use the}} puttonyos number on the label.The ageing criteria has also changed from minimum 2 years barrel and 1 year bottle ageing to minimum 18 months barrel ageing.|$|R

50|$|Furmint {{accounts}} for 60% {{of the area}} and {{is by far the}} most important grape in the production of <b>Aszú</b> <b>wines.</b> Hárslevelű stands for further 30%. Nevertheless, an impressive range of different types and styles of wines are produced in the region, ranging from dry whites to the Eszencia, the world's sweetest wine.|$|R
5000|$|Other sweet wines: In {{the past}} few years reductive sweet wines have begun to appear in Tokaj. These are ready for release a year to 18 months after harvest. They {{typically}} contain 50-180 g/l of residual sugar and a ratio of botrytised berries comparable to <b>Aszú</b> <b>wines.</b> They are usually labeled as késői szüretelésű (late harvest) wines. Innovative producers have also marketed tokaji wine that does not fit the appellation laws of the above categories but is often of high quality and price, and in many ways comparable to <b>aszú.</b> These <b>wines</b> are often labeled as tokaji cuvée.|$|R
50|$|Kövérszőlő is {{a variety}} of grape {{indigenous}} to the Transylvania wine region, but is also grown in Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region of Hungary. The variety almost entirely disappeared from Tokaj after the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century. Kövérszőlő (fat grape) is characterized by its relatively large big berries. It is suitable for making <b>aszú</b> <b>wines</b> because of its susceptibility to botrytisation and its high sugar content.|$|R
5000|$|Once, törkölypálinka {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} produced types of pálinka. In the 1950, for example, 30% of all the pálinka produced was törkölypálinka, but the share of this type of pálinka has become smaller since then. A grape distillate from tokaji aszú has been produced since the 1960s. It is a blend of flavours resembling Italian grape distillates and of the aromas of <b>aszú</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tokaji wine {{became an}} {{increasingly}} important commodity for the region from the 17th century, its export being {{a major source of}} income for the ruling princes of Transylvania to which the Tokaj region belonged at the time. Indeed, revenues from the increasingly renowned Tokaji <b>Aszú</b> <b>wine</b> helped to pay for the wars of independence fought against Austrian Habsburg rule. The repute of Tokaji wine was enhanced when in 1703, Francis II Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania, gave King Louis XIV of France a gift of numerous bottles of wine from his Tokaj estate. Tokaji wine was then served at the Versailles Court, where it became known under the name of Tokay. Delighted with the precious beverage, Louis XIV declared it [...] "Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum" [...] ("Wine of Kings, King of Wines").|$|E
40|$|Tokaji Aszú is {{traditionally}} fermented by the indigenous yeast biota, which {{is different from}} that of normal wines. Numerous native strains of the most important species, S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus (partially reclassified as S. uvarum), as well as Candida stellata and C. zemplinina were tested for technological traits under the same conditions. The most important conclusions of this work are as follows. • Local Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. bayanus strains isolated from the indigenous yeast biota of Tokaji Aszú have considerable diversity in oenological properties. • S. cerevisiae strains grow and ferment aszú wines better than S. bayanus strains. The two species have different impact on the chemical composition of wine, both of them having positive and negative features in comparison. A combined use of the two species should be investigated. • The typical non-Saccharomyces species of Tokaji Aszú, as single cultures, generally could not ferment the <b>aszú</b> <b>wine</b> properly. • The most important non-Saccharomyces species, C. stellata and C. zemplinina are very similar from oenological aspects. They are highly fructophylic producing high glucose and fructose ratio (1. 4 - 2. 7) in the <b>aszú</b> <b>wine</b> after fermentation. These highly fructophylic species may alter the normally low (close to 0. 5) glucose and fructose ratio in the <b>aszú</b> <b>wine,</b> if Saccharomyces strains fail to grow up during spontaneous fermentation, which may cause problems in the official origin control of Tokaji Aszú...|$|E
5000|$|Eszencia: Also called nectar, this {{is often}} {{described}} {{as one of the most}} exclusive wines in the world, although technically it cannot even be called a wine because its enormous concentration of sugar means that its alcohol level never rises above 5-6 degrees. Eszencia is the juice of aszú berries which runs off naturally from the vats in which they are collected during harvesting. The sugar concentration of eszencia is typically between 500 g and 700 g per litre, although the year 2000 vintage produced eszencia exceeding 900 g per liter. Eszencia is traditionally added to <b>aszú</b> <b>wines,</b> but may be allowed to ferment (a process that takes at least 4 years to complete) and then bottled pure. The resulting wine has a concentration and intensity of flavor that is unequaled, but is so sweet that it can only be drunk in small quantities. Unlike virtually all other wines, Eszencia maintains its quality and drinkability when stored for 200 years or more.|$|R
5000|$|Historically Tokaji was a {{white wine}} from the region of Tokaj in the Kingdom of Hungary. Tokaji wine was {{mentioned}} as early as 1635 {{with reference to the}} sweet dessert <b>aszú</b> (botrytised) <b>wine.</b> Prior to the phylloxera epidemic in the 1880s, wine was grown in Tokaj from various types of mainly white grape varieties. In English and French the spelling [...] "Tokay" [...] was commonly used.|$|R
50|$|According to Hungarian legend {{the first}} <b>aszú</b> (a <b>wine</b> using botrytised grapes) {{was made by}} Laczkó Máté Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from botrytised grapes had already {{appeared}} in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Balázs Sziksai, which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of aszú predates this reference by five years. When vineyard classification began in 1730 in the Tokaj region, one of the gradings given to the various terroirs centered on their potential to develop Botrytis cinerea.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the role of}} {{different}} yeast strains {{in the production of}} volatile flavour components of Tokaji <b>Aszú</b> <b>wine</b> was tested. The effect of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter and that of the typical endogenous Candida stellata strain as well as spontaneous fermentation were studied and compared. For the fast comparison of aroma profile, a solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling and a GC-MS separation and identification were used. Thirty of the present compounds were selected to characterise the changes of flavour. Significant differences were found between wines fermented with different yeast strains. Application of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter alone accelerated the fermentation but this caused only little change in the aroma profile and content. Candida stellata contributed weakly to the production of aroma, especially to that of the longer carbon chain ethyl esters. Characteristic compounds of aged wine were detected in bottle aged Tokaji Aszú. The change of aroma profile as a function of bottle storage time was studied. The concentrations of vitispirane, trimethyl dihydronaphtalene, 2 -phenylethanol and diethyl succinate increased in the course of ageing time, while those of 3 -methyl-butyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate decreased...|$|E
2500|$|Furmint can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} styles ranging from bone dry to extremely sweet wines afflicted by noble rot. The grape has the potential to produce wines with naturally high levels of acidity with complex flavors derived from phenolic compounds in the juice and through brief contact with the grape skins. Furmint wines, particularly the botrytized dessert wines, can have immense aging potential with some well made examples from favorable vintages continuing to age for over a century. These wines, described by wine expert Oz Clarke as nearly [...] "immortal", are most often the <b>aszú</b> style <b>wines</b> of Tokaji made from the top 10-15% of Furmint harvested. This potential comes from the balance of acidity and high levels of sugars in the wine which act as preservatives during the aging process.|$|R
50|$|The {{concentration}} of aszú was traditionally {{defined by the}} number of puttony of dough added to a Gönc cask (136 liter barrel) of must. Nowadays the puttony number is based on the content of sugar and sugar-free extract in the mature <b>wine.</b> <b>Aszú</b> ranges from 3 puttonyos to 6 puttonyos, with a further category called Aszú-Eszencia representing wines above 6 puttonyos. Unlike most other wines, alcohol content of aszú typically runs higher than 14%. Annual production of aszú is {{less than one percent of}} the region's total output.|$|R
