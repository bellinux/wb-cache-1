25|$|Freemasonry in <b>Adair</b> <b>County,</b> Missouri {{dates back}} {{prior to the}} American Civil War, with the first lodge, Kirksville Lodge No. 128, {{chartered}} in May, 1850. Following the war {{a large number of}} various Masonic lodges and affiliated organizations flourished within the county and at its height the combined membership county-wide totaled over three thousand members. There proved a need and great desire for one central meeting point large enough for all activities instead of the scattered rental facilities then in use, so in 1919 the Masonic Temple Association was formed, a building site chosen, and fundraising efforts begun. Two wealthy local Osteopathic physicians, Doctors George M. Laughlin and Harry M. Still, both Masons, provided the bulk of the financing for the project, with the issuing of bonds covering the rest.|$|E

As a junior at <b>Adair</b> <b>County</b> High School, he received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis from Congressman Ralph Gilbert, to begin in 1925. However, Gilbert revoked the appointment after traveling to the Far East that summer on a Navy cruiser and being appalled by what he considered to be excessive drinking by the ship's officers during port calls. Instead, Gilbert substituted an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point for the following year. Hamlett spent the intervening year at Lindsey Wilson Junior College and entered the Military Academy on July 1, 1926, where he roomed with future four-star general Hamilton H. Howze.

Frame homes were damaged or destroyed, vehicles were tossed and damaged, numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and mobile homes were obliterated with debris and insulation strewn long distances downwind.

As {{a result of the}} tornado, a major fire occurred as a natural gas plant was ripped apart by the tornado in the southwestern portion of the county. The area was evacuated and no one was injured at the plant. Two people were killed at a home along U.S. Route 231, and five other people were injured in the county. Crossing into Macon County, the tornado regained EF3 intensity as it struck the western and northern sections of Lafayette, resulting in widespread, major destruction in the area. Numerous homes and several churches were destroyed in Lafeyette, with several leveled to the ground. An auto sales business in town sustained heavy damage as well. Surveyors observed major damage to a large, expensive brick home that was built unanchored on a very weak, unreinforced cinder block foundation. The house shifted off the foundation during the tornado, causing walls to buckle and collapse. 170 homes were destroyed, and 9 homes had major damage in the Lafeyette area. 13 people were killed in and around town, and 44 others were injured. President George W. Bush toured the Macon County destruction on February 8 and promised relief to individuals.

In 1942 a paved all-weather landing strip, hangars, a control tower and small restaurant were built; the paved runway was 3870 ft until 1968.|$|R
