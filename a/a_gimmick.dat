5|$|The Screaming Skulls opening {{disclaimer}} that a free burial {{would be}} provided to anybody who died of fright while watching the film was inspired by <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> {{that had been used}} by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, Nicol did not actually contact an insurance company.|$|E

5|$|They {{first began}} teaming {{together}} in 2007. Originally rivals, John Morrison and The Miz became partners {{as a result}} of winning the WWE Tag Team Championship and making the title exclusive to the ECW brand, for a brief time. They eventually dropped the title in July 2008. During their title reign, Morrison and The Miz developed <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> that resulted in the duo being given their own webshow, The Dirt Sheet, and their own in-ring interview segment of the same name on ECW. In December 2008 they won the Slammy Award in the category for Tag Team of the Year and won the World Tag Team Championship.

5|$|After regaining the championship, the Acolytes began another {{feud with}} Kane with various partners. On the August 8, 1999 edition of Sunday Night Heat, Kane {{teamed up with}} Road Dogg to face the Acolytes for the WWF Tag Team Championship, in a losing effort. The {{following}} night on Raw, Kane then teamed up with X-Pac to face the Acolytes in another Championship match, where X-Pac delivered a X-Factor to Faarooq into the pinfall, which meant that the Acolytes lost the title. The following week, they lost a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After losing their rematch, they won a number one contendership for the WWF Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam, where they won a Tag Team Turmoil match. They were unable to regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, as their match against The Big Show and The Undertaker went to a no-contest. After this, they began a feud with the Dudley Boyz, which ended at Unforgiven where they defeated the Dudley Boyz. After their feud with the Dudley Boyz, the Acolytes began <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> as card players and beer drinkers, where they hustled many WWF superstars/employees out of their money.|$|E

5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E
25|$|Answers in Genesis {{dismissed}} the challenge as <b>a</b> <b>gimmick.</b> A 2005 challenge on Boing Boing offered $250,000 {{to anyone who}} could prove that the Flying Spaghetti Monster (the deity of a parody religion constructed {{to make a point}} about giving time to alternative views on evolution) was not the father of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Path√© gave Morse the {{opportunity}} to indulge in a level of experimentation, not only by recording her own songs, but also through {{the opportunity}} to explore the limits of her vocal abilities. Prevalent on these early recordings are her characteristic whoops, yips and yodels. Although dismissed by some as <b>a</b> <b>gimmick,</b> these techniques added a personality to her voice and enabled her to fully demonstrate her multi-octave range.|$|E

25|$|In JCP, Fernandez was paired up with Jody Hamilton, who {{had been}} wrestling as the Masked Assassin; Fernandez became the Masked Assassin 2, <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> that had been played by several other wrestlers over the years. The two competed at the first ever Starrcade beating the team of Rufus R. Jones and Bugsy McGraw. Fernandez's run {{as one of the}} Assassins ended less than a year later, after he was unmasked by Jimmy Valiant.|$|E
25|$|Leading up {{to their}} match at No Mercy, Jeff Jarrett would taunt Chyna and hit her with random {{household}} objects. He also began <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> where he would degrade women, which involved him attacking female WWF employees. At Rebellion, Jarrett defeated Chyna after hitting her {{in the head with}} a guitar when the referee was not looking. During this time, Jarrett also introduced Miss Kitty to be the valet for his manager Debra.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 {{match on}} Sunday Night Heat, Gunn was {{defeated}} by Chuck Palumbo, who recently left The Alliance to join the WWF. After the match, Gunn suggested that they form a tag team. Palumbo agreed, and Billy and Chuck quickly rose {{to the top of}} the tag team division. Initially they were a generic face tandem, but soon turned heel when they were given <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> where they grew increasingly affectionate toward each other, showing evidence of a storyline homosexual relationship.|$|E

25|$|Instruments made {{mostly from}} plastic {{emerged in the}} 2010s as a cheaper and more robust {{alternative}} to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour. The sound plastic instruments produce {{is different from the}} one of brass, lacquer, gold or silver. While originally seen as <b>a</b> <b>gimmick,</b> these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Ailes had a {{spirited}} discussion about television in politics {{with one of}} the show's guests, Richard Nixon, who took the view that television was <b>a</b> <b>gimmick.</b> Later, Nixon called on Ailes to serve as his Executive Producer for television. Nixon's successful presidential campaign was Ailes's first venture into the political spotlight. His pioneering work in framing national campaign issues, capitalizing on the race-based Southern Strategy and making the stiff Nixon more likable and accessible to voters was later chronicled in The Selling of the President 1968 by Joe McGinniss.|$|E
25|$|In Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, a 1998 {{documentary}} {{included on}} some DVD {{editions of the}} first Blues Brothers film, Cropper noted {{that some of his}} peers thought that he and the other musicians backing the Blues Brothers were selling out to Hollywood or using <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> to make some quick money. Cropper responded by stating that he thought Belushi was as good as (or even better than) many of the singers he had backed; he also noted that Belushi had, early in his career, briefly been a professional drummer, and had an especially keen sense of rhythm.|$|E

During his stay in NWA Bloom and Bull Pain challenged Nick Dinsmore & Rob Conway for the NWA OVW Southern tag team titles ending in a no contest. He briefly wrestled as Baldo, <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> {{given to him by}} referee Freddy Sparta that saw him wear a fur rug to the ring.|$|E
25|$|This crude {{approach}} {{results in}} the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the reverberation effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) that happen to be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to hardly more than <b>a</b> <b>gimmick</b> in those devices. Recent years have seen {{the development of new}} techniques based on the Fast Fourier Transform. Although still not perfect, the results are usually much better than the old technique, because the stereo left-right comparison can be done on individual frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Instruments made {{mostly from}} plastic, {{including}} the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, {{emerged in the}} 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce {{is different from that}} of brass. While originally seen as <b>a</b> <b>gimmick,</b> these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.|$|E
