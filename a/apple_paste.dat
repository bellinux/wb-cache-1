40|$|Fruit pieces {{prepared}} from pastes are now commonly {{added to}} breakfast cereals, snack bars and “healthy” confectionery. The {{objective was to}} determine the cell wall composition of heat-treated <b>apple</b> <b>paste</b> and apricot paste. The cell walls of <b>apple</b> <b>paste</b> and apricot paste were isolated and sequentially fractionated separately using HEPES, CDTA, Na 2 CO 3, 1 M KOH, 4 M KOH leaving a final residue. The monosaccharide composition of the fractions was consistent with the presence of cellulose, pectic polysaccharides, xyloglucans, heteroxylans and galactoglucomannans. The heat treatment during the <b>apple</b> <b>paste</b> and the apricot paste production did not change the overall amounts of neutral monosaccharides. Heat treatment resulted in the considerable solubilization of pectic polymers in water-soluble and CDTA-soluble fractions compared to Na 2 CO 3, KOH and final residue fractions of the fruit pastes. During heat treatment, tissue softening occurs due to the disruption of the constituent cell wall matrix...|$|E

This cuisine {{is known for its}} cooked dishes ("guisos") and its grilled or roasted meats ("asados"), its high-quality wines, the variety of its desserts, its sausages ("embutidos"), and its cheeses.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} {{palatability}} to North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx australis mantelli) of a range of non-toxic baits and flavours used to lure baits. During the wild bait trials incubation patterns of nesting male kiwi, chick behaviour and the presence of predators at the nesting burrow were recorded. A new 'improved' ground laid 1080 paste was also tested on a range of non-target bird species. All ten captive kiwi fed at least once on at least one bait type (i. e. carrot, No. 7, RS 5, <b>apple</b> pulp, and <b>paste)</b> but did not prefer any to their usual artificial diet. Wild kiwi did not feed on any bait type placed outside the nest entrance, but may have ingested <b>apple</b> pulp, or <b>paste</b> when they probed these baits. Results indicate that cereal-based baits are the safest bait type to sow aerially in kiwi habitat, while apple pulp baits are highly acceptable to kiwi. Cinnamon, aniseed, orange and clove flavours did not significantly attract or deter captive kiwi from feeding on portions of their usual diet. Insufficient flavoured cereal No. 7 baits were eaten to determine whether any bait and flavour combination affected kiwi response to these baits. No wild kiwi fed on any cinnamon or orange flavoured No. 7 cereal baits placed outside the nesting burrow, but kiwi did probe these baits. Incubating male kiwi left the nest once each night, except for two kiwi which sometimes left the nest twice in a night. One of these sometimes made three trips from the nest in a night. The active period of kiwi {{did not appear to be}} influenced by the number of times they emerged in a night. Male kiwi tended to spend less time away from the nest when chicks were due to hatch, following which they increased the time spent away. Possums, rats and mice regularly visited kiwi nests, but did not deter males from incubating, or harm kiwi eggs or chicks. Five species - robin, saddleback, blackbird, pukeko and weka, fed on a non-toxic cinnamon-lured form of 1080 paste. Species other than those mentioned rarely landed on the ground and therefore encountered paste infrequently. Captive weka found the paste highly palatable, while 24 % of robins and possibly half of a pukeko family fed on the paste. All bird visits to the paste baits declined after the first day of exposure. Recommendations are made on the safe laying of paste baits in areas where robin, saddleback, weka or pukeko are present...|$|R
40|$|Background: Plaque is {{the main}} cause of caries and {{diseases}} of the oral cavity. Caries and periodontal disease can be prevented by removing plaque. One of the way to inhibit the formation of plaque is by brushing the teeth with toothpaste. In this study used toothpaste with the content of apples (Pyrus malus) because, according to previous studies, into apples there are catechins that can inhibit the formation of dental plaque by inhibiting the glycosylation process and kill the bacteria in plaque. Methods: The research design of clinical trials conducted by the post test only control group design. The sample of this study is the boarding school students Qosim Al-Hadi, Mijen, Semarang, as many as 30 students were divided into two groups of randomized control group and treatment group. As an independent variable is the provision of toothpaste containing apples, while the dependent variable is the score of dental plaque. Data analysis was processed with SPSS for Windows 15. 0 with a standard test of significance p < 0. 05. Result: Difference score of plaque in the control groups (student without action) is higher than the treatment groups (student who are brushing them teeth with toothpaste content of apples). The result of the statistic with Independent Sample T-Test showed a significant difference of 0, 015 (p< 0, 05) between the control groups with the treatment groups. Conclusion: There are significant differences between the scores of plaque in the control groups with the treatment groups.
