50|$|Fossils {{from many}} {{other parts of}} the world have been {{assigned}} to Saniwa, although all are fragmentary. In 1899, Argentine paleontologist Florentino Ameghino named another species of Saniwa, S. australis, from lower Miocene rocks in Argentina. It is now considered a dubious name, because the material cannot be assigned with confidence to Saniwa. S. orsmaelensis was described from Belgium in 1923, but because its naming was informal, it was designated a naked name. S. orsmaelensis was later suggested to be either synonymous with S. ensidens or a different, indeterminate species of Saniwa. Unlike the Argentine fossils, the Belgian remains represent a definite occurrence of Saniwa outside North <b>America.</b> <b>S.</b> feisti was named from the Eocene Messel Pit in Germany in 1983. S. feisti is no longer considered to be a species of Saniwa, but a more primitive member of the family Varanidae.|$|E

50|$|A {{black fly}} (sometimes called a Blandford fly, buffalo gnat, turkey gnat, or white socks) is {{any member of}} the family Simuliidae of the Culicomorpha infraorder. They are related to the Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, and Thaumaleidae. Over 1,800 species of black flies are known (of which 11 are extinct). Most species belong to the immense genus Simulium. Most black flies gain {{nourishment}} by feeding on the blood of mammals, including humans, although the males feed mainly on nectar. They are usually small, black or gray, with short legs, and antennae. They are a common nuisance for humans, and many U.S. states have programs to suppress the black fly population. They spread several diseases, including river blindness in Africa (Simulium damnosum and S. neavei) and the Americas (S. callidum and S. metallicum in Central <b>America,</b> <b>S.</b> ochraceum in Central and South America).|$|E
50|$|Similar species include S. dudleyi and S. austriaca, {{and in the}} literature, {{confusion}} {{amongst the}} three is common. Examination of microscopic features is often required to definitively differentiate between the species. Sarcoscypha occidentalis has smaller cups (0.5-2.0 cm wide), a more pronounced stalk that is 1-3 cm long, and a smooth exterior surface. Unlike S. coccinea, it is only found in the New World and in east and midwest North America, {{but not in the}} far west. It also occurs in Central America and the Caribbean. In North <b>America,</b> <b>S.</b> austriaca and S. dudleyi are found in eastern regions of the continent. S. dudleyi has elliptical spores with rounded ends that are 25-33 by 12-14 µm and completely sheathed when fresh. S. austriaca has elliptical spores that are 29-36 by 12-15 µm that are not completely sheathed when fresh, but have small polar caps on either end. The Macaronesian species S. macaronesica, frequently misidentified as S. coccinea, has smaller spores, typically measuring 20.5-28 by 7.3-11 µm and smaller fruit bodies—up to 2 cm wide.|$|E
50|$|Smilodon lived {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya-10,000 years ago), and {{was perhaps the}} most recent of the saber-toothed cats. Smilodon {{probably}} lived in a closed habitat such as forest or bush. Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas. In North America, the varied habitat supported other saber-toothed cats in addition to Smilodon, such as Homotherium and Xenosmilus; the habitat here varied from subtropical forests and savannah in the south, to treeless mammoth steppes in the north. Smilodon inhabited the temperate latitudes of North America, where the mosaic vegetation of woods, shrubs, and grasses in the southwest supported large herbivores such as horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. Other large carnivores included dire wolves, short-faced bear (Arctodus simus) and the American lion. Due to competition from larger carnivores in North <b>America,</b> <b>S.</b> fatalis was perhaps not able to attain the same size as S. populator. The similar sizes of S. fatalis and the American lion suggests niche overlap and direct competition between these species, and they appear to have fed on similarly sized prey.|$|E

5000|$|Long {{the most}} {{completely}} known saber-toothed cat, Smilodon {{is still one}} of the best-known members of the group, to the point where the two concepts have been confused. The term [...] "saber-tooth" [...] refers to an ecomorph consisting of various groups of extinct predatory synapsids (mammals and close relatives), which convergently evolved extremely long maxillary canines, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use. This includes members of Gorgonopsia, Thylacosmilidae, Machaeroidinae, Nimravidae, Barbourofelidae, and Machairodontinae. Within the family Felidae (true cats), members of the subfamily Machairodontinae are referred to as saber-toothed cats, and this group is itself divided into three tribes: Metailurini (false saber-tooths); Homotherini (scimitar-toothed cats); and Smilodontini (dirk-toothed cats), to which Smilodon belongs. Members of Smilodontini are defined by their long slender canines with fine to no serrations, whereas Homotherini are typified by shorter, broad, and more flattened canines, with coarser serrations. Members of Metailurini were less specialized and had shorter, less flattened canines, and are not recognized as members of Machairodontinae by some researchers.The earliest felids are known from the Oligocene of Europe, such as Proailurus, and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus Pseudaelurus. The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats was similar to that of the modern clouded leopards (Neofelis). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high bite force. As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. The earliest species of Smilodon is S. gracilis, which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of Megantereon, from which it probably evolved. Megantereon itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with Homotherium. S. gracilis reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. The younger Smilodon species are probably derived from S. gracilis. S. fatalis existed 1.6 million-10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced S. gracilis in North <b>America.</b> <b>S.</b> populator existed 1 million-10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.|$|E
