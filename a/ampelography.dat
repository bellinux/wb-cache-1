50|$|In 1901 - 1910 he and Victor Vermorel {{published}} Ampélographie. Traité général de viticulture, a seven-volume <b>ampelography</b> of 3,200 pages describing 5,200 grape varieties.|$|E
50|$|Much {{was written}} during the Renaissance on grape growing and wine production, favouring a more {{scientific}} approach. This literature {{can be considered}} the origin of modern <b>ampelography.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Simón de Roxas Cosme Damián Clemente y Rubio (27 September 1777, in Titaguas (Valencia, Spain) [...] - [...] 27 February 1827, in Madrid) was {{a renowned}} Spanish botanist, {{considered}} to be the father of Spanish <b>ampelography.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{science of}} <b>ampelography</b> began seriously in the 19th century, when it {{suddenly}} became {{important to understand}} more about the different species of vine, as they had very different resistance to disease and pests such as phylloxera.|$|E
5000|$|Pierre Galet (born January 28, 1921) is a French ampelographer {{and author}} {{who was an}} {{influential}} figure within <b>ampelography</b> in the 20th century and before DNA typing was widely introduced. Beginning in the 1950s, Pierre Galet introduced a system for identifying varieties based on the shape, contours and characteristics of {{the leaves of the}} vines, petioles, growing shoots, shoot tips, grape clusters, as well as the colour, size, seed content and flavour of the grapes. The impact and comprehensiveness of his work earned him the consideration as the [...] "father of modern ampelography". He started publishing within <b>ampelography</b> in the 1950s and his Ph.D. thesis was presented in 1967. He has also written popular science books on grape varieties. Galet was active at the École Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de Montpellier.|$|E
50|$|For {{his work}} in the {{advancement}} of viticulture and <b>ampelography,</b> Galet was made an Officier de l'Ordre du Mérite Agricole. In 1983, he was given a prize of special recognition by the L'Office national interprofessionnel des vins (OIV), the association of French vinters, for the collective body of his work.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ampelography</b> (ἄμπελος, [...] "vine" [...] + γράφος, 'writing') is {{the field}} of botany {{concerned}} with the identification and classification of grapevines, Vitis spp. Traditionally this {{has been done by}} comparing the shape and colour of the vine leaves and grape berries; more recently the study of vines has been revolutionised by DNA fingerprinting.|$|E
50|$|At {{first it}} {{was thought to be}} a {{seedling}} of Gamay, and conventional <b>ampelography</b> linked it to the Melon variety, but DNA fingerprinting showed that along with Chardonnay and Aligoté, it is one of many grapes {{to be the result of}} a cross between Gouais blanc (Heunisch) and Pinot. Gouais blanc was widely grown by the French peasantry in the Medieval ages.|$|E
50|$|This {{book was}} {{published}} {{as a result of}} his having met three prestigious agronomists: Esteban, Claudio Boutelou and Francisco Terán, head of the Botanic Gardens of Sanlúcar de Barrameda. They encouraged him to develop what was then a new discipline in Spain, that of <b>ampelography</b> or the study of vines. Rojas was to become the foremost European authority on this subject.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century there was a shift in {{attitude}} in viticulture from traditional techniques to the scientific method based on fields such as microbiology, chemistry and <b>ampelography.</b> This change came about also due to changes in economic and cultural aspects and in the way of life and in the consumption habits of wide sectors of the population starting to demand quality products.|$|E
5000|$|Mastroberardino is an Italian winery {{located in}} the Campania region. Founded in 1878, the winery {{is known for its}} {{production}} of Taurasi DOCG as well as its <b>ampelography</b> work in identifying and preserving ancient grape varieties like Greco and Fiano. The work of the Mastroberardino family, particularly Antonio Mastroberardino, in this field is widely respected and Antonio is often called [...] "The Grape Archaeologist".|$|E
50|$|The Barbera grape is {{believed}} to have originated in the hills of Monferrato in central Piedmont, Italy and is known from the thirteenth century. The first written proof of vinification is stored in the city hall of Nizza Monferrato and dates back to the seventeenth century. The wine enters officially in the roll of Piedmontese wines in 1798, the date of the first <b>Ampelography</b> made by Giuseppe Nuvolone-Pergamo, count of Scandaluzza from the Società Agraria di Torino (Agricultural Society of Turin).|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that the grape came to Germany after the Thirty Years War {{as there is a}} record of Sylvaner from Austria being planted at County of Castell in Franconia on 5 April 1659. So Germany celebrated the 350th anniversary of Silvaner in 2009. Its name has been taken to be {{associated}} with either Latin silva (meaning woods) or saevum (meaning wild), and before modern <b>ampelography</b> it was sometimes assumed that this variety had a close relationship with wild vines. Before DNA typing, some assumed an origin in Transylvania based on its name.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{profiling}} {{has shown}} that the grape is likely the offspring of the Swiss wine grape Rèze and an unknown second parent. That other parent maybe the Piedmontese grape Erbaluce which DNA analysis has shown to have some close relationship with Cascarolo bianco but the exact nature of that relationship is not yet known. In his 1887 handbook on <b>ampelography,</b> German ampelographer Hermann Goethe speculated that Cascarolo bianco was the same variety as the Hungarian wine grape Fehér Gohér (also known as Augster Weisser) but today DNA evidence {{has shown that}} the two grapes are unrelated.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Italian {{publisher}} L'Artistica Editrice published Illustrated Historical Universal <b>Ampelography,</b> a three {{volume set}} which contains {{the most important}} books edited in France and Italy between 1800 and 1900: the Ampélographie of Pierre Viala and Victor Vermorel, the grapes section of Pomona Italiana by Count Giorgio Gallesio and the Ampelografia Italiana of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. The book collects 551 color plates of grapes {{from all over the}} world, with texts in Italian and English, which describe the morphological and agricultural characteristics of each vine variety, as well as their synonyms and historical curiosities.|$|E
50|$|Until the Second World War, <b>ampelography</b> {{had been}} an art. Then Pierre Galet of the École {{nationale}} supérieure agronomique de Montpellier made a systematic assembly of criteria for the identification of vines. The Galet system {{was based on the}} shape and contours of the leaves, the characteristics of growing shoots, shoot tips, petioles, the sex of the flowers, the shape of the grape clusters and the colour, size and pips of the grapes themselves. The grapes are less affected by environmental factors than the leaves and the shoots, but are obviously not around for as long. He even included grape flavour as a criterion, but this is rather subjective.|$|E
5000|$|Passerina {{is both a}} rare local white grape that {{is found}} in the Marche, in Italy and a DOC for wines of the same name. Many {{researchers}} have studied its identity, so to boast an extensive bibliography and a high number of citations of the grapes on the most famous treatises of <b>ampelography.</b> However, its origins remain uncertain. Known by various names such as [...] "Pagadebito Gentile", [...] "Campolese" [...] and [...] "Uva Passera", the term [...] "Passerina" [...] is attributed to those grapes that have small berries often devoid of seeds. Passerina is used in some Marche wine blends, including the DOC Falerio dei Colli Ascolani.|$|E

There is still some confusion as to which variety is which with producers in the Elqui Province making dry, fruity and unfortified varietal wines labeled as true Pedro Ximénez that may in all actuality still be the Argentine Pedro Giménez.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the name}} Len de l'El comes from the Toulouse Occitan dialect. Incidentally, it is phonetically similar to the French translation loin de l'œil meaning [...] "far from the eye" [...] with the synonym sometimes still seen on wine labels along with other alternative spellings. Wine expert Oz Clarke explains that the name refers {{to the position of}} the fruit in respect to the bud : the clustered grapes have long stalks that attach to the fruiting cane at a distance that is farther from the bud (or [...] "eye", oeil in French) than most grape varieties. This explanation is supported by Gaillac wine growers and at least one French <b>ampelography</b> authority as well.|$|E
5000|$|Some ampelographers (such as Hermann Goethe in his 1887 {{handbook}} of <b>ampelography)</b> have long assumed that Grüner Veltliner {{is not related}} to the other varieties with [...] "Veltliner" [...] in their name (such as Roter Veltliner), or that it is only distantly related.

5000|$|Louis Étienne Ravaz or Louis Ravaz (Saint-Romain-de-Jalionas, Isère, 1863 — Montpellier, 1937) was a {{specialist}} of <b>ampelography</b> {{and one of}} the creators of modern viticulture. In 1892, he founded the grape research station of Cognac (French: Station viticole de Cognac), that he directed for several years. He was professor of viticulture (and from 1919 director) at the National School of Agriculture of Montpellier (École nationale d’agriculture de Montpellier). He contributed to the diffusion of the use of the American varieties in the regions affected by French blight (Phylloxera) and investigated the pathologies of the grapevine.

50|$|Pierre Galet {{was born}} in Monaco in 1921 and spent most his life in {{southern}} France. During World War II, Galet hid from the German authorities at the University of Montpellier. There he spent extensive amounts of time among the Department of Viticulture's Vitis collection which included samples of grapevines from across the globe. While there {{he was able to}} study the differences and learn about the different varieties. After the war, Galet would accept a teaching position at the University where from 1946-1989, he was at the forefront of advances in <b>ampelography</b> and was the mentor to several of the leading ampelographers of the late 20th century. Among his students was Paul Truel, who would categorize and identify several wine grapes varieties in Australia and Portugal. In addition to teaching, Galet traveled to wine regions in the United States, South America, Cyprus, North Africa, Asia and throughout Europe identifying grape varieties and settling legal disputes involving them. One such legal dispute involved the European Union regulations banning the use of American Vitis Labrusca vines, such as Isabella and Noah, in European vineyards. Galet has long been an advocate against forcing the mandatory uprooting of these vines, believing the ban is anachronistic.|$|E

40|$|Several grapevine {{varieties}} are grown in vineyards worldwide including interspecific (Vitis vinifera × Vitis spp), intraspecific (V. viniferaL. × V. vinifera L.) and inter×intraspecific (interspecific×intraspecific) hybrids with unknown origin, ambiguous naming and genetic identity. In this study, the genetic relations among eighteen grapevine hybrids and original varieties (Vitis vinifera L.) which have mostly {{been described by}} <b>ampelography</b> data were analysed using AFLP (Amplified Fragments Length Polymorphism) molecular marker technology. AFLP polymorphic fragments generated {{by a combination of}} restriction digestion and PCR amplifications were assessed for analysis of the polymorphisms among accessions. Polymorphic bands were scored and genetic similarity (GS) was calculated by Dice coefficient. Cluster analysis and principle coordinate analyses (PCO) of the results addressed the genetic distance among inter-intraspecific hybrids and original grapevine varieties; detected the level of genetic similarity between varieties and specific mutant or clone; assessed the genetic relations among varieties involved in the same pedigree; recognized same genotypes under different names (synonymes) and proposed the genetic identity for an unknown, in <b>ampelography</b> data variety cultivated in UK vineyard...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) dates back to 1984. The idea was to virtually assemble all accessions maintained in the worldwide existing collections to face genetic erosion. In many cases synonymy, homonymy and misnaming hampered the clear assignment of cultivars/accessions to prime names. In the past 15 years nuclear microsatellites, in particular the nine SSR-markers VVS 2, VVMD 5, VVMD 7, VVMD 25, VVMD 27, VVMD 28, VVMD 32, VrZAG 62 and VrZAG 79 were extensively applied for cultivar recognition in combination with <b>ampelography.</b> Genetic fin- gerprints of more than 15, 000  cultivars/accessions were collected. They were taken from more than 300 articles and from microsatellite databases on the web. Allele sizes were adapted according to own internal reference varieties. Comparison of profiles revealed new identities like: “Corbeau” = “Sevilhao”, “Gragnelut” = “Fer”, “Beretinjak” = “Bianco d’Alessano”. The activities aim to equip the prime names of VIVC with reliable genetic profiles combined with the validation of their identity by <b>ampelography.</b> Fingerprints from 1, 500 cultivars were already uploaded in VIVC. Two distinct search modules were imple- mented: “Microsatellites by varieties” and “Microsatellites by profiles”. The implementation assists the management of grape- vine genetic resources, e. g. trueness to type assessment in grapevine collections and serves research and breeding...|$|E
