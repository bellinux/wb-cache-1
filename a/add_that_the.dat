5|$|The Hetumoger {{confederation}} {{was under}} a dual leadership, according to Ibn Rusta and Gardizi (two Muslim scholars from the 10th and 11thcenturies, respectively, whose geographical books preserved texts from an earlier work written by Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani from Bukhara). The Hungarians' nominal or sacred leader was styled kende, while their military commander bore the title gyula. The same authors <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gyula commanded an army of 20,000 horsemen, but the reliability of this number is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E

The colors, state the scholars of the Vaishnava origin theory, link to black-colored Krishna and white-colored Balarama. They <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> goddess originally was Ekanamsa (Durga of Shaiva-Shakti tradition, sister of Krishna through his foster family).

25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Arabs and their Paulician allies became {{a turning point in}} the Arab–Byzantine Wars.

The Byzantine chroniclers <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> victorious general did not survive for long after his victory. A hagiography, written by a contemporary, claims that Petronas died on the same day as his spiritual father Saint Anthony the Younger, two years and two months after routing the Arab armies. He was buried in the Gastria Monastery, where his stone sarcophagus was placed opposite those of his sister, the Empress Theodora, and his nieces.|$|E

25|$|Tables {{published}} by the government's National Center for Health Statistics show that life expectancy at birth was 47.3 years in 1900, rose to 68.2 by 1950 and reached 77.3 in 2002. The latest annual report of the Social Security Agency (SSA) trustees projects that life expectancy will increase just {{six years in the}} next seven decades, to 83 in 2075. A separate set of projections, by the Census Bureau, shows more rapid growth. The Census Bureau projection is that the longer life spans projected for 2075 by the Social Security Administration will be reached in 2050. Other experts, however, think that the past gains in life expectancy cannot be repeated, and <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> adverse effect on the system's finances may be partly offset if health improvements or reduced retirement benefits induce people to stay in the workforce longer.|$|E
25|$|IBL was a {{franchise}} league commercially managed by an Indian sports rights management company, Sporty Solutionz as commercial partners. With the brand value of US$1 million, Indian Badminton League was the richest badminton league in the world. Jwala {{was one of}} the six marquee players and team captains to be auctioned. The auction itself was not short of controversy. The base price of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa was halved from USD 50,000 to USD 25,000, without the players' notice and Women's Doubles event was replaced by a second Men's Singles. This left both Jwala and Ashwini hurt and angry. Jwala was bought for USD 31,000 and captained the Delhi franchise, but the team did not reach the semis and finished fifth. Gutta and Ponnappa after IBL confirmed on that they were set to reunite. Jwala went on to <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two decided to come together because of a couple of reasons. The first was the Indian Badminton League's organisers knocking out the women's doubles category from the tournament, which in turn resulted in the base prices of Jwala and Ashwini.|$|E

Thomas noted the game's popularity among fans and that it plays almost exactly the same as the Master System version despite graphics and sound improvements; at the time, there were no Master System games on the Virtual Console. He praised the game's rich sound, gameplay depth, and [...] "colorful and cartoony" [...] graphics, which [...] "was perfectly suited to the TurboGrafx platform".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the video was a sequel of the music video [...] "Ocean Avenue"; [...] "The 'Holly' video expands {{on some of the}} elements of the 'Ocean Avenue' clip.

It refers to that world, and I liked the idea of paralleling the band's experiences {{over the past two years}} with some of the things [...] Ryan [...] is going through in this video." [...] Webb went on to <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reason Key is sprinting through Los Angeles, once again, is not bad guys that are after him, it is his [...] "own personal demons". Webb concluded that before filming began for the video, he had wanted to learn the experience that Key and bassist Peter Mosely were going through in New York, as they moved there to begin working on Lights and Sounds, and about the things they saw while they were there.|$|E
500|$|Authors Cheryl Meyer, Michelle Oberman, and Michelle Rone, {{discussing}} the Green case {{in their book}} Mothers Who Kill Their Children: Understanding the Acts of Moms from Susan Smith to the [...] "Prom Mom", point out that Green was adjudged psychologically competent at what would be commonly considered the least-controlled point of any mental illness from which she was suffering: {{she was on a}} cocktail of drugs which could treat the symptoms of mental illness but not the illness itself, she had been drinking alcohol in amounts which she had been warned could interfere with her medications, and she was coping with the loss of her children. Nevertheless, she spoke for her own mental competence at the time, a judgment which was echoed by the court. Meyer, Oberman, and Rone speculate that Green could meet the diagnostic criteria for several mental illnesses, including antisocial personality disorder, but <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fact that her crimes were a combination of impulsive—arson and the murder of her children—and premeditated—the poisoning of Michael Farrar—makes any mental illness [...] extremely difficult to diagnose.|$|E

500|$|It {{was assumed}} by many that Steinbeck had kept a journal {{during the trip}} and that the book was merely an {{amalgamation}} of his log and Ricketts' taxonomic list; but the two authors revealed that the journal was Ricketts'. Although Steinbeck had added to it during the journey, he had done the real work of editing it after they returned. The log was based on what Ricketts called the Verbatim Transcript, {{an account of the}} trip he had compiled from the various notes he kept during the trip. Much of the final narrative was little changed from Ricketts' notes; Steinbeck shifted from the first person singular to the first person plural and gave some of Ricketts' drier prose a poetic twist, but many of the scenes remained almost unchanged from the daily journal. The suggestion by Steinbeck's editor, Pascal Covici, that the title page should state that Steinbeck was the author and <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> appendices were by Ricketts met with blunt opposition from Steinbeck: [...] "I not only disapprove of your plan — I forbid it". Steinbeck also drew upon the journal of Tony Berry, mostly to confirm dates and times.|$|E
500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number. However, {{he felt that the}} song had modest goals, [...] "at least by Madonna's standards. Even when it gets a bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme for the umpteenth time without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots." [...] It further added that [...] "'Celebration' [...] a score for Madonna's retro-futuristic fan base and a nice bookend to her collection of chart glories." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Bego, {{author of}} Madonna: Blonde Ambition wrote that [...] "Spotlight" [...] was a [...] "typical Madonna 'look-at-me' dance routine, that sounds flat besides the heavy remixes in You Can Dance."

[...] Dave Barry from The Miami Herald commented that although You Can Dance sounds like [...] "old Madonna", [...] "Spotlight" [...] sounds surprisingly fresh to his ears. Joe Brown from The Washington Post commented that the song {{should have been a}} [...] "flat reject". Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "exuberant". Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times commented that [...] " [...] is an attractive package for dance fans—particularly with the inclusion of a new cut, 'Spotlight'". He went on to <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "lyrics of 'Spotlight' aren't great, but they're still more interesting than the others. Still, the words, like those of most dance songs, are just window dressing that's secondary to the beat. The big attraction of 'Spotlight' is a long, hard-driving, closing passage that's guaranteed to turn dancers on." [...] Jan DeKnock, while writing for Orlando Sentinel, noted that the song was already receiving airplay from radio stations.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} in Foo Fighters are {{nonsensical}} lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As the frontman, Grohl explained, [...] "I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there was too much to say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I look at them and some of them seem to actually have meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of {{the last four or five}} years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as [...] "This Is a Call", defined as [...] "a 'hello' and a 'thank you'" [...] to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl's life; the playful [...] "For All the Cows"; and [...] "Wattershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's [...] "love of hardcore and old school punk rock".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the mixed}} reaction, many critics were {{fond of the}} album. Rolling Stones music critic Jenny Eliscu wrote that the album [...] "has made what ends up {{being one of the}} best straight-up pop-rock albums of 2006". Elicsu also complimented the band, writing: [...] "Like the Goo Goo Dolls... Yellowcard have {{rightfully}} recognized the transcendent value of a big, fist-pumping anthem coated with a light dose of romantic schmaltz." [...] Alternative Press gave the album a perfect rating, saying, [...] "It {{may be one of the}} least 'punk' albums a pop-punk band will make this year--but it's probably one of the best, too." [...] Sputnikmusic gave the album 3.5 out of five stars, writing: [...] "It's pop-punk, and fairly unambitious stuff at that ... What keeps this record on its feet is the lyricism, the production and the simplicity of it all." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote: [...] "On Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard sounds light years away from its One for the Kids/Where We Stand days. Granted, the band still trades in the immediate melodies and heart-on-sleeve lyrics that they've used since the beginning, but major-label success suits them well." [...] Though, Phares went on to <b>add</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band [...] "ends up sounding self-assured instead of compromised in its big-budget surroundings." [...] Billboard magazine gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, and claimed that Yellowcard made a [...] "strong effort that trades sunny-sounding rockers and breakup songs for weightier concerns of war and family, 'Lights' conveys that maturity without seeming strained." [...] Dan McClanahan of Iowa State Daily wrote: [...] "...This disc will likely change people's opinion of Yellowcard. Much more angst and a drastically matured sound make for a pleasant surprise." [...] McClanahan revealed that he was not looking forward to listen to the album, but admitted once he heard he knew it embraced the band's [...] "strengths" [...] and that they [...] "greatly expanded the subject matter of its songs." ...|$|E
