5000|$|On a {{technical}} note, when the asset swap is initiated between coupon dates, the asset swap buyer {{does not pay}} the accrued interest explicitly. Effectively, the full price of the bond is at par. At the next coupon period the asset swap buyer receives the full coupon on the bond and likewise pays the full coupon on the swap. However, the floating side payment, which may have a different frequency and accrual basis to fixed side, is adjusted by the corresponding <b>accrual</b> <b>factor.</b> Therefore, if we are exactly half way between floating side coupons, the floating payment received is half of the Libor plus asset swap spread. This feature prevents the calculated asset swap spread from jumping {{as we move forward}} in time through coupon dates.|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies two {{well known}} anomalies, the asset growth anomaly and the {{external}} financing anomaly. Chapter 1 examines {{the role of}} limits to arbitrage on the asset growth anomaly or the negative relationship between capital investment or asset growth and subsequent stock returns. We hypothesize that if the negative relationship is due to mispricing, it should be more pronounced and more persistent when there are more severe limits to arbitrage. The empirical evidence supports our hypothesis and the anomaly also vanishes when arbitrage is easy. Our findings are neither due to conventional risks, firm characteristics, equity issuance, idiosyncratic risk, manifestation of liquidity risk, and are not ex-post justified by trading expenses consisted of bid-ask spreads and commissions. Finally, limits to arbitrage also subsume the firm-size effect in the cross-sectional variation in the asset growth anomaly documented by Cooper et al. (2008) and Fama and French (2008). Chapter 2 offers a novel understanding of {{the cause of the}} external financing anomaly or the negative relationship between net overall external financing activities and future stock returns. Recent studies argue that the negative relationship is driven by earnings management and/or investment growth. However, we find that about half of the anomaly remains unexplained by these interpretations. The remaining predictability is not due to exposures to conventional risks, firm characteristics, the <b>accruals</b> <b>factor,</b> the asset growth factor, the wealth transfer hypothesis, or the issuer risk hypothesis, and is not driven by performance delistings or delistings associated with negative returns or unknown risks. Instead, it is attributed to the overvalued young and small unprofitable firms that lack internal funds and have limited access to public debt markets rely heavily on equity and modestly on private debt external financing to pursue their ambitious growth strategies through heavily investing in research and development...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{accruals}} quality and disclosure quality on stock returns is a topical issue in market-based accounting research. Most {{of the debate}} is centred on their incremental ability to predict future earnings. Recent studies suggest that higher information risk proxied by either lower accruals quality or lower disclosure quality results in higher stock returns. This paper examines the relationship between accruals quality and disclosure quality, and investigates whether they are complements or substitutes in explaining the time-series variation in portfolio returns. Applying portfolio groupings, we find a positive association between accruals quality and disclosure quality, suggesting that firms with higher disclosure quality engage less in earnings management and have higher accruals quality. Asset pricing tests show that an <b>accruals</b> quality <b>factor</b> and a disclosure quality factor explain the time-series variation in the excess returns of similar sets of portfolios. This suggests that they contain similar information and confirms the substitutive nature of accruals quality and disclosure quality factors...|$|R

40|$|The accrual {{information}} {{is discussed in}} light of multifactor factor asset pricing theory. It is argued that the capital market processes information efficiently, and that low accruals firms are risky and therefore earn higher average returns. In other words, the level of accruals proxies for the loading on a fundamental risk factor that drives stock returns. The objective {{of this study is}} to prove significance influence of accrual information and to evaluate the performance of stock portfolio constructed by Treynor Index, Jensen-Alpha, and Sharpe Index. The final sample are the past and present member of LQ- 45 public companies. Following Fama and French (1993), we form a factormimicking portfolio that essentially goes long on low accruals firms and short on high accruals firms (Conservative Minus Aggressive, or CMA). Since the portfolio is constructed based upon the return-predicting characteristic itself, it is thereby designed to capture any risk factors that may underly the accrual effect even if the relevant risk factors are not observed directly. The empirical result show that partially, CMA has a significance positive (negative) influence to stock portfolio with low (high) level accrual, both for single, two, and three factor model, especially at size-accrual category. Other empiric result is addition of factor CMA, proved increasing explanatory power of model in explaining the variation of expected return of stock portfolio on various asset pricing model.

40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to study}} the behavior and determinants of earnings quality and accruals persistence, examining the impact of both internal factor (components of earnings and <b>accruals)</b> and external <b>factor</b> (sign of income, economic state and business cycle). The main conclusion emerging from my study can be summarized Supporting Sloan’s conjectures; I find that persistence of earnings is higher than cash flow in high accruals firms but lower than cash flow in low accruals firms. And both extreme positive cash flow and negative cash flow reduce persistence of cash flow and earnings. Interestingly, even though the positive relationship between cash flow and earnings is strongly significant in my study, the result fails to show that accruals is negative correlated with earnings, which is commonly predicted in both theory and empirical evidence. Also empirical result reveals that accruals anomaly and cash flow anomaly do not necessarily occur together. Additionally, {{there is no significant}} difference on earnings persistence between firms reporting profit or loss, but earnings quality and accruals persistence do show negative impact from recession. Also the correlation between two components of earnings shows reversal during recession. Generally, my study supports the existence of accruals anomaly and earnings management, however we suggest that it is accruals that firms use in manipulation activities...|$|R
40|$|Background-—Cross-sectional {{clustering}} of metabolic {{risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease in middle-aged adults is well described, but less is known regarding {{the order in which}} risk factors develop through young adulthood and their relation to subclinical atherosclerosis. Method and Results-—A total of 3178 black and white women and men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were assessed to identify the order in which cardiovascular disease risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high triglyceride levels), hypercholesterolemia (high total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and obesity develop. Observed patterns of risk factor development were compared with those expected if risk factors accumulated randomly, given their overall distribution in the population. Over the 20 years of follow-up, 80 % of participants developed at least 1 risk factor. The first factor to occur was dyslipidemia in 39 % of participants, obesity in 20 %, hypercholesterolemia in 11 %, hypertension in 7 %, and diabetes in 1 %. Dyslipidemia was the only risk factor both to occur first and to be followed by additional risk factors more often than expected (P< 0. 001 for both). Order of risk <b>factor</b> <b>accrual</b> did not affect subclinical atherosclerosis at year 20. Results were similar by sex, race, and smoking status.

We use the stocks that are consistently listed in the U. S. Dow Jones Islamic index for a sample period from 1996 to 2012. We also include two macroeconomic mimicking portfolios to capture the premiums of industrial production growth and inflation innovation, accommodating the economic regime shifts. Based on the information coefficients, we find the six-month momentum and the fractal measure as momentum factors; the enterprise yield (gross profit/TEV) and the book to market ratio as valuation factors; the gross profit to total assets, the return on capital, and the scaled total <b>accruals</b> as quality <b>factors.</b> We further construct active portfolios using the augmented Black Litterman (ABL) factor model to avoid the factor alignment problem, with the factor views predicted using Markov Switching VAR, MIDAS, and Bayesian Model Averaging. The out-of-sample performance of our portfolios can produce information ratios of 0. 7 – 0. 8 over the composite indices, and information ratios of 0. 42 – 0. 48 over the style indices, with the annualized alphas of 10 – 11 %. Even when we put the constrained tracking error of 1 % over the benchmark, our portfolios still produce information ratios of 0. 9 – 1. 2 before transaction costs, and 0. 6 – 0. 8 after transaction costs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cytosolic DNA sensors detect {{microbial}} DNA {{and promote}} type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokine production through the adaptor stimulator of IFN genes (STING) to resolve infection. Endogenous DNA also engages the STING pathway, contributing to autoimmune disease. This {{study sought to}} identify the role of STING in regulating bone formation and to define the bone phenotype and its pathophysiologic mechanisms in arthritic mice double deficient in DNase II and IFN-alpha/beta/omega receptor (IFNAR) (DNase II-/- /IFNAR-/- double-knockout [DKO] mice) compared with controls. METHODS: Bone parameters were evaluated by micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry in DKO mice in comparison with mice triple deficient in STING, DNase II, and IFNAR and control mice. Cell culture techniques were employed to determine the parameters of osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and function. NanoString and Affymetrix array analyses were performed to identify factors promoting ectopic bone formation. RESULTS: Despite the expression of proinflammatory cytokines that {{would be expected to}} induce bone loss in the skeleton of DKO mice, the results, paradoxically, demonstrated an accumulation of bone in the long bones and spleens, sites of erythropoiesis and robust DNA <b>accrual.</b> In addition, <b>factors</b> promoting osteoblast recruitment and function were induced. Deficiency of STING significantly inhibited bone accrual. CONCLUSION: These data reveal a novel role for cytosolic DNA sensor pathways in bone in the setting of autoimmune disease. The results demonstrate the requirement of an intact STING pathway for bone formation in this model, a finding that may have relevance to autoimmune diseases in which DNA plays a pathogenic role. Identification of pathways linking innate immunity and bone could reveal novel targets for the treatment of bone abnormalities in human autoimmune diseases...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades the {{introduction}} of mammographic screening in the Western world has increased the number of diagnosed ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) considerably. In situ carcinoma of the breast is considered a heterogeneous disease, the natural history of which is not well known. Thus, appropriate treatment needs to be established. For this reason, a randomised trial studying the effect of breast conserving operation with or without postoperative radiotherapy was instituted in Southern Sweden in 1987. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess patient <b>accrual,</b> identify limiting <b>factors,</b> and evaluate possible ways to influence these factors in order to increase patient accrual. Between 1987 and 1992, 331 patients had been registered with DCIS in the Regional Tumour Registry, 96 of which had been randomised. All 331 were subjected to chart review studying clinical data, mammography reports, cytology and pathology reports to identify inclusion and exclusion criteria according to the design of the trial. It was found that 5 % (18 / 331) had an incorrect diagnosis of DCIS. According to the trial protocol 52 % were not eligible (162 / 313). Fifty-eight per cent (n= 88) of the 151 eligible patients had been correctly randomised. The most common reason for exclusion was lesion size. In 21 % (66 / 313) the lesion was 'too large'. Several other limiting factors were identified such as in cytological and pathological definitions and reports, lack of information/awareness in certain physicians, patient reluctance to participate, which in turn may be influenced by the previous factor. With increased information to participating hospitals and considering the above given facts it should be possible to increase accrual from the 28 % noted in the present consecutive demographic study to at least one-third of the diagnosed cases of DCIS...|$|R
40|$|Brain metastases {{occur in}} up to 75 % of {{patients}} with advanced melanoma. Most are treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with limited effectiveness. Vandetanib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor and rearranged during transfection tyrosine kinases, is a potent radiosensitiser in xenograft models. We compared WBRT with WBRT plus vandetanib {{in the treatment of}} patients with melanoma brain metastases. In this double-blind, multi-centre, phase 2 trial patients with melanoma brain metastases were randomised to receive WBRT (30 [*]Gy in 10 fractions) plus 3 weeks of concurrent vandetanib 100 [*]mg once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in brain (PFS brain). The main study was preceded by a safety run-in phase to confirm tolerability of the combination. A post-hoc analysis and literature review considered barriers to recruiting patients with melanoma brain metastases to clinical trials. Twenty-four patients were recruited, six to the safety phase and 18 to the randomised phase. The study closed early due to poor recruitment. Median PFS brain was 3. 3 months (90 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 6 - 5. 6) in the vandetanib group and 2. 5 months (90 % CI: 0. 2 - 4. 8) in the placebo group (P= 0. 34). Median overall survival (OS) was 4. 6 months (90 % CI: 1. 6 - 6. 3) and 2. 5 months (90 % CI: 0. 2 - 7. 2), respectively (P= 0. 54). The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, alopecia, confusion and nausea. The most common barrier to study recruitment was availability of alternative treatments. The combination of WBRT plus vandetanib was well tolerated. Compared with WBRT alone, there was no significant improvement in PFS brain or OS, although we are unable to provide a definitive result due to poor accrual.

40|$|Study Purpose: Ovarian cancer, {{the most}} lethal {{gynecologic}} cancer, {{has had a}} relatively stable mortality rate since 1975, despite a decrease in mortality for all gynecologic cancers combined. Standard-of-care advances are needed to reduce ovarian cancer morbidity and mortality. Advances must, however, undergo a long, rigorously controlled research process that can take {{more than ten years}} before becoming available to the public. Further, few women with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer are offered or enrolled in the clinical trials that do exist at select sites throughout the nation. The purpose of this multiple-case study is to identify necessary and/or sufficient factors associated with enrollment in ovarian cancer clinical trials, and to identify facilitators and barriers within the practice setting that, in the longer term, can be used to inform targeted interventions to improve trial access and <b>accrual.</b> The multilevel <b>factors</b> that were explored were aligned with the Consolidated Framework for Intervention Research (CFIR). The study sought to answer two research questions. (1) Based on Qualitative Comparative Analysis [QCA (Ragin, 1989) ], what necessary and/or sufficient factors would enable a woman with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer to enroll in a clinical trial in Florida? (2) What barriers and facilitators, practitioner and patient-specific, exist with regard to enrolling women with ovarian cancer in clinical trials? Materials and Methods: This multiple case study used online surveys to obtain quantitative and qualitative data from two populations: women with ovarian cancer and nurses at various referring practice sites. Data from Moffitt Cancer Center’s Total Cancer Care protocol was requested to conduct chart reviews that would identify prospective participants. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), which is useful for determining causality in small sample sizes, was used to determine necessary and/or sufficient factors associated with enrollment by women with ovarian cancer in clinical trials, as well as barriers and facilitators related to clinical trial enrollment. Results: Women with ovarian cancer who participated in clinical trials were stage III/IV, wanted information, and engaged in discussion about clinical trials, making those factors necessary for enrollment in a study. Facilitators for participation were discussion with the provider of care, to some extent the existence of patient-accessible clinical trial literature in the practice, knowledge that health insurance covers standard of care costs, and having a provider who offers clinical trials. Absence of those factors thus constitutes a barrier. For nurses, the impact of having a practice team plan was related to enrolling women with ovarian cancer in clinical trials, and feeling informed and comfortable with questions women might ask about trials. Conclusion: Clinical trials are an underutilized priority for improving the standard of care and reducing the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with ovarian cancer. The data show deficits and needs within two key interrelated populations: medical oncology practice nurses and women with ovarian cancer. Opportunities exist within each level of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR); interviews should be used to confirm the findings, which can be used to establish an interventional protocol to increase clinical trial enrollment by women with ovarian cancer...|$|R
