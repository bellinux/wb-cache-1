40|$|Law, Force and Diplomacy at Sea, first {{published}} in 1985, {{is one of the}} few comprehensive treatments on the subject from a strategic perspective. It offers a detailed strategic analysis of the background and outcome of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, and its naval implications. The interplay between the interest of the naval powers in freedom of navigation and the interest of coastal states in control provides the setting for the strategic problems. The sea is taking on more properties of the land: it <b>is</b> becoming ?territorialised?, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> presenting <b>fresh</b> challenges <b>and</b> opportunities to which navies and their national governments have to respond. <b>This</b> study <b>is</b> designed for students of naval strategy, for international lawyers and for students of international affairs who wish to think about the important security questions in the maritime environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Flood is a {{communication}} primitive {{that can be}} used by the base station of a sensor network to send a copy of a message to every sensor in the network. When a sensor receives a flood message, the sensor needs to check whether it has received this message for the first time <b>and</b> so <b>this</b> message <b>is</b> <b>fresh,</b> or it has received the same message earlier and so the message <b>is</b> redundant. In <b>this</b> paper, we discuss a family of four flood sequencing protocols that use sequence numbers to distinguish between fresh and redundant flood messages. These four protocols are: a sequencing free protocol, a linear sequencing protocol, a circular sequencing protocol, and a differentiated sequencing protocol. We analyze the self-stabilization properties of these four flood sequencing protocols. We also compare the performance of these flood sequencing protocols, using simulation, over various settings of sensor networks. We conclude that the differentiated sequencing protocol has better stabilization property and provides better performance than those of the other three protocols.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} are potentially {{one of the}} most important technologies of this century. Recent advancement in wireless communications and electronics have enabled the development of low-cost, low-power, multifunctional miniature devices for use in remote sensing applications Flood is a communication primitive that can be used by the base station of a sensor network to send a copy of a message to every sensor in the network. When a sensor receives a flood message, the sensor needs to check whether it has received this message for the first time <b>and</b> so <b>this</b> message <b>is</b> <b>fresh,</b> or it has received the same message earlier and so the message is redundant. A family of four flood sequencing protocols that use sequence numbers to distinguish between fresh and redundant flood messages. These four protocols are: a sequencing free protocol, a linear sequencing protocol, a circular sequencing protocol, and a differentiated sequencing protocol. A stabilization properties of these four flood sequencing protocols will be analyzed for multiple sources. The objective is that the differentiated sequencing protocol has better stabilization property and provides better performance than those of the other three protocols...|$|R

The data collected showed that households can be grouped, into low, middle and high income groups and the analysis revealed that majority of the households in the study area fell within the low income group <b>and</b> <b>this</b> group spent a higher percentage of their income on fish. The study revealed that household size, educational status of household head, taste of fish, availability of fish, ease of preparation of fish, income of household head had significant effects on the preference and consumption pattern of fish in the study area. The result revealed that majority of the households (about 50 %) preferred frozen form of fish <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> followed by <b>fresh</b> water fish while a few made smoked fish their choice. It was found out that factors which were significant to frozen fish include availability of fish, household size, ease of preparation of fish, freshness of fish while those significant to fresh water include educational status, level of household head, taste of fish, cleanliness of fish and factors significant to smoked fish include availability of fish, ease of preparation of fish, household size and freshness of fish...|$|R

25|$|Since the oil industry's {{earliest}} days, {{discovery and}} production have periodically taken a human toll. For Canada's petroleum industry, the worst incident was the Ocean Ranger disaster of 1982.

40|$|<b>Fresh</b> fruit {{consumption}} <b>is</b> {{being promoted}} {{for health reasons}} in North America, Europe and other regions. Consumers are responding, {{as evidenced by the}} 20 percent increase in per capita fruit consumption in the past 30 years. US consumers have increased fruit consumption by 23 percent, but they still consume half the amount recommended by the dietary guidelines of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Fruit production often requires significant intervention with pesticides to control pests and diseases. Thus, health conscious consumers increasingly see organic fruit as a logical package. Fruit and vegetable sales account for about 40 percent of the retail sales of organic foods in the US (93 percent of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> produce), with fruit estimated to represent about half of this. In Europe, organic fruit sales represent about five percent of all fruit sales, but the market penetration differs considerably by the specific fruit. Apples, pears, grapes (including grapes for wine, raisins and table grapes), strawberries and peaches are among the top temperate fruits consumed in the US and Europe. These fruits can also be grown in those regions and thus supply a significant share of the organic market...|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving Portuguese {{opinion is}} on the Cantino planisphere of 1502. Because its demarcation line was midway between Cape Saint Roque (northeast cape of South America) and {{the mouth of the}} Amazon River (its estuary is marked Todo este mar he de agua doçe—"All of <b>this</b> sea <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> water"—and its river is marked Rio grande, [...] "great river"), Harrisse concluded that the line was at 42°30'W on our sphere. Harrisse believed the large estuary just west of the line on the Cantino map was that of the Rio Maranhão (<b>this</b> estuary <b>is</b> now the Baía de São Marcos and the river is now the Mearim), whose flow is so weak that its gulf does not contain fresh water.|$|R

Caught using longlines, gillnets, trawls, <b>and</b> hook-and-line, <b>this</b> shark <b>is</b> marketed <b>fresh</b> or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and longline catches, respectively. <b>This</b> species <b>is</b> {{also one of the}} most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India.

40|$|As {{the first}} {{historian}} of Christianity, Luke's reliability is vigorously disputed among scholars. The {{author of the}} Acts is often {{accused of being a}} biased, imprecise, and anti-Jewish historian who created a distorted portrait of Paul. Daniel Marguerat tries to avoid being caught in this true/false quagmire when examining Luke's interpretation of history. Instead he combines different tools - reflection upon historiography, the rules of ancient historians and narrative criticism - to analyse the Acts and gauge the historiographical aims of their author. Marguerat examines the construction of the narrative, the framing of the plot and the characterization, and places his evaluation firmly in the framework of ancient historiography, where history reflects tradition <b>and</b> not documentation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a <b>fresh</b> <b>and</b> original approach to the classic themes of Lucan theology: Christianity between Jerusalem and Rome, the image of God, the work of the Spirit, the unity of Luke and the Acts...|$|R

40|$|Making {{tangible}} {{connections between}} theory and practice, ideas <b>and</b> form, <b>this</b> book encourages debate about the artistic, conceptual, and cultural significance of the way things look. What are the metaphysical concepts {{at the heart of}} design education, theory, and philosophy? Why do we assume that design is impossible to teach? This book challenges the traditional foundations of perception and takes an imaginative, radical approach, setting itself apart from the traditions of analytical philosophy, evolutionary psychology, and phenomenology which underpin much of current design theory and discourse. The new definition of perception produces startling consequences for conceptions of language, intelligence, meaning, the senses, emotions <b>and</b> subjectivity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> an innovative, <b>fresh</b> view on design and how we can improve it for both practitioners and students in the architecture and design fields as well as philosophers. © 2010 Kathryn Moore.
