50|$|A battery {{electric}} multiple unit, battery {{electric railcar}} or <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcar</b> is an electrically driven multiple unit or railcar whose energy {{is derived from}} rechargeable batteries that drive its traction motors.|$|E
50|$|Between 1 May and 31 October {{the museum}} railway runs {{scheduled}} trains on Sundays. For {{the operation of}} the museum the DFS has a fleet comprising three steam locomotives, an <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcar,</b> four diesel locomotives and a diesel railbus {{as well as a number}} of historic passenger coaches.|$|E
50|$|From 1897, <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> {{of classes}} MC and MBCC were {{operated}} between Ludwigshafen and Neustadt. Wittfeld <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars,</b> which were stationed in Kaiserslautern, operated from 1926 to about 1952, mainly between Kaiserslautern and Landstuhl.|$|R
50|$|From 1963 rollingstock used {{included}} class 86 locomotives, class ETA 150 <b>accumulators</b> <b>railcars</b> {{with control}} cars, single-engine rail buses of class VT 95 with control cars and diesel railcars of class VT 60 with control cars.|$|R
50|$|Local {{passenger}} services between Limburg and Au were operated mainly with class VT 95 and VT 98 railbuses. After 1989 {{the line was}} served by class 628 diesel multiple units. Some services from the 1950s were also operated with <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> of classes 515 and 517.|$|R
50|$|Until 30 May 1986, <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> {{of class}} 515 ran between Duisburg-Rheinhausen and Hohenbudberg Siedlung. Then the Rhenish line from Krefeld-Linn {{to the former}} Hohenbudberg {{marshalling}} yard was completely dismantled along with the yard. Instead, the line now uses the parallel route of the Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company (Ruhrort-Crefeld−Kreis Gladbach Eisenbahngesellschaft).|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{contemporary}} posibilities of replacement diesel-powered <b>railcars</b> by <b>accumulator</b> powered <b>railcars</b> in regional railway traffic. In {{the first part of}} the paper, there are described advantages and disadvantages of this replacement. In the second part are presented the simulation counts and the simulation results of the drive of an <b>accumulator</b> powered <b>railcar</b> on the railway line Šumperk - Kouty nad Desnou. At the last part of this paper is shown the experimental <b>accumulator</b> powered <b>railcar,</b> which was built at University of Pardubice, and the energy research, that is realized with this railcar at railway line Mladějov na Moravě - Hřebeč...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of many years of {{favourable}} experience {{with this type of}} vehicle (the Prussian state railways had placed <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> in service as early as 1907 - these were later the Class ETA 178 in the Deutsche Reichsbahn) and of the evaluation of the results with the Class ETA 176 prototypes, the DB placed 232 Class ETA 150 power cars and 216 of their associated Class ESA 150 driving cars in service between 1953 and 1965.|$|R
50|$|Except for {{commuter}} {{and school}} services, the passenger trains were predominantly operated with railcars and DMUs. For a long time, the Lahn Valley Railway was {{a focus for}} the operation of <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> of classes ETA 176 and ETA 150 sets with up to four cars. The Uerdingen railbus was also used in various versions. However, from 1987, these vehicles were quickly replaced by new class 628 diesel locomotives, which also displaced some of the locomotive-hauled trains. This would not change until December 2004.|$|R
50|$|In 1887 {{the first}} German <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> {{were placed in}} service by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Their {{development}} continued with the pre-Second World War classes ETA 177 to 180, the post-war DB Class ETA 176 and finally ended with DB Classes 150, 515 and 517. The latter were used until 1995 having been since modernised into the Nokia ETA, painted light grey and green and deployed onto the so-called Nokia Railway (timetable number RB 46), nowadays the Glückauf-Bahn from Gelsenkirchen via Wanne-Eickel to Bochum.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{financial}} crisis of the 1890s work proceeded slowly and Poggio Rusco was reached on 20 January 1902. The new trunk was operated from its opening with electric traction, using <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars.</b> Indeed, from 1 May 1901 the SFM began to operate this type of traction between San Felice and Bologna, extending to the new concession when it was opened for operation. Four rail cars were constructed by Diatto with two Ganz 30 kW electric motors, and with 52 seats. They were numbered RA 001-004 and could reach speeds of 60 km/h. The trial ended in 1903.|$|R
50|$|Experiments with <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars,</b> as {{they were}} {{originally}} called, were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the Edison-Beach type, with nickel-iron batteries were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a battery-electric Edison railcar operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm nickel-zinc battery was used on four 2-car sets between 1932 and 1946 on the Harcourt Street Line in Ireland and British Railways used lead-acid batteries in a railcar in 1958. Between 1955 and 1995 DB railways successfully operated 232 DB Class ETA 150 railcars utilising lead-acid batteries.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, {{a branch}} line was opened to Könnern along with Baalberge station. In 1890, a branch was opened to Calbe. In 1898 and 1899, {{the line was}} duplicated. There were plans in 1908 for the {{electrification}} of the track. The first <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> were used {{on the line from}} 1908. The second track was removed after World War II between Köthen and Güsten to provide reparations to the Soviet Union. In the post-war period, many trains carrying spoil from open-cut lignite mines operated over the line. In 1952, a station was opened at Frenz between Köthen and Bernburg.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, {{the line}} was cut between Zollhaus and Kettenbach by {{the border between the}} American and French {{occupation}} zone. Special passes were required to travel on the trains. Later this became the border between Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate. From the 1960s on, this line was mainly served by <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> of class 517, known as Limburger Zigarre (Limburg cigars). In addition, {{the line was}} served by Silberling carriages, hauled by class 216 diesel locomotives. On 25 September 1983, the last scheduled passenger train ran between Wiesbaden and Bad Schwalbach. On 28 September 1986, the remaining northern section of the line was closed to traffic; at the end it was still used by Uerdingen railbuses.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{operated}} almost continuously with both passenger and freight traffic. The longest passenger services operated from the 1950s to the 1970s {{as a single}} daily pair of services between Büsum and Eutin and later between Heide and Neustadt. Both routes crossed almost the full width of Schleswig-Holstein. In the 1970s, these fast passenger trains were operated mostly with class 515 <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars.</b> They stopped between Neumünster and Ascheberg only in Wankendorf and recorded a travel time of 20 minutes on this section, while the local trains took about 28 minutes. These trains mostly ran as railcars, but some were locomotive-hauled. Some passenger trains were bound for places off the main route.|$|R
5000|$|Vétra {{was founded}} in 1925 and was based in Paris. After {{initially}} experimenting with production of <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars,</b> the company made its first trolleybus in 1927. The first Vétra trolleybuses were two vehicles, model MV, supplied to the Aubagne-Cuges trolleybus system, which was located just east of Marseille and began operation on 22 September 1927. [...] In the decades that followed, Vétra had a near-monopoly on French trolleybus production. Trolleybus systems operating in France also bought their fleets nearly exclusively from Vétra. From the 1930s through the 1950s, the [...] "overwhelming majority" [...] of trolleybuses in use on French systems were built by Vétra. On a smaller scale, the company also sold trolleybuses to systems located in other countries.|$|R
50|$|High-speed trains diesel-hydraulic {{multiple}} units of classes VT 08 and VT 12.5 were operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Class 515 <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> occasionally operated {{on the line}} from 1956 to 1989. Class VT 24 diesel {{multiple units}} operated some local services from 1964 to 1980. Class 628 DMUs operated school transport around noon from the 1980s onwards. Class 220 diesel-hydraulic locomotives hauled services between the Neustadt and Hochspeyer from 1967 to 1973. Some of the freight trains, which in the past ran between Ludwigshafen and Schifferstadt and between Neustadt and Hochspeyer were hauled by class 212 and 218 diesel locomotives. Diesel locomotives of classes V 60 and V 90 are used for the operation of the sidings that are not electrified. A private works locomotive is used for the shunting in Neidelfels. In St. Ingbert, a private company operates a diesel locomotive imported from the Czech Republic.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{a single}} daily pair of {{services}} ran between Heide and Neustadt and six pairs of stopping services operated. The express train stopped between Eutin and Neustadt only in Bujendorf. Its travel time was 19 minutes, while the stopping trains took about 22 minutes. Services were operated mainly by class 515 <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> and class 798 Uerdingen railbuses, {{but there were}} also locomotive-hauled trains. Around 1976 there was a pair of express trains on the Kiel-Puttgarden route, which operated in summer. In 1980. “Trans-Europ-Express-Marchandises” international freight trains operated of the Hamburg-Eidelstedt-Neumünster-Eutin-Neustadt-Puttgarden route. Finally in October 1981, long-distance trains on the Lübeck-Puttgarden railway were diverted via the line. On 22 May 1982, passenger services were closed on the line. Freight traffic was closed on 31 December 1982 (according to other sources on 30 December 1983 or 3 June 1984). The tracks were removed in 1984/85. In the town of Eutin there are still tracks to a tank loading facility at the local army barracks, but they have not been used for years.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the Class 628 began {{as far back as}} the early 1970s, when the Class 795 and 798 railbuses were reaching the end of their estimated useful life. The Bundesbahn's central office (Bundesbahn-Zentralamt) in Munich, in cooperation with the Waggonfabrik Uerdingen, began with the concept of a Class 628 local, passenger, multiple-unit, that were to replace the railbuses, the <b>accumulator</b> <b>railcars</b> of Class 515. The new vehicles were also to be capable of being used on main lines, which required an increase in their top speed, stronger brake systems and greater comfort compared with the railbuses, but which were not to be more expensive to run than a railbus. In 1974, only 2 years later, Waggonfabrik Uerdingen and MaK demonstrated the prototypes of the two-unit Class 628.0 and also a single-coach variant, the Class 627, for use on routes with lower numbers of passengers. The vehicles were tested and proved themselves exceptionally well, even though the lack of the power from the engines was already apparent on occasions. Initially it did not go into production, because for political reasons local passenger rail services were just being reorganised and it was not yet clear, which and how many vehicles would be needed. So the Class 628 project stalled for almost four years.|$|R
50|$|Railcars {{were only}} used in limited numbers on Saxon railways. The only regular and {{long-lasting}} use of railcars were the electric units on the Klingenthal-Sachsenberg-Georgenthal narrow gauge line. There were trials with steam <b>railcars,</b> <b>accumulator</b> cars and combustion-engined railbuses. Employed {{for a long}} time from 1883 were three Thomas steam railbuses. Two diesel-electrics purchased in 1915 proved themselves well in practice, but were sold to Switzerland after the First World War.|$|R
