30|$|From {{worldwide}} {{application point}} of view, DC <b>system,</b> low-frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> <b>system,</b> and industrial frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> are three {{main power supply}} systems for trunk railways, metros, and light rails. Each of them has its own characteristics and some comparative advantages changing {{with the development of}} electrotechnics [1]. Today, except the low-frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> still being used in trunk railways in Germany and some of its neighborhood countries, the DC system and the industrial frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> have been mainly used around the world. The DC system is mainly used for metros and light railways, while the industrial frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> is mostly for trunk railways [2, 3, 4], both with an increasing automation level [4, 5, 6].|$|R
25|$|The early systems used a low {{frequency}} (Hz), and {{a relatively low}} voltage (3,000 or 3,600 volts) compared with later <b>AC</b> <b>systems.</b> The system provides regenerative braking with the power fed back to the system, so it is particularly suitable for mountain railways provided the supply grid or another locomotive on the line can accept the power.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Russian {{engineer}} Pavel Yablochkov {{invented a}} lighting system where sets of induction coils were installed along a high voltage AC line. Instead of changing voltage, the primary windings transferred {{power to the}} secondary windings which were connected to one or several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design, used to keep the failure of one lamp from disabling the entire circuit. In 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.|$|E
25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early <b>AC</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{methodology}} {{is presented to}} optimize the dc voltage droop settings in a multiterminal voltage-source converter high-voltage direct-current system {{with respect to the}} <b>ac</b> <b>system</b> stability. Implementing dc voltage droop control enables having multiple converters assisting the system in case of a converter outage. However, the abrupt power setpoint changes create additional stress in the <b>ac</b> <b>system,</b> especially when multiple converters are connected to the same interconnected <b>ac</b> <b>system.</b> This paper presents {{a methodology}} to determine optimizd converter droop settings in order to not compromise the <b>ac</b> <b>system</b> stability, thereby taking into account the adverse effect the droop control actions have on the interconnected <b>ac</b> <b>system.</b> Developing a disturbance model of the interconnected ac/dc system, the principal directions indicate the gain and directionality of the disturbances; from this, optimal droop settings are derived to minimize the disturbance gain. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReducing energy {{consumption}} and ensuring thermal comfort are two important considerations in designing an air conditioning (<b>AC)</b> <b>system.</b> An <b>AC</b> <b>system,</b> originally operated on an on/off control mechanism, was retrofitted {{to enable the}} application of the new controllers. This paper deals with independent control methods for the <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> based on the thermostat on/off control, digital on/off control, digital on/off control with a personal computer (DPC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC). Measurements were made at a time interval of one minute for set point temperatures of 22, 23 and 24 oC. The room air temperature, {{energy consumption}} and energy saving were analyzed for all control methods. The main objective is to determine the amount of energy savings when digital on/off control, DPC and FLC are applied to the <b>AC</b> <b>system.</b> The experimental results showed that these controls saved energy consumption and improved indoor comfort significantly for a building <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> compared to a thermostat on/off control method...|$|R

50|$|The task of {{designing}} AC harmonic filters for HVDC converter stations {{is complex and}} computationally intensive, since in addition to ensuring that the converter does not produce an unacceptable level of voltage distortion on the <b>AC</b> <b>system,</b> it must be ensured that the harmonic filters do not resonate with some component elsewhere in the <b>AC</b> <b>system.</b> A detailed knowledge of the harmonic impedance of the <b>AC</b> <b>system,</b> at {{a wide range of}} frequencies, is needed in order to design the AC filters.|$|R
40|$|A dynamic {{mathematical}} model based on anaerobic digestion model no. 1 (ADM 1) {{was developed for}} accumulation (<b>AC)</b> <b>system</b> treating concentrated black water and faecal matter at different temperatures.

For evaluation of the <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> treating the proposed waste(water) sources at 20 and 35 °C, two options were studied: (1) The filling period of the <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> was constant for all waste(water) sources (either 1, 3 or 6 months) and for each period, the seed sludge volume was varied; (2) The volume of the <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> was constant for all proposed waste(water) sources.

2500|$|In the US William Stanley, Jr. {{designed}} one of {{the first}} practical devices to transfer AC power efficiently between isolated circuits. Using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core, his design, called an induction coil, was an early (1885) transformer. Stanley also worked on engineering and adapting European designs such as the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for US entrepreneur George Westinghouse who started building <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> in 1886. The spread of Westinghouse and other <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> triggered a push back in late 1887 by Edison (a proponent of direct current) who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the [...] "War of Currents". In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional AC motor, something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an induction motor, was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). This design was further developed into the modern practical three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown.|$|E
2500|$|The {{competition}} between AC and DC {{came to a}} head during the development of the potential of Niagara Falls because <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> could supply electricity over much longer distances than DC systems. This was enormously important to Canada, which had numerous potential hydroelectric sites in remote locations. In 1897 a transmission system was built from the Batiscan River [...] to Trois-Rivières, Quebec. In 1901 Shawinigan Falls was harnessed, and by 1903 a 50,000 volt power line carried electricity from it to Montreal.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2012, {{both the}} line-commutated and voltage-source {{technologies}} are important, with line-commutated converters used mainly where very high capacity and efficiency are needed, and voltage-source converters used mainly for interconnecting weak <b>AC</b> <b>systems,</b> for connecting large-scale wind {{power to the}} grid or for HVDC interconnections {{that are likely to}} be expanded to become Multi-terminal HVDC systems in future.

2500|$|Edison {{expressed}} {{views that}} AC was unworkable {{and the high}} voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, [...] "Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts {{in a system of}} any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically." [...] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general. Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.|$|E

2500|$|In 1891 Westinghouse built a {{hydroelectric}} AC power plant, the Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant. The plant supplied {{power to}} the Gold King Mine 3.5 miles away. This was the first successful demonstration of long-distance transmission of industrial-grade alternating current power and used two 100hp Westinghouse alternators, one working as a generator producing 3000-volt, 133-Hertz, single-phase AC, and the other used as an AC motor. At the beginning of 1893 Westinghouse engineer Benjamin Lamme had made great progress developing an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor and Westinghouse Electric started branding their complete polyphase AC system as the [...] "Tesla Polyphase System", announcing Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> and their intentions to sue patent infringers.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{interurban}} railways in North America {{were constructed}} {{using the same}} low-voltage 500 to 600 V DC [...] trolley power in use by the street railways to which they connected. This enabled interurban cars {{to use the same}} overhead trolley power on town street car tracks with no electrical change on the cars to accommodate a different voltage. However, higher voltage became necessary to reduce power loss on long-distance routes, though substations were established to boost voltage. In 1904, a high voltage single-phase alternating current (AC) system where AC was delivered directly to the interurban car became available and was promoted and distributed by Westinghouse and competitor General Electric. Both 3300 and 6600 V AC were used. However, <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> proved expensive to maintain and were not widely adopted.|$|E
2500|$|As Edison {{expanded}} his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (<b>AC)</b> <b>systems.</b> From the early 1880s AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces {{had been an}} expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and [...] "step down" [...] the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC {{to be used in}} street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply. Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving {{a large part of the}} market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.|$|E
