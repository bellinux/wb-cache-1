25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in {{manufacturing}} practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information {{on the effect of}} product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for <b>audited</b> <b>accounts</b> that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the effect of analytical review results on auditors' effort of <b>auditing</b> <b>accounting</b> estimates. Other objectives involve examining the moderating effect of personality traits (optimism), patterns-for-coping (vigilance), and level of experience on auditors' effort of <b>auditing</b> <b>accounting</b> estimates. In examining the effects of optimism and vigilance on <b>auditing</b> <b>accounting</b> estimates, the study makes a significant original contribution to the extant literature in audit judgement. The subjects were public accountants at different levels from both Big Six as well as non-Big Six firms. The findings of the study indicate that auditors' perceptions to extend tests of details related to the balances of the accounting estimates, according to the audit hours allocated to the budgeted time plan, did vary significantly across treatment groups. The analytical review results and the two dimensions of the individual psychological differences influenced their confidence in their assignment of the audit effort. Analytical review results were found to affect the <b>audit</b> plan for <b>accounting</b> estimates when these results signaled fluctuations. However, the conservatism tendency found by previous studies {{was found to be}} valid in this study. Optimism dimension was significant in moderating auditors' judgement yet vigilance and experience level were inconclusive in their influence...|$|R
