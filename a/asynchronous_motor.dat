50|$|Boucherot was {{interested}} in using polyphase supplies to power asynchronous motors as early as 1894. The squirrel-cage rotor <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motor</b> was invented by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889 and they were being built industrially from 1891. A problem with asynchronous machines {{is that they are}} difficult to start. The coupling to the rotor is weak until it gets moving and the current drawn by the motor is high. Boucherot solved this problem with his discovery of the double cage <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motor</b> in 1912. In fact, Dolivo-Dobrovolsky had already invented the double cage all the way back in 1893 but it was long since forgotten.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to solving the {{critical}} task of improving {{the reliability of the}} power systems for agricultural processing plants. The article’s material is exploratory in nature, reflected {{in the fact that the}} proposed mathematical models for the analysis of groups of high-voltage induction motors will allow to investigate various modes of symmetric groups of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motors</b> more effectively. We present the analysis of the existing mathematical models of induction motors considering the design features of such machines that directly affect the dependence of resistance and inductance on the rotor current frequency. The assumptions taken into consideration to obtain a more accurate mathematical model of the induction motor are also formulated. The article provides a comparison of different reference frames used in the mathematical modeling of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motors.</b> It is proved that the use of the generalized coordinate vector for mathematical modeling of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motors</b> is the most optimal approach. The equivalent circuit of <b>asynchronous</b> deep-bar <b>motor</b> in generalized vector coordinates derived in the work is used for analysis of transient behavior as well as the steady state operation.
