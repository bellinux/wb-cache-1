5|$|The book {{debuted in}} America on November 7, 1960 {{during the week}} of John Kennedy's election. At the time of the book's release, Neill was unknown in the United States, and not a single {{bookseller}} purchased an <b>advance</b> <b>copy.</b> Summerhill brought him international renown over the next decade. The book sold 24,000 copies in its first year, 100 thousand in 1968, 200 thousand in 1969, two million total by 1970, and three million by 1973. Summerhill was included in over 600 American university courses, and a 1969 translation for West Germany (The Theory and Practice of Anti-Authoritarian Education) sold over a million copies in three years. In the wake of the book's success, publisher Harold Hart started the American Summerhill Society in New York City, of which Paul Goodman was a founding member.|$|E

5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an <b>advance</b> <b>copy.</b> They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

A month later Armitage claimed Fitzgerald had instructed him not {{to go public with}} this information. Journalist Michael Isikoff received confirmation from Rove's lawyer and from lobbyist Richard F. Hohlt that Rove was also faxed an <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of the article revealing a CIA covert agent's identity several days before it was published.|$|E

5000|$|After {{sending out}} <b>advance</b> <b>copies</b> {{of the season}} premiere to the media, Matthew Weiner was angered by what he {{considered}} spoilers in subsequent reviews. As a result, <b>advance</b> <b>copies</b> were not issued for later episodes. James Poniewozik, in his television blog for Time magazine, called AMC and Weiner's handling of the matter [...] "insane". The channel released a promotional clip from the third episode containing a major plot detail, so in Poniewozik's opinion, they were contradicting the spoiler policy {{they were trying to}} force on others.|$|R
25|$|De Gaulle {{landed at}} Heston Airport soon after 12.30pm on 17 June. He visited Churchill at 10 Downing Street at around 3pm and {{discussed}} making a radio broadcast, {{although it was}} agreed to postpone such a speech until after Pétain's imminent broadcast had been made. Pétain’s broadcast later that day stated openly that “the fighting must end” {{and that he had}} approached the Germans for terms; that evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced Pétain’s “treason”. The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as it was the day of his “Finest Hour” speech) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a radio address via the BBC Radio service, as Britain was still interceding with the Pétain government about the fate of the French fleet. Contrary to de Gaulle’s later claims, several eyewitnesses agree that Duff Cooper (Minister of Information) had an <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of the text, to which there were no objections. The Cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the Cabinet minutes.|$|E
500|$|On October 4, 2009 a {{digitally}} watermarked <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of Axe to Fall had leaked {{onto the}} internet. The watermark {{was linked to}} the <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> given to Shaun Hand, a staff member of the music news and reviews website MetalSucks.net. Converge posted a number of Twitter messages regarding the leak, one of which read, [...] "Special thanks to Shaun Hand at Metal Sucks for leaking our album," [...] and another one was posted shortly thereafter directed at MetalSucks' Twitter account stating, [...] "have fun with that." [...] The source of an album leak is rarely discovered or publicly announced. Converge's method of dealing with their album leaking, referred to as [...] "street justice" [...] by Every Time I Die and Jamey Jasta, avoided a costly lawsuit yet still inflicted damages upon MetalSucks by means of viral negative publicity. The staff at MetalSucks issued a formal apology, stating that the leak was completely unintentional and the first incident since the website's inception. They went on to say: ...|$|E

A group of Pound's friends—Eliot, Cummings, W. H. Auden, Allen Tate, and Julien Cornell—met Laughlin to discuss how to get him released. They planned to have Pound awarded the first Bollingen Prize, a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the Mellon family.|$|E
500|$|By 1961 Fleming had {{published}} nine James Bond books. The most recent {{of these was}} Thunderball, a novel Fleming initially published under his own name, but which {{was the subject of}} a legal action by its co-authors, Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. In March 1961, McClory read an <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of the book and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the High Court in London for an injunction to stop publication. The case was heard on 24 March 1961 and allowed the book to be published, although the door was left open for McClory to pursue further action at a later date.|$|E
500|$|An <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of {{the episode}} was {{released}} to several reviewers, and received a highly enthusiastic response. Once the episode aired many others were equally impressed, though not all. Brittany's (Heather Morris) [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] performance was hailed, and the entire Mike Chang storyline, especially his rendition of [...] "Cool" [...] and his initial solo dance sequence, also received favorable notice. The musical numbers were generally greeted positively, among them the three that featured Mercedes, particularly [...] "It's All Over". However, her storyline had its detractors, mostly due to the recurrence of the Mercedes versus Rachel plot, and the inconsistency of her characterization with past appearances.|$|E

500|$|Working at Goldeneye between January and March 1960, Fleming {{wrote the}} novel Thunderball, {{based on the}} {{screenplay}} written by himself, Whittingham and McClory. In March 1961 McClory read an <b>advance</b> <b>copy,</b> and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the High Court in London for an injunction to stop publication. After two court actions, the second in November 1961, Fleming offered McClory a deal, settling out of court. McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay, while Fleming was given {{the rights to the}} novel, provided it was acknowledged as [...] "based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author".|$|E
500|$|Rockstar Games co-founder Terry Donovan responded, saying [...] "I {{would prefer}} {{it if we}} could simply make great games {{and not have to}} deal with {{misunderstanding}} and misperception of what we do." [...] After receiving no response from Rockstar regarding an <b>advance</b> <b>copy,</b> Thompson filed the public nuisance complaint against Wal-Mart, Take-Two Interactive, and GameStop, demanding that he be allowed to preview the game before its October 17 release date. Take-Two offered to bring in a copy and let both Judge Ronald Friedman and Thompson view the game in the judge's chambers on October 12, 2006. The judge ultimately saw no reason to restrict sales and dismissed the complaint the next day.|$|E
500|$|U.S. President Barack Obama quipped {{about his}} {{interest}} in an <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of the second series: [...] "I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient ... It's true. I was looking at Kevin Spacey thinking, 'this guy's {{getting a lot of}} stuff done'." [...] The evening before the season was posted, someone responsible for the @BarackObama Twitter account (which is run by Organizing for Action) tweeted a request that no spoilers be posted online. Since the season debuted on Valentine's Day, The New York Observer created themed cards in honor of the series with quotes such as [...] "A great man once said everything is about sex. Except sex. Sex is about power" [...] (an Oscar Wilde quote Underwood had stated during season 1).|$|E

500|$|When it was released, {{critics were}} split {{between those who}} thought the album was a masterpiece, the {{beginnings}} of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative. The album had a hostile reception with the BBC and certain US radio stations, with Tony Blackburn describing [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] as [...] "distasteful". Nevertheless, BBC Radio 1 received an <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on Pete Drummond's show on 3 May. Townshend promoted the album's release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of Baba's spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradicting details.|$|E
500|$|Still {{hoping for}} {{reconciliation}} with Germany, Chamberlain {{made a major}} speech in Birmingham on 28 January 1939 in which he expressed his desire for international peace, and had an <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> sent to Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Hitler seemed to respond; in his [...] "Reichstag" [...] speech on 30 January 1939, he stated that he wanted a [...] "long peace". Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table. This belief was reinforced by a German official's conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain. Chamberlain responded with a speech in Blackburn on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade, and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers. With matters appearing to improve Chamberlain's rule over the House of Commons was firm and he was convinced the government would [...] "romp home" [...] in a late 1939 election.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} public in early 2005 {{that the book}} would be published, representatives of Morrison {{contacted}} the publishers of the book.

When the news broke {{earlier this year that}} the book was being published, his lawyers asked to see an <b>advance</b> <b>copy</b> of the manuscript. The publishers refused the request. But then {{this is a man who}} when he learnt that there was going to be a plaque erected outside his former Belfast home, got his solicitors to write to the Belfast Telegraph dissociating himself from the tribute." [...] The book was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg, and a 2006 edition was published by Vintage Books. Johnny Rogan appeared on a panel of experts in the 2008 documentary Van Morrison: Under Review 1964–1974, along with Steve Turner, author of the 1993 biography [...]|$|E

50|$|McClelland {{realized}} that censorship {{would be a}} problem in Canada, and tried to soften the blow with advance publicity via <b>advance</b> <b>copies.</b> The responses from the readers of the <b>advance</b> <b>copies</b> were too negative for him to use, however. A gala lunch was thrown a month in advance of the book's release, and about four hundred of the top names in the Canadian arts world appeared there. Posters had Cohen in a turtleneck and jacket in the hopes that such a sober pose would offset the anticipated scandal. The University of Toronto, which had started collecting Cohen's papers starting in 1964, paid Cohen $6,000 for the original manuscript.|$|R
