5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not <b>always</b> <b>make</b> consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E

25|$|By {{building}} on Wehrung's abovementioned work on dimension vector spaces, Ploščica and Tůma proved that WURP {{does not hold}} in G(Ω), for any set Ω of cardinality at least ℵ2. Hence G(Ω) does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. It is to be noted that all negative representation results mentioned here <b>always</b> <b>make</b> use of some uniform refinement property, including the first one about dimension vector spaces.|$|E

25|$|A spinners weasel {{is similar}} to a swift, however it does not adjust to various sized hanks. While today this is a big disadvantage, as {{different}} manufacturers don't <b>always</b> <b>make</b> hanks the same size, it was not an issue when all yarn was hand spun. At this time hanks from one spinner would all be the same size, as they would have been made on the same niddy noddy, thus only one diameter was needed.|$|E
25|$|Galef popularized {{the concept}} of Straw Vulcan, the {{incorrect}} perception about rationality {{as a way of}} thinking that denies emotions such as love and lacks appreciations for beauty. It refers to the fictional character Mr. Spock (a half-Vulcan) in Star Trek, who is often seen as a poster child for this caricature of rationality. On the contrary, Galef argues that Mr. Spock's failure to adjust his thinking, even though he experiences that humans do not <b>always</b> <b>make</b> rational decisions, is a case of irrationality. In 2011, Galef gave a talk on this subject at Skepticon.|$|E
25|$|Under Hart, the Bulldogs won {{just seven}} games {{in his first}} two years, but had one notable moment of glory when Kelvin Templeton won the Brownlow medal in 1980. Hart had taken on Templeton, a century-goalkicker who was seen as a little bit brittle, as a {{personal}} project, getting him on a weight program and moving him to his old position at centre half forward. It seemed that Hart worked well with those who were similarly talented and motivated as himself, but struggled to relate to those who were not. This is a common refrain in Australian football: simply put, the best players don't <b>always</b> <b>make</b> the best coaches.|$|E

25|$|The first {{documented}} {{description of}} a peer review process {{is found in the}} Ethics of the Physician written by Ishaq bin Ali al-Rahwi (854–931) of al-Raha, Syria, who describes the first medical peer review process. His work, as well as later Arabic medical manuals, state that a visiting physician must <b>always</b> <b>make</b> duplicate notes of a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would review the practising physician's notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient.|$|E
25|$|King Amadeus {{made him}} prince of Vergara. The Restoration caused a statue {{to him to}} be built near {{the gate of the}} Retiro Park in Madrid. A {{magnificent}} statue and fountain was raised in his memory at Logrono. Spaniards of all political factions, except Carlists and Ultramontanes, paid homage to his memory when he died at his La Rioja on 8 January 1879. His preferences were modest, his manners rather reserved but always kind and considerate of humble folk. He was a typical Spanish soldier-politician but had more of the better traits of the soldier born and bred than of the arts of the statesman. His military traits did not <b>always</b> <b>make</b> it easy for him to accommodate himself to courtiers and professional politicians.|$|E
25|$|In two dimensions, {{if one of}} the {{coordinates}} in a point coordinate system is held constant and the other coordinate is allowed to vary, then the resulting curve is called a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system the coordinate curves are, in fact, straight lines, thus coordinate lines. Specifically, they are the lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes. For other coordinate systems {{the coordinates}} curves may be general curves. For example, the coordinate curves in polar coordinates obtained by holding r constant are the circles with center at the origin. Coordinates systems for Euclidean space other than the Cartesian coordinate system are called curvilinear coordinate systems. This procedure does not <b>always</b> <b>make</b> sense, for example there are no coordinate curves in a homogeneous coordinate system.|$|E

25|$|Miley is {{especially}} close with her father, from whom she receives much good advice and emotional support. She also values her relationships with her best friends Lilly and Oliver. However Miley {{is shown to}} be very uncomfortable {{with the fact that}} they're dating and even stops them from being a couple. Her relationship with Lilly occasionally suffers the occasional setback, but they <b>always</b> <b>make</b> up. In the episode 'What I Don't Like About You', Miley is asked to choose a side between a fight Lilly and Oliver had. But Miley, showing what a kind friend she was, made a mini-Indiana Joannie movie, which made Lilly and Oliver forgive each other. Miley's relationship with her brother Jackson is often hostile. The two siblings constantly fight and trash talk each other. However, in a few private conversations, both Miley and Jackson say that they love and appreciate each other, but they are both unwilling to admit this in public.|$|E
25|$|Mickey Mouse {{was created}} as a {{replacement}} for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an earlier cartoon character created by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz, a film producer who distributed product through Universal Studios. In the spring of 1928, with the series going strong, Disney asked Mintz for an increase in the budget. But Mintz instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent budget cut, and as leverage, he reminded Disney that Universal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney's current employees to his new contract. Angrily, Disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz. Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch. The new Disney Studio initially consisted of animator Ub Iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist, Les Clark, who together with Wilfred Jackson were among the few who remained loyal to Walt. One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter <b>always</b> <b>make</b> sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company.|$|E

500|$|Peter Hall said of Richardson, [...] "I {{think he}} was the {{greatest}} actor I have ever worked with." [...] The director David Ayliff, son of Richardson's and Olivier's mentor, said, [...] "Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination." [...] Comparing the two, Hobson said that Olivier always made the audience feel inferior, and Richardson always made them feel superior. The actor Edward Hardwicke agreed, saying that audiences were in awe of Olivier, [...] "whereas Ralph would <b>always</b> <b>make</b> you feel sympathy... you wanted {{to give him a}} big hug. But they were both giants." ...|$|E
500|$|David Reinhard of The Oregonian {{commented on}} the criticism: [...] "Hollywood sharpsters can <b>always</b> <b>make</b> a group from the great American {{hinterland}} look ridiculous when it zeroes in on one show, particularly if that show is a cartoon. And the Oregon Lands Coalition's protest {{was a bit of}} an overreaction. But the environmental sloganeering of The Simpsons as well as Groening's cartoon commentary are symptomatic of a Hollywood and a popular culture that are hostile to the concerns and values of most Americans." [...] After the episode aired, media researchers Robert Lichter and Linda S. Lichter found in a study of prime-time television that when shows dealt with business themes, 89 percent portrayed businessmen as swindlers or liars.|$|E
500|$|After high school, Barbette {{began his}} circus career as {{one-half}} of the aerialist team The Alfaretta Sisters. One of the sisters had died unexpectedly and Barbette answered the surviving sister's ad for a replacement, auditioning in San Antonio. Together the pair {{decided that it was}} more dramatic for a woman to perform the acrobatic stunts. [...] "She told me that women's clothes <b>always</b> <b>make</b> a wire act more impressive...and she asked me if I'd mind dressing as a girl. I didn't; and that's how it began." [...] Following his time as an Alfaretta, Barbette next joined an act called Erford's Whirling Sensation. This act included three people who hung from a spinning apparatus by their teeth.|$|E

500|$|Callaway {{carefully}} chose actors when casting each role. He {{focused on}} maintaining the series as a [...] "character-driven plot", to <b>always</b> <b>make</b> [...] "what {{is going on}} with people's hearts and minds" [...] more important than special effects. Despite auditioning other actors to voice Hippocrates, Callway reprised the role from the pilot; he would later say that he had difficulty with the medical and technical vocabulary required for the character. Like The X-Files and Stargate SG-1, the show was filmed in Vancouver to take advantage of lower production costs. A majority of the crew had worked on The X-Files. The executive producers were: Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders. Jon Ehrlich composed the show's theme.|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals <b>always</b> <b>make</b> me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea Gough and Millar came up {{with for}} their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his [...] "... bare essence ...", {{discovering}} the reasons why Clark became Superman. In Smallville, Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't <b>always</b> <b>make</b> the right decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El {{at the end of}} season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die. Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.|$|E
