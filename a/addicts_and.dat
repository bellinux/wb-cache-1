5|$|In 2001, Ed Harris {{directed}} Connelly in the biopic Pollock {{in which}} she played Ruth Kligman, Jackson Pollock's mistress. In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film, Requiem for a Dream, directed by Darren Aronofsky {{and based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Connelly played Marion Silver, the girlfriend of Harry, played by Jared Leto; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop. She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution. Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. During her time in the apartment, Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin. Connelly also talked to <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery. Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation. Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the problem}} of hard drugs in Dublin had been {{controlled}} somewhat, prior to the 2008 recession, through methadone programmes for <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> better economic prospects for young people, {{it is by no}} means a thing of the past. As of 2011, heroin addiction and homelessness are huge problems across the inner city of Dublin.|$|E

Set in the early 70s, it {{tells the story of}} the protagonist, a fourteen-year-old runaway named Bobbie, transforming from a meth <b>addict</b> <b>and</b> amateur thief to a heroin <b>addict</b> <b>and</b> accomplished safe-cracker, with the help of his mentor Mel.|$|R
25|$|Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-86, August 10, 1973) {{required}} States {{to expand}} the program to every political jurisdiction before July 1, 1974; expanded the program to drug <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> alcoholics in treatment and rehabilitation centers; established semi-annual allotment adjustments, SSI cash-out, and bi-monthly issuance; introduced statutory complexity in the income definition (by including in-kind payments and providing an accompanying exception); and required the Department to establish temporary eligibility standards for disasters.|$|E
25|$|In 1927 Sakel, who had {{recently}} qualified as a doctor in Vienna and was working in a psychiatric clinic in Berlin, began to use low (sub-coma) doses of insulin to treat drug <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> psychopaths. Having returned to Vienna, he treated schizophrenic patients with larger doses of insulin {{in order to produce}} coma and sometimes convulsions. Sakel made public his results in 1933 and his methods were soon taken up by other psychiatrists.|$|E
25|$|Lee's {{government}} inherited judicial {{corporal punishment}} from British rule, but greatly expanded its scope. Under the British, {{it had been}} used as a penalty for offences involving personal violence, amounting to a handful of caning sentences per year. The PAP government under Lee extended its use to an ever-expanding range of crimes. By 1993 it was mandatory for 42 offences and optional for a further 42. Those routinely ordered by the courts to be caned now include drug <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> illegal immigrants. From 602 canings in 1987, the figure rose to 3,244 in 1993 and to 6,404 in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Further {{examples}} of Townshend's drug rehabilitation activism {{took place in}} the form of a 1984 benefit concert (incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band The Stone Roses), an article he wrote a few days later for Britain's Mail on Sunday urging better care for the nation's growing number of drug <b>addicts,</b> <b>and</b> the formation of a charitable organisation, Double-O Charities, to raise funds for the causes he'd recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fund-raising anti-heroin T-shirts at a series of UK Bruce Springsteen concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former Clash drummer Topper Headon to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshend's 1985–86 band, Deep End, played two benefits at Brixton Academy in 1985 for Double-O Charities.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 series Robotech is {{most often}} {{credited}} as the catalyst for the Western interest in anime. The series inspired a few fanzines such as Protoculture <b>Addicts</b> <b>and</b> Animag both of which in turn promoted interest in the wide world of anime in general. Anime's first notable appearance at SF or comic book conventions was {{in the form of}} video showings of popular anime, untranslated and often low quality VHS bootlegs. Starting in the 1990s, anime fans began organizing conventions. These quickly grew to sizes much larger than other science fiction and media conventions in the same communities; many cities now have anime conventions attracting five to ten thousand attendees. Many anime conventions are a hybrid between non-profit and commercial events, with volunteer organizers handling large revenue streams and dealing with commercial suppliers and professional marketing campaigns.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to health-related matters, Diana's extensive charity work included campaigning for animal protection and her {{fight against the}} use of landmines. She was the patroness of charities and organisations working with the homeless, youth, drug <b>addicts,</b> <b>and</b> the elderly. From 1989, she was president of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. From 1991 to 1996, she was a patron of Headway, a brain injury association. She was patron of Natural History Museum and president of Royal Academy of Music. From 1984 to 1996, she was president of Barnardo's, a charity founded by Dr. Thomas John Barnardo in 1866 to care for vulnerable children and young people. In 1988, she became patron of the British Red Cross and supported its organisations in other countries such as Australia and Canada. She made several lengthy visits each week to Royal Brompton Hospital, where she worked to comfort seriously ill or dying patients. In 1992, she became the first patron of Chester Childbirth Appeal, a charity that she had supported since 1984. The charity, which is named after one of Diana's royal titles, could raise over £1 million with her help.|$|E

Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.|$|E
500|$|Modern street {{newspapers}} {{began to}} emerge in the United States in the late 1980s in response to increasing levels of homelessness and homeless advocates' dissatisfaction with the mainstream media's portrayals of the homeless. At the time, many media outlets portrayed homeless people as being all criminals and drug <b>addicts,</b> <b>and</b> suggested that homelessness was a result of laziness rather than societal or political factors. [...] Thus, one motivation for the creation of the first street newspapers was to counter the negative coverage of homeless people that was coming from existing media.|$|E

500|$|Multiple crimes have {{occurred}} in Forest Park, including two murders. [...] In 2001, a man who preyed on heroin <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> prostitutes pleaded guilty to the 1999 murders of three women whose bodies were found in Forest Park near Northwest Saltzman Road, though forensic analysis showed the murders took place elsewhere and the bodies were brought to Forest Park. In 2003, jurors convicted another man of the 1996 murder of his ex-girlfriend on a Forest Park trail. Less serious crimes have included assault (rarely), car break-ins and petty theft (frequently at trail heads), rare arsons, rare indecent exposure, and marijuana cultivation. Multnomah County Sheriff's deputies in 2007 seized 114mature marijuana plants found growing in the park on a hillside near Portland's Linnton neighborhood. Deputies had seized another small grow operation in the park in 2005. [...] More common has been illegal camping by homeless transients and others. An illegal bicycling trail, about [...] long, was discovered in a remote part of the park in February 2010. In 2014, hikers found a booby trap meant to fire a shotgun shell across a path leading to the park. Portland police removed the device.|$|E
500|$|Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{pointed out}} that {{although}} the episode mocked drug <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> handicapped children, it did not face the kind of censorship [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201" [...] did, which he suggested proved that censorship was born of fear rather than ethics. Delgado also said the comparison of handicapped children to Looney Tunes characters [...] "should remind us all that such cruel portrayals of disabled people {{have been going on}} for years". Others criticized the episode. MTV writer Adam Rosenberg thought the episode [...] "just wasn't very funny", and said it missed an opportunity to continue the creative edginess demonstrated in [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201". Rosenberg found the jokes about handicapped children [...] "pointlessly mean", and said {{the fact that they are}} allowed where depictions of Muhammad are censored [...] "makes a point about the absurdity of what is and isn't TV-acceptable". The television website TV Fanatic praised the Towelie storyline and the use of his son [...] "Washcloth", but said the jokes about the handicapped children were unfunny and irritating. The site called it [...] "by far the weakest of the season" [...] and a disappointment following [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201".|$|E
500|$|Kennel {{was born}} in 1925 to a Mennonite family who lived in Chassey-Beaupré. His father was a farmer and mayor of the city, and Kennel was {{expected}} to run the family farm when he was older. At age20, Kennel developed an interest in pastoral ministry and attended theological training at the Bible Institute of Nogent-sur-Marne in 1945–46, training that was later completed by studies at the European Mennonite Bible School in 1948–49. While still a farmer, he became a Mennonite missionary in the Meuse, Marne and Haute-Marne departments. In 1960, he discovered Pentecostalism through Roma missions, notably the Life and Light Evangelical Roma Mission (Mission Évangélique Tsigane [...] "Vie et Lumière"); he was attracted to this form of Christianity, since it emphasized missionary zeal and legitimized his ministry. He founded an evangelical group in his city, which caused conflict with his family, other religious leaders and his neighbors. In the early 1960s, Kennel became pastor of the church at Joinville; he conducted humanitarian activities on his farm, providing relief to homeless, former prisoners, drug <b>addicts</b> <b>and</b> alcoholics. In 1964, he also directed the church of Saint-Dizier; three years later, he decided to give up farming to fully devote himself to religious activities. In 1975 he was appointed treasurer of the Federation of Free Evangelical Pentecostals, and elected president seven years later. Under Kennel's leadership of the Pentecostal Church of Besançon, the church quickly opened many places of worship in Northern and Eastern France; Kennel trained pastors among his converts (including his son Étienne, who was ordained in 1981), {{and sent them to}} direct the new assemblies. In 1989 Kennel legally registered the Evangelical Missionary Federation, whose purpose was to federate all the churches (then composed of over thirty pastors).|$|E
