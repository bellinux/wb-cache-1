Using auditor salary as a proxy for <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> quality, I hypothesize and find that higher personnel quality leads to better audit output. First, clients of auditors paying higher salaries have higher audit quality, as evidenced by a lower likelihood of a future restatement of current year’s financial statements, lower discretionary accruals, and a lower likelihood to receive a failed internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) opinion. Moreover, higher-paid auditors earn higher audit fees and are more likely to become national and city-level leaders in a specific industry. The cross-sectional analysis finds that the positive effect of personnel quality on audit outcomes is more pronounced for the audit offices having a steady growth in industry market shares. Collectively, these results are consistent with higher-cost audit inputs leading to better audit output...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. Performance {{appraisal}} of employees is traditionally {{one of the}} most criticised human resource management functions. Performance appraisal is however a critical element in the success of especially a service organisation, because the employees are the most important asset in a service organisation. This asset has to be developed and managed to contribute to the achievement ofthe organisation's vision, mission and objectives. Performance appraisal {{is more than just a}} task that is performed once a year. It is a continuous management process. This study focuses specifically on performance {{appraisal of}} <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> and the performance management process of small to medium audit firms. The study identifies the different appraisal methods, criteria for appraisal, the performance management processes and the linking of performance appraisal and reward management. The method of the research that was followed, are a combination of a literature review and a study of appraisal methods, processes and competencies as criteria for appraisals, that are used by different auditing firms. The ranking of importance of the competencies used, as criteria for evaluating <b>audit</b> <b>personnel,</b> by employees and management of small to medium audit firms, were reviewed. Although performance appraisal is often neglected in a small to medium audit firm, it is still an essential component that will facilitate employee development and success of the organisation. The results of the research show that employee development should be the primary goal of performance appraisal and that fairness, honesty and continuous feedback are critical for a successful performance management process...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of outsourcing tax audit work in Malaysian tax system to enhance administration efficiency, to curb tax evasion and abusive avoidance, and to improve revenue collection without introducing a new tax. The current tax audit, carried out by internal auditors of Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia, could only be performed on a small numbers of taxpayers due to high administrative cost in terms of audit cost and cost to employ and train more <b>audit</b> <b>personnel.</b> Nevertheless, without tax audit, tax non-compliance activity could not be curbed and government would be {{at high risk of}} losing its revenue. One of the possible ways to increase audit work is through strategic outsourcing. However, decision to outsource tax work should be critically examined because outsourcing of tax audit is a policy that could potentially affect every taxpayer. This paper discusses the views of the stakeholders (tax authorities, the taxpayers and tax agents) on the value of tax audit outsourcing. Using a mixed method approach, this study finds contradicting opinions on the idea of implementing external tax audit in Malaysia. While the tax authorities are hesitant to the idea, the companies as tax payers and the tax agents show favorable responds to the implementation of outsourced tax audit in Malaysia...|$|E

The study investigated how principals managed the school cash, inventories, account receivables and account payables. The study also aimed at assessing problems principals encountered when applying these financial management practices. The principal and the bursar {{of each of the}} thirty secondary schools were interviewed. Questionnaires with open ended and closed ended questions were used to collect primary data. Secondary data were collected from the District Schools Auditor’s financial records and from the financial records of the sampled schools. Descriptive statistics, especially, the use of frequency tables, percentages and means was used to analyze the data. Scaling method was used, particularly the use of Likert scale, to analyze the views gathered from the respondents. The findings indicated that most schools follow the recommended and acceptable financial management practices as per the Government Financial Regulations. The findings also indicated that the major problems arising from the government financial regulations include lack of monitoring and evaluation unit on financial usage, long procurement procedures, lack of financial management training, late disbursement of funds and lack of <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> in secondary schools. These problems hinder good Financial Management Practices in public secondary schools...|$|E
40|$|Early efforts {{regarding}} {{research on}} a new area of interest are, by nature, exploratory. Before theoretical models can be built and before meaningful empirical research can be performed, a careful process of identifying the appropriate research questions and problems must be undertaken. This is {{the current state of}} research regarding the relatively new area of the continuous audit (CA). Though the concepts of CA have been around for almost a decade, and recent advances have made the technologies both widely available and very affordable, firms have yet to make significant steps toward implementation. Thus, {{there is a need for}} exploratory surveys of key <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> in charge of providing assurance services for major clients to bring to light the issues regarding technology, people, and processes with which auditors and their audit clients are wrestling. This paper discusses the results of a survey of the U. S. assurance partners of a Big 4 accounting firm.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were {{to examine the effects of}} six variables on auditor independence and the reliability of financial statements as perceived within the Irish commercial environment and to explore the reasons underlying these perceptions. The six variables comprised of audit firm size, audit market competition, audit committees, audit tenure, provision of nonaudit services (NAS) and client employment. From a combination of questionnaire and interview approaches, the study sought to obtain supportable and useful insight as to the perceptions held. The approach builds on and develops previous research conducted outside the Irish market. The results of the study showed that auditor independence and the reliability of financial statements were perceived to be significantly impaired when the audit was performed by a non-Big Six firm, the audit environment was highly competitive, no audit committee existed, audit tenure was long, NAS were provided by <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> to audit clients, and the auditor took up an employment position with a former audit client. Some of the reasons underlying these perceptions were as follows. The importance of reputation to, and. the international profile of, the Big Six firms allowed interviewees to have greater confidence in their independence. A highly competitive audit market was perceived to impair auditor independence by encouraging auditors to cut back on the amount of audit work performed in order to maintain audit fee income. Audit committees were perceived to enhance auditor independence by reducing the power that management could exert over the auditor. Long audit tenure was perceived to impair auditor independence by encouraging auditors to become cosy in their relationships with their clients. The lack of confidence as a result of NAS provision was associated with the audit firm's dependency on such services for fee income. Client employment was perceived to provide the ex-auditor with power to influence auditor-client relationships...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{dysfunctional}} audit behaviour in the Malaysian context; to date, {{no previous}} study has examined this issue. Within this context, the thesis sets outto accomplish two main goals: (1) to investigate the factors contributing to dysfunctional audit behaviour, and (2) to examine whether audit firm, audit team and individual factors affect dysfunctional audit behaviour. This study was carried out {{to coincide with the}} Practice Review currently undertaken by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (M. I. A.), while the current incidence of auditing and accounting scandals in Malaysia provide another factor that prompted this study. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase, i. e. the pilot study, explored the incidence of dysfunctional audit behaviour; the second phase, i. e. the main survey, investigated and examined the factors contributing to dysfunctional audit behaviour. This study extends earlier studies on dysfunctional audit behaviour by examining three different factors, namely audit firm, audit team and individual factors. Dysfunctional audit behaviours investigated are: acceptance of weak client explanations; superficial review of documents; reduction of standards of work below levels considered reasonable; failure to research an accounting principle, and premature sign off. Results of the pilot study and main survey demonstrate the existence of dysfunctional audit behaviour in Malaysian practices. Unlike earlier studies of dysfunctional audit behaviour, this study involves the use of higher ranking <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> in its sample. The study shows that Audit Managers are resorting to some dysfunctional audit behaviour, and that, given their managerial and supervisory roles, the implications of their behaviour could be serious. Respective professional bodies such as the M. I. A. should react to these incidences, since this behaviour could affect audit quality in the long run. Stronger regulations and a greater emphasis on the ethical aspects of such behaviour are suggested. The results suggest that the M. I. A. might seek to have the law, especially the Accountants Act 1967, amended, so that it can investigate its members for suspected dysfunctional behaviour or wrongdoings, instead of waiting for complaints and referrals. In addition, since the incidence of dysfunctional behaviour relates to individual attitudes to formal controls, it is suggested that the management of audit firms should communicate matters relating to audit quality to their personnel at all levels. Implementation of programs to educate personnel at all levels can help the profession and firm to address the phenomenon of dysfunctional audit behaviour, while the introduction of mandatory minimum hours of Continuing Professional Education (CPE) could support this discussion. While such CPE programs can help prevent the occurrence of dysfunctional behaviours, the mechanism that will help most is adherence to audit field work standards together with appropriate supervision...|$|E
40|$|This article {{focus on}} how two supervising {{authorities}} on the transport sector, The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Railway Audit Authority (RAA), have obtained different audit roles. This despite being supervised by the same ministry and having a similar mandate. Both agencies are young in their present form. I study how interaction with the organizational environment and developing internal culture makes a difference in organizational identity and audit performance. To describe audit-roles I use the indicators role consciousness, audit performance, task priority and reporting system. As theoretical tools to analyze the findings an instrumental, an institutional and an environmental perspective is used. Main findings are also compared and categorized through recognized categories for audit-roles and control mechanisms. Within role indicators the variations between the organizations studied exceeds that which {{can be explained by}} looking at the two bodies mainly as tools used against a given goal. Both internal characteristics and the task environment affect the organizational identity and audit-role. The CAA performs more physical control than the RAA. The rules and regulations in the civil aviation sector are stricter, more numerous and more specific. In the railway sector the RAA has more a supervisory role and <b>audit</b> <b>personnel</b> have more leeway when interpreting regulations. While the CAA can be categorized as a magistrate, in the RAA I recognized more the role of a “misunderstood” consultant. In the railway sector there is a history of major communication problems between the RAA and the railway co-operatives. In many cases the co-operatives have actively ignored the RAA and their recommendations regarding security inspections. When 19 people were killed in the Åsta accident, it forced the co-operatives to adopt a more humble attitude. The following investigation blamed the co-operatives for lack of security systems. The RAA gained a much stronger position as a supervising authority on the sector after this accident. In the civil aviation sector the CAA maintains respect and a good relationship with its audit objectives. This {{can be traced back to}} common competence and corporative participation in rule making. In general I find that the responsibility structure on the civil aviation sector is clearer and less confusing than the corresponding structure in the railway sector. However the CAA has had longstanding internal problems between audit departments, between new and old personnel and between leadership and employees. The findings show most similarities between the audits connected to task priority and reporting. This can be traced back to the common reporting institution, which is the Ministry of transport and communications. An interesting finding is that for both agencies the reporting of goal achievements to the ministry is unlikely to have any significant consequence attached to it.
