40|$|This Article {{discusses}} {{a troubling}} {{cause of the}} decline in civil trials — the growing ubiquity of predispute binding arbitration clauses — and discusses tension between roles and responsibilities classically associated with zealous advocacy and the pressing need for new roles and responsibilities associated with ethical dispute system design. Over the past decade, two interacting patterns have come to encourage transactional attorneys to engage in zealous advocacy when crafting predispute binding arbitration clauses in <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts.</b> First, recent U. S. Supreme Court jurisprudence broadly defers and delegates authority to those who create such clauses in <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts</b> with little oversight. Second, members of the public rarely read or understand these clauses buried in the boilerplate. Predispute binding arbitration clauses displace the legal backdrop of fair, legitimate, and just public legal institutions with the dispute-system procedure most preferred by those who draft and design these <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts.</b> Therefore, norms of zealous advocacy may collide with a wider and more virtuous ethic that considers third parties and the public’s desire for a fair, legitimate, and just civil justice system. Before turning to the dialectic between these two ethical principles, we report a psychological experiment conducted with the American public. The study randomly assigned members of the public into conditions that varied how much they learned about the procedure (e. g., a legal definition, an example clause, a New York Times article) and asked them to rate the fairness and justice of binding arbitration. The experiment reveals that the more the public learns about pre-dispute binding arbitration, the more they believe this dispute-resolution procedure is unjust and illegitimate. Yet the vast majority of participants mistakenly believed that they had never entered into a binding-arbitration clause. This empirical legal study illustrates the psychological and felt injustice that many poor and middle-income members of the public experience when learning from legal professionals for the first time both that the legal wrongs they have suffered will likely not be remedied because of barriers imposed by binding arbitration and that the will likely not be able to secure legal representation as a result. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the pressing need for a wider ethic that applies to the transactional attorneys who design binding-arbitration clauses within <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts.</b> We also draw lessons from behavioral legal ethics and social psychology. These lessons reveal that this wider ethic may be endangered by the situational influences that currently operate within law firms (and in-house) due to these two intersecting patterns. We discuss ways of altering the regulatory environment to encourage the wider ethic to flourish in this time of vanishing trials...|$|R

The District Court relied on the California Supreme Court's holding in Discover Bank v.

I do so because, {{although most of the}} court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion follows well-established doctrine, a crucial portion of decision quickly glosses over important unanswered questions about federal arbitration law and the enforceability of pre-dispute arbitration agreements that contemplate the appointment of an evidently partial arbitrator. This makes {{the implications of}} the Second Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision unclear, and it exposes how the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s basic account of federal arbitration law has paid insufficient attention to the frequent and overbearing imposition of arbitration on relatively unsophisticated parties through <b>contracts</b> of <b>adhesion.</b> Indeed, I shall argue that National Football League Management Council (to which I will give the shorthand 2 ̆ 2 NFLMC 2 ̆ 2) must be understood and interpreted in a limited and careful way to avoid damaging the interests of ordinary consumers and employees in a serious and unfair way.

I support this conclusion by showing that the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for conflating <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts</b> with ordinary contracts does not support the consistent enforcement of all agreements that contemplate evidently partial arbitrators. Instead, despite outward appearances to the contrary, federal arbitration law accepts the appointment of evidently partial arbitrators only when the parties genuinely understand and agree to that arrangement.

40|$|Resumé - Bank Contracts Bank Contracts are an {{integral}} part of our everyday lives. Citizen and bussines entities used bank contracts very often. Despite this fact we can't find legal definition in the Czech law. Banking contracts understand contracts that are signed by banks in their business activities and obligations under these contracts arise. While the banking contracts have been widely used, in Czech law there is not too much literature and judgements abou this issue. Lack of legislation, however, can often lead to real life problems in implementing the obligations under those contracts. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse current legislation of bank contracts contained in Commercial Code (Act No. 513 / 1991). The thesis is composed of three main parts. First part is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis. First part is consisting of four chapters. In first chapter I am trying to explain, what bank contracts are.

40|$|Until recently, it was {{understood}} that mandatory arbitration was “do-it-yourself tort reform”: corporate defendants could reduce their liability in consumer and employment disputes through an <b>adhesion</b> <b>contract</b> clause requiring predispute arbitration. But now {{that there is a}} significant possibility that Congress will amend the Federal Arbitration Act to make predispute arbitration clauses unenforceable, critics have been stymied by the reemergence of an argument that mandatory arbitration is “fairer” than litigation. Mandatory arbitration supporters argue that (1) critics have failed to make an empirical case against mandatory arbitration, because existing studies seem to show that plaintiffs do at least as well in arbitration as in court;and (2) mandatory arbitration is a more egalitarian forum than litigation because it is more accessible to smaller claims and claimants. This argument for mandatory arbitration 2 ̆ 7 s “fairness” has effectively tabled the discussion of whether tort reform through mandatory arbitration is justified, and whether an <b>adhesion</b> <b>contract,</b> rather than legislation, should be the vehicle for creating a “fair” dispute resolution system. This Article argues there is no “fairness” justification for imposing a dispute resolution system through adhesion contracts. The economic incentives of the mandatory arbitration system only work by reducing the prospects of plaintiffs with high-cost/high-stakes cases. And while shifting the empirical “burden of proof” onto critics is clever rhetorical strategy, in fact it is the egalitarian argument for mandatory arbitration that is empirically unfounded as well as illogical.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is to test the ability of Jordanian law to protect {{consumers}} against unfair contract terms. In doing this, a comparison is made between the Jordanian Civil Code (hereafter the JCC) and the English Regulations on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts 1999 (hereafter the Regulations). The writer believes that examining {{the effectiveness of a}} law enacted to challenge unfair terms in consumer contracts entails that three main areas should be treated: the scope of protection provided by that law, the test of fairness it generates and the enforcement mechanism it uses. The wider and clearer the scope is, and the clearer the test is, the more effective protection can be expected in favour of consumers. Also, given the position of the consumer as a weak party in the contract, the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism is linked with the deployment of public enforcement besides individual enforcement. By depending on the notion of <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts</b> to protect consumers, Jordanian law has, to a large extent, failed to provide consumers with an acceptable level of protection. The Thesis shows that the scope of the notion of <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts</b> is extremely narrow, falling short of covering all consumer contracts; or, at least, is not clear enough to establish certainty encouraging consumers to litigate. The test of fairness is also a source of uncertainty, since its main features are not set out clearly. Moreover, the enforcement of such protection is not effective since it has been left in the hands of individuals. This is far from being the case under English law, despite the existence of various defects and points of uncertainty throughout the Regulations. The Regulations were enacted to deal specifically with unfair terms in consumer contracts. Generally speaking, they appear to be, well established to undertake this task: the scope of protection is reasonably evident and wide; the test of fairness is, generally, clear; and the model of enforcement is, to a large degree, successful. Therefore, the English Regulations could represent a suitable example to be followed by any new Jordanian legislation aiming at protecting consumers against unfair terms, provided that the defects appearing in the Regulations are avoided and that any special characteristics of Jordanian consumers and the Jordanian legal system are taken into consideration.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{aim of this}} doctoral thesis is to appraise the protection model critically against unfair contract terms in Kuwait and propose solutions for its reform. The thesis examines the Kuwaiti Civil Code (KCC) provisions that regulate unfair terms {{in the context of}} the standard form of <b>contracts</b> (i. e., <b>adhesion)</b> and relevant case law. It primarily seeks to address two main issues: (i) why the Kuwaiti control model for the protection against unfair terms has failed and (ii) how it can be reformed. It argues that the existing control model has failed considerably in providing adhering parties with an adequate level of protection for two reasons. First, the regulation of unfair terms in the context of <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts</b> is fraught with ambiguities and legal lacunae that render it flawed and ineffective. Second, the courts’ restrictive interpretation of what constitutes an adhesion has limited the protection to only a few types of contracts. The thesis explores how the protection model can be overhauled and, where relevant, uses European Union Council Directive 93 / 13 /EEC on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts as a normative framework to offer proposals for law reform. To achieve this end, the thesis is divided into an introduction, five chapters, and a conclusion. It starts with a brief introduction, focusing mainly on the statement of the problem, motivation for the research, research objectives and methodology. Chapter one seeks to explore whether, in the light of the statutory deficiency, the general principles of contract law can be employed to counter unfair terms. The aim is to confirm the main hypothesis of the thesis and explain why legislative intervention is needed. Chapter two deals with the scope of protection and discusses the notion of <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts,</b> their regulation in the KCC and how they have been interpreted by the courts. Chapter three explores the connotations of the concept of unfair terms and seeks to determine whether the ambiguous concept of contractual unfairness can be explained with reference to the theory of abuse of rights. Chapter four assesses the court’s role in disputes involving unfair terms. Chapter five highlights the need to introduce a parallel enforcement mechanism and suggests the establishment of a public body entrusted with the task of eliminating unfair terms from the market. The final segment of the study presents concluding remarks and suggests recommendations for law reform...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{has led to}} the {{development}} of new payment devices and processing systems, and a complicated body of public and private payments law has been established in response. In this environment, consumers have little control over how their payment instruments will be processed. They are subject to onerous <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts.</b> It is difficult for consumers to understand the legal consequences of using one payment device over another. In light of these developments, many are questioning how much responsibility the law should impose on consumers when errors occur and how much protection they deserve. Some experts favor legal rules that take maximum advantage of the efficiencies technology can achieve and retention of the present legal rules which vary from one payment device and processing system to another. The better approach, however, is to recognize that consumers have common objectives, regardless of the type of payment device they use or how it is processed. These objectives can be achieved through uniform laws that apply to all types of payment instruments and systems. Those laws should guarantee the right to an error resolution procedure, adjudication of disputes before a judicial forum, and a sixty day deadline for reporting erroneous payments...|$|R
40|$|<b>Contracts</b> of <b>adhesion</b> are {{commonly}} criticized because of perceptions that such contracts lack {{the same quality}} of mutual assent that is present in fully-dickered agreements. This Article challenges such assent-based critiques {{in the context of}} Internet-based contracting. This challenge is based upon the proposition that even if producers provided extraordinary opportunities for consumer assent to contract terms, such assent would not meaningfully change the terms of producer contracts. Unlike mail or phone order transactional systems, internet-based contracting provides for the possibilities of rapid and low-cost changes to price menus for various contract options and the ability to price accurately contract terms that the parties may wish to include in their agreements. Thus, Internet-based contracting permits producers to offer consumers a la carte contract choices and to determine how to price those choices. Given sufficient information, producers could theoretically offer consumers meaningful choices over every term in a contract, provided that the consumer {{would be willing to pay}} for those choices. The resulting “selection assent” by the consumers would be for all intents and purposes largely indistinguishable from the type of assent rendered in a fully-dickered contract. But producers still control the prices at which they offer goods and services. Even though the hypothetical contract that would result from finely-grained selection assent could be highly-customized, so long as the producer retains power to set the prices of various contract terms consumers may be driven to the contract terms preferred by the producer. Thus, producers could charge prices that no rational consumer would pay if a particular consumer wanted to contract away from terms such as mandatory arbitration or a class action waiver. Even if some nonrational consumers chose to purchase customized terms, the lost network benefits would limit the producer’s exposure to liability from a few oddballs who bargained for the ability to litigate or to maintain a class action. Additionally, actual experience with clickwrap contracts shows that consumers almost never read the contracts and might be willing to accept without serious inspection an option simply to take the lowest cost terms offered by the producer even if they were given the power to select different terms for increased prices. Consequently, investments in improving the quality of consumer assent—even in the potentially superior context of selection assent to all possible terms of the contract—may not improve the quality of the resulting contract. These conclusions suggest that assent-based critiques of <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts</b> lack persuasive force in the Internet-based contracting context, and that more powerful critiques should focus on the pricing of <b>adhesion</b> <b>contracts</b> and adhesive contract terms...|$|R
