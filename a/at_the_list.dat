25|$|On April 6, 2009, Halladay {{made his}} team-record seventh {{straight}} Opening Day start for Toronto, defeating the Detroit Tigers. Halladay then also won his next two starts, {{on the road}} against the Cleveland Indians and the Minnesota Twins. Halladay lost his next game to the Rangers giving up 5 earned runs over 8 innings only {{to go on and}} win his next 6 games to bring his record up to 8–1 with a 2.75 ERA. With season-ending injuries to planned 2009 Jays' starters Dustin McGowan and Shawn Marcum, and with #2 starter Jesse Litsch on the disabled list early in the season, Halladay led a staff of young, mostly inexperienced starters. Halladay was named the AL Player of the Week for the period ending May 17. Doc was 2–0 with a 1.13 ERA over 16.0 innings in his two starts the week prior. In a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on June 2, Halladay struck out 14 batters and threw 133 pitches, both career highs. On June 12, he left the game early because of a strained hip adductor muscle, commonly referred to as a pulled groin, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 17. On July 5, he was selected to represent Toronto at the All-Star Game. On July 14, he started the All-Star Game for the American League, pitching 2 innings and giving up 3 runs, of which 1 was unearned. That year, he was named #7 on the Sporting Newss list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.

500|$|Another {{principal}} {{topic of}} discussion among critics has been True Detective auteurist sensibility. Auteurism is a critical framework that assesses films or other works of art as reflections of the personal vision of individual authors, typically a director or writer. At the helm {{of each of the}} season's episodes are Pizzolatto and Fukunaga—its sole writer and director—a partnership that provides the show a unique place in a traditionally collaborative medium where broad sets of writers and directors work in tandem. Colin Robertson <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>List</b> saw Twin Peaks as the most notable artistic antecedent to True Detective first season because both shows challenge crime drama cliches and [...] "use the genre conventions of a whodunnit-style mystery as a sublimely subversive diving board, and leap off from there to tell a broader story." ...|$|E

[...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin also wrote about the [...] "laundry list of intoxicants" [...] referenced in the song, noting that it [...] "makes 'Devil Pray' sound like a mid-80s PSA." [...] Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media went on to criticize the list for being [...] "a strange, tender, comical thing, [...] but ultimately, it's a boring stadium-throb lite-EDM song about seeking sobriety and/or big-G, God.

500|$|She was {{captured}} on 17 March 1918 when Nikolaev {{was occupied by}} the Germans and Austrians, but they did nothing with her incomplete hull. On 25 January 1919 she was listed by the Directorate of Ukraine as planned to be completed and included into the navy list by 1920. On 27 January 1919 she was mentioned at Directorate Navy Ministry order <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> for renaming from 1920 [...] – into Soborna Ukraina (: Union of Ukraine). However none of the short-lived Directorate orders were actually implemented. She remained at Nikolayev throughout the Russian Civil War, of no use to either side. The victorious Soviets finally inspected her in 1923 {{to see if she}} was worth completing. Her dilapidated state and obsolescent design caused them to conclude that it was not worth doing and she should be sold for scrap. Efforts were made to sell the hull abroad to raise hard currency, but when these came to nought she was towed to Sevastopol on 28 June 1927 to begin dismantling.|$|E
500|$|Sally visits Larry at a DVD {{shop and}} is {{told that he}} has been documenting an [...] "Easter egg" [...] in {{seventeen}} apparently unrelated DVDs. The egg contains video clips of a man calling himself The Doctor, having half of a conversation with the viewer. Larry gives Sally a list of the DVDs and she leaves for the police station. There she meets DI Billy Shipton, who explains that there have been several disappearances at Wester Drumlins and shows her an impound lot containing a locked fake police box. Sally leaves but remembers the Yale key and returns to find that Billy and the phone box have disappeared. She immediately receives a call from a much older Billy, who is on his death bed at the hospital. She visits him and he explains that after she left the lot, he discovered the Angels trying to retrieve the police box. He then suddenly found himself in 1969, where he met the Doctor and was asked to relay a message to Sally decades later. Billy subsequently married and started a video production house that was responsible for putting the Easter egg on the DVDs. Before Billy dies he tells Sally the Doctor's message, which instructs her to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> Sally realises that the list is her own DVD collection and that the Easter egg is meant for her.|$|E

500|$|The Tribal Hidage is, {{according}} to D. P. Kirby's description, [...] "a list of total assessments {{in terms of}} hides {{for a number of}} territories south of the Humber, which has been variously dated from the mid-7th to {{the second half of the}} 8th century". Most of the kingdoms of the Heptarchy are included. Mercia, which is assigned 30,000 hides, is at the top <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>list,</b> followed by a number of small tribes to the west and north of Mercia, all of which have no more than 7000 hides listed. Other named tribes have even smaller hidages, of between 300 and 1200 hides: of these the Herefinna, Noxgaga, [...] Hendrica and Unecungaga cannot be identified, whilst the others have been tentatively located around the south of England and in the border region between Mercia and East Anglia. Ohtgaga can be heard as Jutegaga and understood as the area settled by Jutes in and near the Meon Valley of Hampshire. The term'-gaga' is a late copyist mistranscription of the Old English '-wara' (people/ men of) the letter forms of 'w' wynn and the long-tailed 'r' being read as 'g'. A number of territories, such as the Hicca, have only been located by means of place-names evidence. The list concludes with several other kingdoms from the Heptarchy: the East Angles (who are assessed at 30,000 hides), the East Saxons (7,000 hides), Kent (15,000 hides), the South Saxons (7,000 hides) and Wessex, which is assessed at 100,000 hides.|$|E
2500|$|Viewed from an anthropological perspective, hacking is a {{cultural}} tradition affirming group solidarity, but some hacks can also be viewed as individualistic creative or artistic expression. [...] For example the [...] "Massachusetts Toolpike" [...] hack [...] was a clear instance of installation art [...] or environmental art. [...] Hacks which involve staged public actions [...] (e.g. a zombie march or the Time Traveler Convention of 2005) are clearly a form of performance art, often combined with body art and cosplay. [...] Still other hacks have a strong conceptual art flavor, often satirizing other purported works of conceptual art. [...] Sometimes the boundaries have been deliberately blurred, for example when a satirical work of [...] "conceptual art" [...] (No Knife: a study in mixed media earth tones, number three) was surreptitiously added to a [...] "serious" [...] art gallery show <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>List</b> Visual Arts Center.|$|E
2500|$|Football {{is by far}} {{the most}} popular sport in Argentina. It was brought by the British railway {{businessmen}} and workers, and it was later embraced with passion by the other collectivities. The first official football match ever played in Argentina took place on 20 June 1867, when the [...] "White Caps" [...] beat the [...] "Red Caps" [...] by 4–0. A look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of players -eight by team- shows a collection of British names/surnames. [...] "White Caps": Thomas Hogg, James Hogg, Thomas Smith, William Forrester, James W. Bond, E. Smith, Norman Smith and James Ramsbotham. [...] "Red Caps": Walter Heald, Herbert Barge, Thomas Best, Urban Smith, John Wilmott, R. Ramsay, J. Simpson and William Boschetti. The development of this sport in Argentina was greatly boosted by Scottish teacher Alexander Watson Hutton. He arrived in Argentina in 1882 and founded the Buenos Aires English High School in 1884, hiring his countryman William Walters as coach of the school's football team. On 21 February 1893 Watson founded the Argentine Association Football League, the historical antecedent of the Asociación de Fútbol Argentino. Watson's son Arnold continued the tradition playing during the amateur age of Argentine football.|$|E

2500|$|By mid-November 1940, {{when the}} Germans adopted a changed plan, more than [...] of high {{explosive}} and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries {{had fallen on}} London. Outside the capital, there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft, as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool, but no major raids. The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding, and much damage {{had been done to}} the railway system outside. In September, there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain, and at one period, between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs. But the great bulk of the traffic went on; and Londoners—though they glanced apprehensively each morning <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station, or made strange detours round back streets in the buses—still got to work. For all the destruction of life and property, the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale. More than 13,000 civilians had been killed, and almost 20,000 injured, in September and October alone, but the death toll was much less than expected. In late 1940, Churchill credited the shelters.|$|E
