5|$|Airborne radar for {{detecting}} ships at sea {{came to be}} known as Air-to-Surface-Vessel (ASV) radar. Its successes led to continued demands for <b>additional</b> <b>tests.</b> Growing interest and increased efforts in ASV contributed to delays in airborne intercept sets; the team spent a considerable time in 1937 and 1938 working on the ASV problem.|$|E
5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Kritschgau and Skinner put Mulder under <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> {{to verify}} his {{abnormal}} brain activity. They again inject Mulder with phenytoin, {{but this time}} they are caught by Fowley and Mulder goes into a seizure. Meanwhile Dr. Barnes, in a bizarre type of experiment, kills his driver, but the driver soon reanimates and kills him instead. Scully flies back to the U.S. and visits Mulder at the hospital. On the African coast, Ngebe arrives with the police, finding Dr. Barnes dead and the spaceship gone.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, the New York Daily News {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but the New York Daily News leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds â€“ additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. <b>Additional</b> <b>tests</b> may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{results were}} favorable, and a {{full-scale}} mockup was formally reviewed in March 1949. The prototype {{was completed by}} August 1949, but an incident involving the rival swept-wing Tupolev Tu-82 that broke an engine mount during a low-altitude flight led to delays as <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> were demanded to determine {{the strength of the}} wings before the first flight was made. By the following year, the Il-30 program had lost momentum as the Ilyushin OKB was ordered to concentrate its resources on facilitating the service introduction of the Il-28. It was formally terminated by government order on 20 August 1950, and the prototype was eventually scrapped {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s. Aviation historian Bill Gunston quotes a maiden flight date of 9 September 1949, but Vaclav Nemecek says 1951.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{review of}} the {{information}} provided by the supplier may yield evidence of potential photo-enhanced toxicity, especially to aquatic organisms. In this case <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> designed to answer concerns about the product may be required. The Project Leader for Fire Chemicals, will send the supplier a letter notifying them of the need for <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> the reasons for that testing, and an estimate of the cost and time to perform the tests. The supplier will be asked to either approve the <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> at their expense, or the product evaluation will be cancelled. Once supplier approval for <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> has been received, a sample of the product that was submitted to the Forest Service for qualification testing is then sent to an approved testing lab. Results are sent back to the Forest Service. The Project Leader for Fire Chemicals compiles the results and prepares a letter to the supplier showing the performance of the submitted product. A copy of the lab report is also provided to the supplier. Method: 1. All testing shall be performed in accordance with STP- 1. 4, Fish Toxicity...|$|R

25|$|After the Caproni company {{completed}} initial {{testing of}} the Stipa-Caproni, the Regia Aeronautica took control of it and conducted a brief series of <b>additional</b> <b>tests,</b> but did not develop it further because the Stipa-Caproni offered no performance improvement over aircraft of conventional design.|$|E
25|$|Unresponsive CAP {{may be due}} to a complication, a previously-unknown health problem, {{inappropriate}} antibiotics for the causative organism, a previously-unsuspected microorganism (such as tuberculosis) or {{a condition}} mimicking CAP (such as granuloma with polyangiitis). <b>Additional</b> <b>tests</b> include X-ray computed tomography, bronchoscopy or lung biopsy.|$|E

40|$|Some authors {{recommend}} {{the use of}} an <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> for detecting increases in the spread, when using a control chart for individual observations. We examine this recommendation both in a practical situation and theoretically. Both studies show that the <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> gives somewhat more power for detecting a 25 % increase of the process variation. For nearly all other deviations from the in-control state the test is more likely to cause confusion. From a practical viewpoint we therefore advise against its use. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>tests</b> {{may include}} nuclear {{medicine}} MAG3 scan to confirm blood flow and establish the differential function {{between the two}} kidneys.

25|$|These H5N1 infections may {{be quite}} common; {{in a survey of}} 10 {{apparently}} healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java, where avian flu had broken out, five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus.

5000|$|For example, {{investing}} <b>additional</b> time <b>testing</b> {{a software}} product often {{reduces the risk}} due to the marketplace rejecting a shoddy product. However, <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> time might increase the risk due to a competitor's early market entry. From a spiral model perspective, testing should be performed until the total risk is minimized, and no further.|$|R
