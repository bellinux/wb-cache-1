5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|E

25|$|Even {{as a young}} boy, Ryelandt had a mind of his own. Much as he revered his “best piano teacher,” Franz Devos (of the Ghent Conservatory) {{who gave}} him private lessons, he wrote that Devos “did not pay enough {{attention}} to technique, which left me unsatisfied.” While he learned <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> Tinel, whose technical mastery he greatly admired, he also let himself be influenced by Wagner, whom Tinel detested, and by French composers such as Franck, Fauré and Debussy, whereas Tinel was primarily German-oriented. But Ryelandt never belonged to any school or fashion; in fact, he despised fashion.|$|E
25|$|The Oto-Manguean {{languages}} {{have changed}} quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> the very spartan phoneme inventory of Proto-Oto-Manguean.

The voiced series of the Oto-Pamean languages have both fricative and stop allophones. Otomian also have full series of front, central and back vowels. Some analyses of Mixtecan include a series of voiced prenasalised stops and affricates; these can also be analysed as consonant sequences {{but it would be}} the only consonant clusters known in the languages.|$|E

The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching {{the bottom of the}} rib cage, much like a bolero jacket.

25|$|Distanced from Portugal {{after the}} seventeenth century Goans, like the people of Macão and Timor, Goans had been left much to their own affairs with {{a higher degree of}} independence, {{although}} still a part of Portugal. Goans moved considerably {{to other parts of the}} Portuguese Empire, and metropolitan Portugal and it is possible to find Goans with roots in America, Africa, Europe as well as Asia. After 450 years of being a part of Portugal, during the first post-Liberation years, Goans found it difficult to embrace their new status as part of India and many emigrated to other nations (predominately western), a trend that often continues to date. However, Goan-Catholics in India today are proud of their Portuguese-Indian Catholic culture, their Konkani language and their role in modern multi-religious India. However many aspects of their social and religious life are deeply enshrined in their exquisite western heritage. For instance they celebrate Carnival (western practice) before lent and their religious scripture (Catholic church) is only written and conducted in the Latin script. Even their language takes <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> Portuguese in terms of syntax or loan words.|$|E
