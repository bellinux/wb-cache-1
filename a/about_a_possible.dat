5|$|The film {{depicts the}} {{destruction}} of several cultural and historical icons around the world. Emmerich said that the Kaaba was considered for selection, but Kloser was concerned <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> fatwā against him.|$|E
5|$|A short {{programme}} {{commissioned by}} the BBC about the alleged manifestations, scheduled to be broadcast in September 1956, was cancelled owing to concerns <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> legal action by Marianne Foyster, widow of the last rector {{to live in the}} house.|$|E
5|$|Concerned <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> schism in {{the party}} {{that could lead to}} a heated primary, split electorate, and {{weakened}} stance, high-ranking members of the party backed Gillibrand and requested major opponents not to run. In the end, Gillibrand faced Gail Goode, a lawyer from New York City, and won the primary with 76% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|During the 2014 {{election}} cycle, Warren {{was a top}} Democratic fundraiser. Following the election, Warren {{was appointed}} to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position that was created just for her. The appointment further added to speculation <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> presidential run by Warren in 2016.|$|E
5|$|While {{recording}} {{an audio}} commentary for that film in 1997, Kneale speculated <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> Quatermass prequel set in 1930s Germany. According to The Independent, Kneale conceived a storyline involving the young Quatermass {{becoming involved in}} German rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and helping a young Jewish woman to escape the country during the 1936 Berlin Olympics.|$|E
5|$|By {{signing the}} Treaty of Utrecht, King Louis XIV of France {{recognised}} the Hanoverian succession in Britain. Nevertheless, gossip that Anne and her ministers favoured {{the succession of}} her half-brother rather than the Hanoverians continued, despite Anne's denials in public and in private. The rumours were fed by her consistent refusals to permit any of the Hanoverians to visit or move to England, and by the intrigues of Harley and the Tory Secretary of State Lord Bolingbroke, who were in separate and secret discussions with her half-brother <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> Stuart restoration until early 1714.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, aged 16, {{he won the}} Australian amateur junior welterweight title on the Gold Coast and was talked <b>about</b> as <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> {{prospect}} for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, but {{from that point on}} he lost interest in the sport, eventually quitting it after his 25th amateur fight.|$|R
2500|$|For Sigmund Freud {{the famous}} half-smile was a {{recovered}} memory of Leonardo's mother. In 1994 Leonardo's biographer Serge Bramly wrote, [...] "there are <b>about</b> <b>a</b> dozen <b>possible</b> identifications of the sitter, all {{more or less}} defensible ... Some people have suggested {{that there was no}} model at all, that Leonardo was painting an ideal woman." ...|$|R
5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal {{purpose of the}} infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not believe any attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing {{to be drawn into}} battles.|$|E
5|$|Kulikovsky was {{appointed}} as {{captain in the}} Blue Cuirassiers and posted to the provinces. By 1906, he and Olga were corresponding regularly, when Olga's husband Duke Peter appointed Kulikovsky as his aide-de-camp. With Peter's permission, Kulikovsky moved into the 200-room residence in Sergievskaya Street, Saint Petersburg, that Peter shared with Olga. According to a fellow officer, gossip <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> romance between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess, based on little more than their holding hands in public, spread through high society.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Favre was in contact with the Packers <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> return to the team. On July 11, 2008, Favre {{sent a letter to the}} Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team. Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.|$|E

50|$|He had an {{impressive}} off {{season with the}} club in 2002, and was even talked <b>about</b> as <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> NRL Rookie of the Year award winner for the 2002 season. However he suffered a severe knee injury and required a knee ACL reconstruction. This was later compounded when he developed a Golden staph infection which injury ruined his next two seasons and haunted him {{for the rest of}} his career.|$|R
5|$|Sailing {{upon the}} Aquitania via Fremantle and Cape Town, the {{battalion}} arrived at Gourock, Scotland, after six weeks at sea. Initially {{they had been}} destined to join {{the rest of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East, but due to concerns <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> invasion of the United Kingdom by the German Wehrmacht, {{the decision was made to}} divert the division's second echelon, a brigade-sized force that included the 28th (Māori) Battalion, to Britain to help bolster the island's defences.|$|E
5|$|The cafe {{originated}} {{when friends}} from the Rainbow Family began {{to communicate with each}} other <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Rainbow Family are best known for the Rainbow Gathering, a large, primitive type camping event in which up to 20,000 people attend. Those who attend these gatherings have become skilled at making and serving food for extremely large groups of people for long periods of time and in very basic situations.|$|E
5|$|After Marcello Lippi's reappointment as the {{national}} team's manager following Euro 2008, Totti {{announced that he would}} play in the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa if he were to receive a call-up; however, there was no official statement release from Totti or Lippi <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> comeback. For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon said {{one of the reasons for}} Italy's early exit was due to the lack of creative players like Totti in the team.|$|E
30|$|With {{the example}} of the {{connectable}} crochet hook multimeter probe, we introduced a tool relating to textile making and electronic functionality. In designing tools specific to textile electronic crafts, we want to spark <b>a</b> discussion <b>about</b> <b>a</b> different <b>possible</b> realm of the coming into being of electronic components and devices. In deliberately referencing a century-old craft, and with it its skilled workers, we want to question existing cultures of technology production.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{strengths}} of the scenario process is its influence on the way of thinking of its participants. A mindset, in which the focus is placed on one possible future, is altered towards the balanced thinking <b>about</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>possible</b> alternative futures.|$|R
5000|$|The coroner {{rejected}} suicide, {{interest in}} bondage or cross-dressing, or [...] "auto-erotic activity" [...] {{being involved in}} Williams's death. She said his visits to bondage websites only occurred intermittently and were not of a frequency to indicate an active interest. The coroner condemned leaks <b>about</b> cross-dressing as <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> attempt at media manipulation.|$|R
5|$|Altman {{was then}} {{instructed}} to contact Newark Liberty International Airport, a directive he agreed to. However, {{he did not}} contact the tower at Newark. It later transpired that, in acknowledging the instruction to contact Newark, Altman had read back the wrong frequency (127.8MHz instead of 127.85), an error that the controller did not correct. Soon after, a controller at Newark who was concerned about aircraft in the Piper's path contacted the Teterboro controller and asked the him to attempt to re-establish contact. All attempts to contact Altman and change his aircraft's heading were unsuccessful. After the failure to contact Altman, a radar alert <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> collision occurred in both the Newark and Teterboro towers. However, the two controllers did not remember seeing or hearing this alert.|$|E
5|$|Bueno's {{schedule}} at {{the time}} included twenty-five to thirty shows weekly. Due to his demanding tours, Bueno began consuming beer to excess, which began to interfere with his performing. His stress level was further increased from receiving multiple death threats. Following a concert at the nightclub Escándalo in La Plata, Bueno was returning {{to the city of}} Buenos Aires on the evening of June 24, 2000. After his path was blocked by another driver who had passed him on the turnpike, Bueno tried to chase the vehicle to move in front of it again. In the process, he lost control of his SUV and crashed against a barrier. He was ejected from the SUV and he died instantly. His death caused an immediate sensation in the Argentine media, with speculation <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> murder conspiracy. After a short trial, the driver of the other vehicle was found not guilty; the judge considered Bueno to have been responsible for driving imprudently.|$|E
5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E
5000|$|He {{then moved}} on to Atlanta from 1980 through 1986. He had one at-bat with the Yankees in 1988 and struck out. (According to Lou Piniella, this at-bat earned him about $20,000, since he had to be paid the minimum player salary for the season after he was {{activated}} for that at-bat.) He retired with a career [...]279 batting average and 185 home runs. After his playing days ended, Chambliss became a hitting instructor for several teams and was talked <b>about</b> as <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> managerial candidate.|$|R
6000|$|... 1 It {{is rather}} odd that, {{in the course}} of casting <b>about</b> for <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> murderer of Gandia, public opinion should never have {{fastened}} upon Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. He had lately been stripped of the Patrimony of St. Peter that the governorship of this might be bestowed upon Gandia; his resentment had been provoked by that action of the Pope's, and the relations between himself and the Borgias were strained in consequence. Possibly there was clear proof that he could have had no connection with the crime.|$|R
50|$|A pedlar enters, Simana Arhippaini from Karelia, {{tells the}} {{children}} riddles and sings a ballad, but cannot answer their serious questions.

5|$|Due to the {{prolonged}} development {{period of the}} film, in 2010, DC Entertainment shifted focus onto developing a television series adaptation. Film director James Mangold pitched a series concept to cable channel HBO, whilst consulting with Gaiman himself on an unofficial basis, but this proved to be unsuccessful. It was reported in September 2010 that Warner Bros. Television was licensing the rights to produce a TV series, and that Supernatural creator Eric Kripke was their preferred candidate to adapt the saga. In March 2011, it was announced via Neil Gaiman's web blog that while he and DC liked Eric Kripke and his approach, it didn't feel quite right. The author hoped to launch the series in another form but plans for a television adaptation are on hold as production moves forward on the film. As the film adaptation of Morpheus' story was being planned, DC and Fox discussed in September <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> TV series based on the Sandman character Lucifer.|$|E
5|$|Embarking on the Mt Vernon in Port Tewfik, the {{battalion}} sailed from Egypt in early February and arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, in mid-March. After this, {{the battalion}} camped at Woodside, in the Adelaide Hills, where {{a period of}} re-conditioning and exercises followed until mid-April when {{the majority of its}} personnel were sent on home leave. At the end of the month, those that remained undertook a five-day train journey to Casino, New South Wales. Limited training was undertaken until mid-May, around which time orders were received for another move, this time to Caboolture, Queensland. By the end of the month, the battalion returned to almost full strength when the final leave draft returned. At the time, the strategic situation in the Pacific was in the balance; the Japanese were advancing south and due to concerns <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> Japanese invasion, the 25th Brigade was tasked with defending the coastal area north of Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{set a new}} fastest lap of {{the race}} on lap 47 to reduce the time deficit to Vettel to 7.9 seconds. Petrov began to {{challenge}} de la Rosa for 12th place on the same lap. Hülkenberg's right rear tyre delaminated on lap 50, causing damage to his car's exhaust system and became the race's final retirement. Kobayashi made his only pit stop of the event on lap 53 and rejoined in ninth position behind Alonso. Button was worried <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> post-race time penalty and pushed hard to record the overall fastest lap of the race, a 1:38.766, on the 54th lap. Alonso challenged Buemi for seventh place on lap 55 {{but was unable to}} pass him. Kobayashi ran closely behind Alonso and passed him around the inside for eighth when Alonso ran wide at turn 17 on the following lap. Buemi was overtaken by Kobayashi at the final corner on the last lap of the race to clinch seventh.|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s {{he worked}} as a tennis coach in Hong Kong for the territory's Sports Institute. He made a {{comeback}} to the tour in 1996, by which time he was eligible to represent Hong Kong due to long term residency and was talked <b>about</b> as <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> Davis Cup selection. His return to tennis consisted of a series of Asian satellite tournaments and he won both the singles and doubles titles at an event in Tianjin. He took part in the qualifying draw for the men's singles at the 1997 Australian Open.|$|R

50|$|Nonetheless, Phillips {{remained}} on the radar of Australian selectors. He was picked as 12th man for the 3rd test, and selected in a Young Australian side to tour Zimbabwe in early 1983 as a wicketkeeper batsman. The highlight of this tour for Phillips was scoring 135 in a one-day game. After this success, commentators started talking <b>about</b> Phillips as <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> Australian wicketkeeper.|$|R
