5|$|Later in 1938, {{when there}} was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor {{practices}} by the studios against directors, Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios, alongside Darryl Zanuck and E. J. Mannix. Sitting <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> were W. S. Van Dyke, Howard Hawks, and Briskin's friend, Frank Capra. In 1939, Briskin was once again involved in potential legal proceedings, being {{one of a number of}} producers who were called to testify before the National Labor Relations Board, regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild (SWG). During the hearings, it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild. After the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia at the beginning of World War II, AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee, which was a sub-committee of the organization's Research Council. Headed by the council's chairman, Darryl F. Zanuck, Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee. The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production. In mid-November 1940 Briskin, along with the committee's chair Major Nathan Levinson, participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild, in order to select writers to go to Monmouth, New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films.|$|E

The scene is probably the great cabin of Graham's latest command, and the sails of ships are visible through the line of windows on {{the left of the}} painting. The furniture and objects are luxurious and the room is richly panelled and decorated. The chaplain holds a ledger and at his feet is a large famille-rose punch bowl, the punch bowl being an invitation to the viewer to join the levity at the table. He is separated from Graham <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> by a salt-cellar, possibly symbolising their social difference. His presence at the captain's table for this informal occasion nevertheless indicates that he is a privileged member of Graham's entourage.|$|E
25|$|A {{shooting}} war {{was triggered}} {{when one of}} the strikers, believed to have been unarmed, had been shot through the throat by a deputized mine guard. In spite of intense pressure from others, Lieutenant Governor David C. Coates helped to persuade Governor Orman not to send the Colorado National Guard. Coates volunteered to mediate, and he was dispatched by the governor {{to be part of a}} commission sent to Telluride to investigate the issues that caused the walkout. Vincent St. John and mine operator Arthur L. Collins finally met <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and the commission was able to effect a settlement between the miners and the company, resulting in more than a year of labor peace in San Miguel County's silver mines.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Lethem {{wrote of}} the {{influence}} The End of the Road had on his novel As She Climbed <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (1997), which also involves a love triangle in an academic setting. [...] In Lethem's novel, the narrator, in a position similar to Joe Morgan's, experiences the dilemma of [...] "losing a woman to a rival who", like Jake Horner, [...] "refuses to provide any fixed identity to hate, compete with, or understand".|$|E
500|$|His {{next book}} was Amnesia Moon (1995). [...] Partially {{inspired}} by Lethem's experiences hitchhiking cross-country, this second novel uses a road narrative {{to explore a}} multi-post-apocalyptic future landscape rife with perception tricks. [...] After publishing many of his early stories in a 1996 collection, The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye, Lethem published his third novel, As She Climbed <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (1997). It starts with a physics researcher {{who falls in love}} with an artificially generated spatial anomaly called [...] "Lack", for whom she spurns her previous partner. [...] Her ex-partner's comic struggle with this rejection, and with the anomaly, constitute the majority of the narrative.|$|E

500|$|Cloth {{has been}} used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century. The {{predecessor}} company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of baize that is dyed green, and is made from 100% worsted wool, which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> [...] The green color of cloth was originally chosen to emulate the look of grass, and has been so colored since the 16th century. However, as in green eyeshades, the color also serves a useful function: Humans have a higher light sensitivity to green than to any other color, so green cloth permits play {{for longer periods of time}} without eye strain.|$|E
500|$|The form of {{linguistic}} expression often does {{not correspond to}} the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, [...] "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not {{a question about the}} length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.|$|E
500|$|The next {{films in}} which Lombard {{appeared}} were Henry Hathaway's Now and Forever (1934), featuring Gary Cooper {{and the new}} child star Shirley Temple, and Lady by Choice (1934), which was a critical and commercial success. The Gay Bride (1934) placed her opposite Chester Morris in a gangster comedy, but this outing was panned by critics. After reuniting with George Raft for another dance picture, Rumba (1935), Lombard was {{given the opportunity to}} repeat the screwball success of Twentieth Century. In [...] Mitchell Leisen's Hands <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (1935), she portrayed a manicurist in search of a rich husband, played by Fred MacMurray. Critics praised the film, and Photoplays reviewer stated that Lombard had reaffirmed her talent for the genre. It is remembered as one of her best films, and the pairing of Lombard and MacMurray proved so successful that they made three more pictures together.|$|E

500|$|... "A Benihana Christmas" [...] was {{directed}} by Harold Ramis and written by Jennifer Celotta. It was produced by Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais, Greg Daniels, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman. The episode was shot in a real Benihana restaurant. According to the show's prop master, different actresses were used because Andy and Michael failed {{to pick up the}} original waitresses, and settled for [...] "less attractive ones". At Paley Fest 2007, Greg Daniels admitted that the joke failed due to poor casting. The waitresses that come to the office were supposed to be unattractive. Daniels stated that the actresses they hired for the role were [...] "too good-looking". During filming, John Krasinski threw a shrimp <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at Rainn Wilson. It bounced off Dwight's glasses and landed in the glass of water he was about to drink. The producers chose not to use the footage because it looked so improbable as to be unbelievable.|$|E
500|$|As the {{prominence}} {{of the issue of}} Rhodesia increased in the late 1970s, attention on Van der Byl increased. Reporters noted his impressively quotable lines at press conferences (such as his explanation for why the Rhodesian government did not usually give the names of guerrillas which it had hanged: [...] "Why should we? Anyway, it's academic because they're normally dead after it"). While negotiating with the Patriotic Front put together by ZANU and ZAPU at the Geneva Conference in November 1976, he described ZANU leader Robert Mugabe as [...] "this bloodthirsty Marxist puppet" [...] and the Patriotic Front proposals as [...] "almost a parody, a music hall caricature of communist invective". [...] Mugabe repeatedly arrived late to the meetings held during the conference, and on one occasion Van der Byl tersely reprimanded the ZANU leader for his tardiness. Mugabe flew into a rage and shouted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at Van der Byl, calling the Rhodesian minister a [...] "foul-mouthed bloody fool!" ...|$|E
500|$|Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as {{a leading}} lady, {{primarily}} in drama films. Her profile increased when she married William Powell in 1931, but the couple divorced after two years. A turning point in Lombard's career came when she starred in Howard Hawks' pioneering screwball comedy Twentieth Century (1934). The actress found her niche in this genre, and continued to appear in films such as Hands <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (1935) (forming a popular partnership with Fred MacMurray), My Man Godfrey (1936), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and Nothing Sacred (1937). At this time, Lombard married [...] "the King of Hollywood", Clark Gable, and the supercouple gained much attention from the media. Keen to win an Oscar, {{at the end of}} the decade, Lombard began to move towards more serious roles. Unsuccessful in this aim, she returned to comedy in Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) and Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (1942)—her final film role.|$|E

500|$|War for Cybertron {{developer}} High Moon Studios {{and publisher}} Activision {{worked closely with}} Hasbro to create the design and story for the game.

[...] "That was that first sketch that we slid <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to Hasbro and said 'What do you guys think?' [...] And that's where it all started" [...] said Tieger. High Moon presented the idea of setting the game on Cybertron during the Transformers' civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons. [...] Aaron Archer, Senior Design Director for Hasbro, stated of the Cybertron-based setting [...] "that's a really cool place [...] and the early days of that civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons was a story that hadn't really been fleshed out in any format." ...|$|E
