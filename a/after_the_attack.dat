30|$|Attacks had a {{long lasting}} impact over the {{performance}} of the system, reducing its activity.

5|$|While Deloraine {{attended}} to the torpedoed ships, {{the other four}} escorts attempted to locate the Japanese submarine. I-174 had not been detected approaching the convoy, and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> the Australian corvettes reversed their courses to conduct a sonar sweep of the area from where she was presumed to have attacked. This was in accordance with tactics that had recently been adopted by the RAN after they proved successful in the Battle of the Atlantic. Warrnambool detected the submarine 23 minutes <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> and she and Kalgoorlie subjected I-174 to four depth charge attacks over two hours until contact was lost. An Anson from No. 71 Squadron was escorting the convoy {{at the time the}} two ships were torpedoed but was low on fuel and returned to base shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> While the corvettes believed that they had sunk I-174, she was only lightly damaged and withdrew to the east. The Australian failure to sink the submarine was {{due to a lack of}} practice and too few ships being available to create an adequate search scheme.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} {{were used by}} the US Marine Corps' 1st Tank and 1st Scout Companies prior to the war. Some were {{employed}} on Western Samoa. None of those tanks saw action. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on Pearl Harbor, the Ordnance Committee determined that a few CTLS-4TAC and 4TAYs would be dispersed to the U.S. Army and employed in the Aleutian Islands campaign. Under Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM) 18526, these examples were subsequently designated as the Light Tank T16 and Light Tank T14 respectively.|$|E

The attack {{was a major}} setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers.

Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of his illness and quickly seized power, re-establishing themselves as regents and dissolving the Marmouset council.|$|E

5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E

After another man was attacked a few hours later in a similar manner, followed by a third victim in the evening, an urban legend spread that a vampire was stalking Coventry Street. No further incidents occurred and the attacker was never convicted.|$|E
