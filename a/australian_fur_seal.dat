25|$|The {{protection}} of Seal Rocks {{as a significant}} <b>Australian</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> breeding and nursery site, national and state {{protection of}} all seals in Australian waters from 1975 and dedicated scientific research has helped the population slowly recover {{from the effects of}} commercial sealing in the late 1790s – 1900's and subsequent culls by fisheries. Today, Seal Rocks supports an estimated 30,000 individuals. Marine debris has been identified {{as a threat to the}} colony, with recent research estimating 302 entanglements occurring per year on Seal Rocks with pups and juveniles most at risk due to their inquisitive and playful nature. Understanding the effects of marine debris on the population can establish more effective management of both debris sources as well as the wildlife that interacts with it.|$|E

Fur seals spend most of the year at sea, but are never too far from land. They have been recorded 160 km from land, but this is not common.|$|E

40|$|<b>Australian</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> breed on {{thirteen}} islands {{located in}} the Bass Strait, Australia. Land access to these islands is restricted, minimising human presence but boat access is still permissible with limitations on approach distances. Thirty-two controlled noise exposure experiments were conducted on breeding <b>Australian</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> to determine their behavioural response to controlled in-air motor boat noise on Kanowna Island (39 ° 10 ′S, 146 ° 18 ′E). Our results show {{there were significant differences}} in the seals 2 ̆ 7 behaviour at low (64 – 70 dB) versus high (75 – 85 dB) sound levels, with seals orientating themselves towards or physically moving away from the louder boat noise at three different sound levels. Furthermore, seals responded more aggressively with one another and were more alert when they heard louder boat noise. <b>Australian</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> demonstrated plasticity in their vocal responses to boat noise with calls being significantly different between the various sound intensities and barks tending to get faster as the boat noise got louder. These results suggest that <b>Australian</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> on Kanowna Island show behavioural disturbance to high level boat noise. Consequently, it is recommended that an appropriate level of received boat sound emissions at breeding <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> colonies be below 74 dB and that these findings be taken into account when evaluating appropriate approach distances and speed limits for boats. <br /...|$|R
50|$|Recorded {{breeding}} seabird {{species are}} the little penguin, short-tailed shearwater, fairy prion and common diving-petrel.

50|$|The African fur seal’s diet {{is made of}} up to 70% fish, 20% squid and 2% crab. Also eaten {{are other}} crustaceans, {{cephalopods}} and sometimes birds. In rare instances they have even been documented attacking and eating sharks. A recent incident occurred off Cape Point, South Africa, where a large male was observed attacking and killing five blue sharks between 1 and 1.4 metres long. Observers concluded that the seal likely killed the sharks to eat the fish rich contents of their stomachs {{as well as their}} livers as a source of energy. The <b>Australian</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> mostly eats squid, octopus, fish and lobsters. The brown fur seal dives for its food. The African subspecies can dive as deep as 204m and for as long as 7.5 minutes. The Australian subspecies generally feeds at lower depths, diving on average 120m and can reach as deep as 200m.|$|E
5000|$|Arctocephalus forsteri, the Australasian fur seal, South <b>Australian</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> New Zealand fur seal, Antipodean fur seal, or long-nosed fur seal, is {{a species}} of fur seal found around the south coast of Australia, {{the coast of the}} South Island of New Zealand, and some of the small islands to the south and east of there. While male-only colonies were also located on the Cook Strait coast of the North Island near Wellington [...] there are also {{breeding}} colonies in the North Island. A large accessible breeding colony is located at Cape Palliser, on the south-easternmost tip of the North Island and vagrants are found as far north as New Caledonia. The name New Zealand fur seal is used by English speakers in New Zealand (kekeno is used in the Māori language), and southern fur seal by speakers in Australia. As of 2014, the common name long-nosed fur seal has been proposed for the population of seals inhabiting Australia. [...] Although the Australian and New Zealand populations show some genetic differences, their morphologies are very similar, and thus they remain classed as a single species.|$|E
