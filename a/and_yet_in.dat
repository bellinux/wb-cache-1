In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.|$|E

25|$|During the Interregnum, the royalist forces {{attached}} {{to the court of}} Charles I went into exile with the twenty-year-old Charles II and conducted a brisk business in intelligence and fund-raising for an eventual return to England. Some of the royalist ladies installed themselves in convents in Holland and France that offered safe haven for indigent and travelling nobles and allies. The men similarly stationed themselves in Holland and France, with the court-in-exile being established in The Hague before setting up more permanently in Paris. The nobility who travelled with (and later travelled to) Charles II were therefore lodged {{for more than a decade}} in the midst of the continent's literary scene. As Holland and France in the 17th century were little alike, so the influences picked up by courtiers in exile and the travellers who sent intelligence and money to them were not monolithic. Charles spent his time attending plays in France, and he developed a taste for Spanish plays. Those nobles living in Holland began to learn about mercantile exchange as well as the tolerant, rationalist prose debates that circulated in that officially tolerant nation. John Bramhall, for example, had been a strongly high church theologian, <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>in</b> exile, he debated willingly with Thomas Hobbes and came into the Restored church as tolerant in practice as he was severe in argument. Courtiers also received an exposure to the Roman Catholic Church and its liturgy and pageants, as well as, to a lesser extent, Italian poetry.|$|E
25|$|Malthus went on {{to argue}} that under such ideal conditions, the {{population}} could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in {{for the support of}} the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.|$|E

500|$|Waters {{was drawn}} to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, [...] "I find it a {{fascinating}} period because it feels very close to us, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of the things we think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E
500|$|In July 1938, deHavilland {{began dating}} {{business}} tycoon, aviator, and filmmaker Howard Hughes, {{who had just}} completed his record-setting flight {{around the world in}} 91 hours. In addition to escorting her about town, he gave the actress her first flying lessons. She later said, [...] "He was a rather shy man ... <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>in</b> a whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn't do anything heroic in life, here was this man who was a real hero." [...] In December 1939, she began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart. At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick, the actor's agent asked Stewart to escort deHavilland to the New York premiere of Gone with the Wind at the Astor Theater on December 19, 1939. Over the next few days, Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club. They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles, where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance. According to deHavilland, Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940, but she felt that he was not ready to settle down. Their relationship ended in late 1941 when deHavilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making In This Our Life. [...] "John was a very great love of mine", she would later admit, [...] "He was a man I wanted to marry." ...|$|E

However, a common mistake is to think that loving oneself is necessarily equivalent to narcissism, as opposed for example to what Erik Erikson speaks of as [...] "a post-narcissistic love of the ego". [...] A person with a healthy self-esteem accepts and loves himself/herself unconditionally, acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self, <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>in</b> spite of everything, is able to continue to love her/himself.|$|E

2500|$|Ishmael is the narrator, shaping {{his story}} {{with use of}} many {{different}} genres including sermons, stage plays, soliloquies, and emblematical readings.

[...] Scholar John Bryant calls him the novel's [...] "central consciousness and narrative voice." [...] Bezanson first distinguishes Ishmael as narrator from Ishmael as character, whom he calls [...] "forecastle Ishmael", and who is the younger Ishmael of some years ago. Narrator Ishmael, then, is [...] "merely young Ishmael grown older." [...] A second distinction avoids confusion of either of both Ishmaels with the author Herman Melville.
