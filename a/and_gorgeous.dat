5|$|Sega {{released}} the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, {{at a price}} of JP¥44,800. Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special move or reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation <b>and</b> <b>gorgeous</b> sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter made people stop and look. On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine. Over to you, Sony. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210173015/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-review/ |archivedate=December 10, 2014 }} The only other first-party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection. Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn {{proved to be the}} more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of the}} Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E
25|$|When the Blonds' time in Los Angeles ended {{near the}} end of 1975, they {{returned}} to the Tri State promotion and immediately targeted the United States Tag Team championship. On March 18, 1976, the duo defeated Greg Valentine <b>and</b> <b>Gorgeous</b> George, Jr. Due to disputes over pay and billing the Blonds’ time in Tri State was short lived, they quickly dropped the tag team title to Buck Robley and Bob Slaughter only eleven days after they won them. The Blonds next appeared in CWF once more, winning the Florida Tag Team titles from Steve Keirn and Bob Backlund not long after arriving in the territory. Just like with Tri State, their stay in Florida was short, as they dropped the titles to Mike Graham and Ken Lucas only a few months later and left. After a short stay in Florida, the duo began working for Jim Crockett’s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). On January 17, 1977, Roberts and Brown defeated the team of Dino Bravo and Tim Woods for the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship and held on to it for three months until Bravo and new partner Tiger Conway Jr. beat them for the gold. During the summer of 1977, the Hollywood Blonds moved from Mid-Atlantic to Memphis and the NWA Mid-America promotion (later Continental Wrestling Association, CWA). In Memphis, the Blonds shot up the tag team ranks right off the bat defeating Bob Ellis and Jim Garvin for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on July 25. The Blonds lost the titkes to Norvell Austin and Pat Barrett on August 15. After holding the titles two more times, the team lost them for good to Austin and Barrett on September 25, 1977.|$|E

Ankeny also compared {{the music on}} the album to The Band in their prime. Pitchfork writer Neil Lieberman praised how Wilco [...] "craft an album as wonderfully ambiguous and beautifully uncertain as life itself" [...] and how Bennett [...] "paint the album in Technicolor". Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, calling it [...] "old-fashioned tunecraft lacking not pedal steel, who cares, but the concreteness modern popcraft eschews". The Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot championed the album in his review and ranked it the year's best album, calling it [...] "pop so gorgeous it belies the intricate studio experimentation that brought it to life".|$|E
500|$|... "Lovers in Japan" [...] {{received}} high commendations from critics. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{review of}} the album, wrote: [...] "Chris Martin's melodies... shine: even his loudest detractor could hardly deny his way with a tune as evidenced here by '42' and 'Lovers in Japan'." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters remarked that the song is [...] "stunning, jaw-dropping highlight". He added that [...] "Martin pounds away at a bouncy toy-piano melody... leading into a chorus where guitarist Jonny Buckland gets to unleash {{what might be the}} catchiest guitar riff he's written... (and yes, he absolutely bathes in the moment)." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle described [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] as a [...] "joyous, romantic anthem that combines wistful rock riffs <b>and</b> <b>gorgeous</b> piano". He also wrote that the song is one of [...] "the disc's best moments".|$|E

500|$|Abrams {{chose to}} shoot the film in the {{anamorphic}} format on 35 mm film after discussions about whether the film should be shot in high-definition digital video. Cinematographer Dan Mindel and Abrams agreed the choice gave the film a big-screen feel and the realistic, organic look they wanted for the film setting. Abrams and Mindel used lens flares throughout filming to create an optimistic atmosphere and a feeling that activity was taking place off-camera, making the Star Trek universe feel more real. [...] "There's something about those flares, especially in a movie that potentially could be incredibly sterile and CG and overly controlled. There's just something incredibly unpredictable <b>and</b> <b>gorgeous</b> about them." [...] Mindel would create more flares by shining a flashlight or pointing a mirror at the camera lens, or using two cameras simultaneously and therefore two lighting set-ups. Editor Mary Jo Markey later said in interview {{that he had not}} told her (or fellow editor Maryann Brandon) this, and initially contacted the film developers asking why the film seemed overexposed.|$|E

[...] Melody Maker hailed Parachutes as a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and [...] "a defining musical statement of 2000", while James Oldham of Uncut felt that the album [...] "more than justifies the plaudits heaped upon [...] by the weekly music press".

500|$|... "Follow Me Home" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. K.

[...] Talia Kraines of BBC noted the song as having a near-level standard of the group's 2003 single, [...] "Too Lost in You". QX gave the song seven out of ten stars, writing: [...] "With this film themed track they’re staying true to their roots and retain their position as leaders amidst the all-girl band rankings". Stuart Heritage of Hecklerspray wrote that the song [...] "benefits from some lovely strings <b>and</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> sultry vocals", although admitted that the single is not as exciting as the album's previous ones. Daily Records Rick Fulton described the song {{as one of the}} group's more thoughtful tracks, but admitted that it lacks [...] "bite". He applauded the Soul Seekerz Vocal Mix version as [...] "breathing life" [...] into it. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian criticised the song as tedious and stated that it [...] "is every bit as gripping as new parents foisting their baby photos on you".

And yet, for me, Barfi was a singularly frustrating experience {{there was so much}} to like, but the film never became {{more than the sum of}} its parts". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Barfi had the potential to be great cinema, but as it stands it's a respectable film that's still better than a lot else you're likely to see." [...] On the contrary, Namrata Joshi of Outlook felt that [...] "The flashback within flashback narrative gets way too clumsy and turgid, the thriller twist absolutely pointless [...] appears much too crafted <b>and</b> self-consciously <b>gorgeous,</b> <b>and</b> feels eminently facile and plastic".|$|R
