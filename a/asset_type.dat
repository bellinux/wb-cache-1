Likewise, aggregate models do not consider potential heterogeneity in investment behavior originating on the demand side for capital, e. g. at the sector level.

Using data from 23 sectors in 10 OECD countries over the period 1984 - 2007, we adopt a fully disaggregated approach – by <b>asset</b> <b>types</b> and sectors – to estimate the responsiveness of investment to the tax-adjusted user cost of capital. While accounting for the different sources of heterogeneity, we find that fixed capital accumulation is significantly affected by changes in the user cost.

5000|$|Immunization {{can be done}} in a {{portfolio}} of a single <b>asset</b> <b>type,</b> such as government bonds, by creating long and short positions along the yield curve. It is usually possible to immunize {{a portfolio}} against the most prevalent risk factors. A principal component analysis of changes along the U.S. Government Treasury yield curve reveals that more than 90% of the yield curve shifts are parallel shifts, followed by a smaller percentage of slope shifts and {{a very small percentage of}} curvature shifts. Using that knowledge, an immunized portfolio can be created by creating long positions with durations at the long and short end of the curve, and a matching short position with a duration in the middle of the curve. These positions protect against parallel shifts and slope changes, in exchange for exposure to curvature changes.|$|E

5000|$|GRAI {{is one of}} two GS1 keys for asset identification. GRAI is used to {{identify}} returnable assets, the other being the Global Individual Asset Identifier. It is for re-usable packages or transport equipment, such as crates, bread trays, pallets or beer kegs. The GRAI enables returnable assets to be identified by type or individually for tracking or sorting purposes. In simple terms this means an asset that will be sent outside the company that contains, protects or transports physical items and will be used for multiple trips. The GRAI identifies the asset being used for the purpose of tracking its location and return. It can be used for tracking purposes only or as part of a hiring or rental system where companies collaborate on the use of these assets. The GRAI is an identification key that can be used globally {{to identify}} the asset. Detailed information regarding the asset will be recorded in a database and the GRAI is the key that provides the link to that information. It may be produced as a GS1-128 bar code, or held in a GS1 EPC tag or used in a database. It is also a United States Department of Defense-recognized Item Unique Identification (IUID) equivalent, and may be encoded in an IUID-compliant DataMatrix.

5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a tri-party repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include <b>asset</b> <b>type,</b> issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|E

Risk management expresses the relation between consequences/acceptance in function of probability of occurrence of supply failures.

40|$|AbstractAs {{transportation}} infrastructure managers pursue performance-based management, increased scrutiny is rightfully {{imposed by the}} stakeholders (tax-payers and their legislative representatives). The performance of public transportation agencies is not evaluated on a single <b>asset</b> <b>type</b> (i. e. on Pavement, or Bridges alone) but on {{the system as a}} whole (cross-assets). Many commercial software packages are focused on managing a single <b>asset</b> <b>type</b> making cross-asset analysis difficult. However, a main problem for transportation agency managers is how to split available budget among different types of assets to provide the best overall performance to the public stakeholders. This paper focuses on two different approaches to the Cross-Asset Problem (CAP) and demonstrates, using real data examples, how optimal budget distribution for various asset types can be found for large agencies. The paper formulates individual asset management as an integer optimization problem (IP). It then discusses two approaches to the CAP. The first approach assumes that overall agency performance can be expressed as a linear combination of individual <b>asset</b> <b>type</b> performances. In this case the CAP can be formulated as an Integer Optimization Problem (IP) where its objective and constraints are defined as a simple linear combination of the objectives/constraints for corresponding asset types. Model formulation, running times and optimal budget distributions using real transportation agency data are presented for this approach. The second approach requires no assumptions on the CAPs objective formula and considers separate <b>asset</b> <b>type</b> problems as a black box which, for a given budget distribution, returns the best overall performance for that <b>asset</b> <b>type.</b> A Derivative Free Optimization algorithm is presented for this setup, showing running time and final budget distributions for several examples. Finally, the paper outlines {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each approach and provides guidance on when each approach should be used...|$|E

We focused our research on qualitative evaluation with 2 -dimensional asset classification. It converts from quantitative asset value with purchase cost, recovery and exchange cost, etc. to qualitative evaluation considering specific factors related to the business process. In the first phase, we classified the IT assets into tangible and intangible assets, including human and information data asset, and evaluated their value. Then, we converted the quantitative asset value to the qualitative asset value using a conversion standard table. In the second phase, we reclassified the assets using 2 -dimensional classification factors reflecting the business process, and applied weight to the first evaluation results. This method is to consider the organization characteristics, IT asset structure scheme and business process.
