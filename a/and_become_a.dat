5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} <b>and</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter.

When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E
