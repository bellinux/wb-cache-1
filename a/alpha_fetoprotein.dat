The cDNAs {{have been used}} to quantitate the number of albumin and AFP genes in different rat tissues by two independent methods, both of which yielded similar results. First, the kinetics of the association of these cDNAs with nuclear DNA from rat liver, rat kidney, and Morris hepatoma 7777 under conditions of vast DNA excess indicated that the albumin and AFP mRNAs are transcribed from ``nonrepetitive DNA. '' Second, saturation hybridization experiments in which a constant amount of rat liver DNA or Morris hepatoma 7777 was hybridized with increasing amounts of cDNA to albumin mRNA have shown the presence of 1 - 2 albumin genes per rat haploid genome. The number of AFP genes obtained in similar titration experiments was approximately 2 - 3. This was true whether rat liver DNA or hepatoma 7777 DNA was used in the reassociation experiments. When high molecular weight DNA preparations from both these tissues were digested with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI and the fragments were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, the albumin and AFP [32 P]cDNA probes hybridized to different sets of DNA fragments. However, each probe gave the same hybridization pattern whether Buffalo rat liver DNA or hepatoma 7777 DNA was utilized...|$|R

Material/Methods: During period of 64 months procedure was performed in 41 patients with non resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The combination of Lipiodol and chemotherapeutic agents were applied in a. hepatica propria and its branches via transfemorally placed catheter. Stages of neoplasms were defined by Okuda method. Results: The majority of tumors (30) were classified as Grade I. Liver cirrhosis was present in 36 patients, and abnormal levels of alpha-fetoprotein were found in 68 % of cases. Each of twenty nine patients had more than one chemoembolization therapy, therefore, a total of 85 treatments were carried out. CT scanning perfomed one month following the procedure revealed more than 75 % of Lipiodol retention in 42 % of cases, and over 90 % of neoplasm necrosis was recorded in 90 % of cases, while all treated patients manifested lower levels of <b>alpha</b> - <b>fetoprotein.</b> All patients survived during three and six months, respectively, while the survival rate was 68 % after 18 months.

This study tested our hypothesis that meaningful plasma reference ranges could be established for preterm infants by a simple correction of patient age at sampling date for gestational age deficit at birth. Using a modified radioimmunoassay kit method, determinations of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> were performed on capillary and venous blood samples collected from 56 babies aged from birth to 5 months with gestational ages ranging from 26 weeks to 43 weeks.

Acceptable reference ranges were derived using logarithmic transformation of plasma <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> values and rearrangement against patient age corrected for gestational age deficit.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary liver neoplasms and is one of the main causes of death in patients with liver cirrhosis. High <b>Alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> serum levels have been found in 60 – 70 % of patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma; nevertheless, there are other causes that increase this protein. <b>Alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> levels ≥ 200 and 400 ng/mL in patients with an identifiable liver mass by imaging techniques are diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma with high specificity. Methods We analysed the sensitivity and specificity of the progressive increase of the levels of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with liver cirrhosis. Seventy-four patients with cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma and 193 with hepatic lesions diagnosed by biopsy and shown by image scans were included. Sensitivity and specificity of transversal determination of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> ≥ 200 and 400 ng/mL and monthly progressive elevation of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> were analysed. Areas under the ROC curves were compared. Positive and negative predictive values adjusted to a 5 and 10 % prevalence were calculated. Results For an elevation of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> ≥ 200 and 400 ng/mL the specificity is of 100 % in both cases, with a sensitivity of 36. 3 and 20. 2 %, respectively. For an <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> elevation rate ≥ 7 ng/mL/month, sensitivity was of 71. 4 % and specificity of 100 %. The area under the ROC curve of the progressive elevation was significantly greater than that of the transversal determination of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein.</b> The positive and negative predictive values modified to a 10 % prevalence are of: 98. 8 % and 96. 92 %, respectively; while for a prevalence of 5 % they were of 97. 4 % and 98. 52 %, respectively. Conclusion The progressive elevation of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> ≥ 7 ng/mL/month in patients with liver cirrhosis is useful for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients that do not reach αFP levels ≥ 200 ng/mL. Prospective studies are required to confirm this observation. </p...|$|E

METHODS: <b>alpha</b> <b>Fetoprotein</b> and ferritin were chosen to demonstrate the principal of this system. The assay reagents were horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -labelled anti-alpha fetoprotein and HRP-labelled anti-ferritin antibodies. After the serum sample had been incubated with these reagents the substrate for HRP was added and the absorbance measured. An absorbance value below the cutoff point indicated that both parameters were within normal limits; a value above the cutoff point indicated {{that at least one}} of the two parameters was abnormally high.

Fifty serum samples from patients with high <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> concentrations (over 20 ng/ml) and 50 samples with high ferritin concentrations (over 200 ng/ml) were also assayed.

40|$|Introduction: Early {{diagnosis}} and prediction of preeclampsia needs appropriate obstetric care. Preeclampsia predicting methods are important. This {{study was designed}} to determine the correlation between preeclampsia and quadruple screening test in the nulliparous. Materials and Methods:  This case - control study was conducted on 54 pregnant women with preeclampsia (case group) and 108 healthy pregnant women (control group) who referred to health centers in Sanandaj, Iran. Ultrasonography was performed to determine the gestational age by a radiologist. Maternal serum levels of <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), unconjugated estriol (uE 3), and inhibin-A were measured in the second trimester of pregnancy. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software and Chi-square test, T-test, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. Results: The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of preeclampsia in pregnant women for hCG were 35. 2 % and 79. 6 respectively. These findings for estriol were 20. 4 % and 88. 9 %, for inhibin-A were 38. 8 % and 88 % and for <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> were 38. 8 % and 74. 1 %. The positive predictive value for hCG, estriol, inhibin-A and <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> were 46. 3 %, 47. 8 %, 61. 8 % and 42. 9 % respectively. The negative predictive value for hCG, estriol, inhibin-A and <b>alpha</b> <b>fetoprotein</b> were also 71 %, 69. 1 %, 74. 2 % and 70. 8 % respectively.
