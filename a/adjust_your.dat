5|$|Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a {{pilot for}} a TV series in 1975, Out of the Trees, but it {{received}} poor ratings after being broadcast {{at the same}} time as Match of the Day and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.|$|E
25|$|Following The Frost Report the Palin/Jones team worked both as {{actors and}} writers {{on the show}} Twice a Fortnight with Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Jonathan Lynn, and the {{successful}} children's comedy show Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set with Idle and David Jason. The show also featured musical numbers by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, including future Monty Python musical collaborator Neil Innes. The animations for Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set were made by Terry Gilliam. Eager to work with Palin sans Jones, Cleese later asked him to perform in How to Irritate People together with Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The Palin/Jones team were reunited for The Complete and Utter History of Britain.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, {{according}} to John Cleese's autobiography, {{the origins of}} Monty Python lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.|$|E

25|$|Idle {{started at}} Cambridge {{only a year}} after future fellow-Pythons Graham Chapman and John Cleese. He became Footlights President in 1965 {{and was the first}} to allow women to join the club. Idle starred in the children's {{television}} comedy series Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set co-starring his future Python fellows Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Terry Gilliam provided animations for the show. The show's cast also included comic actors David Jason and Denise Coffey. Idle also appeared as guest in some episodes of the television series At Last the 1948 Show, which co-featured Cleese and Chapman.|$|E
25|$|It {{was as a}} {{performer}} on The Frost Report that Cleese achieved his breakthrough on British television as a comedy actor, appearing as the tall, patrician figure in the classic class sketch, contrasting comically in a line-up with the shorter, middle class Ronnie Barker and the even shorter, working class Ronnie Corbett. This series was so popular that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on At Last the 1948 Show, during which time the Four Yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writers/performers (the Four Yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a Monty Python sketch). Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of Doctor in the House (and later Cleese wrote six episodes of Doctor at Large on his own in 1971). These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered their very own series. However, owing to Chapman's alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was, therefore, unenthusiastic about doing a series with {{just the two of}} them. He had found working with Palin on The Frost Report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series. Palin had previously been working on Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set with Idle and Jones, with Terry Gilliam creating the animations. The four of them had, {{on the back of the}} success of Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set, been offered a series for Thames Television, which they were waiting to begin when Cleese's offer arrived. Palin agreed to work with Cleese and Chapman in the meantime, bringing with him Gilliam, Jones, and Idle.|$|E
25|$|On the {{strength}} of their work on The Frost Report and other programmes, Cleese and Chapman had been offered a show by the BBC, but Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, among them Chapman's reputedly difficult personality. During this period Cleese contacted Palin about doing the show that would ultimately become Monty Python's Flying Circus. At the same time the success of Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set had led Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam to be offered their own series and, while it was still in production, Palin agreed to Cleese's proposal and brought along Idle, Jones and Gilliam. Thus the formation of the Monty Python troupe has been referred to as a result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.|$|E

A few examples of these nervous actions may include {{but are not limited to}} clenching <b>your</b> hands, <b>adjusting</b> <b>your</b> hair or clothing, and pacing back and forth while speaking. These actions may lead to a disinterest in the context of a speech and an elevated interest in the person speaking or the environment surrounding them.|$|R

They created the one of the original seats designed for the Segway self-balancing powered mobility device. These first-generation seat kits attached to a post installed onto the Segway, but they did not perfectly serve the physically-disabled because they did not provide the features required to keep the rider safe while transferring to and from their wheelchair. Recently, more and more inventions are being created and patented. It is this collection of inventions that are making the category of 'self-balancing' wheelchair or 'self-balancing mobility device seat-kits' come alive and come to mean more than simply an alternate form of a wheelchair.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set, a tea-time children's programme, ITV offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together. At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the BBC, which had been {{impressed}} by their work on The Frost Report and At Last the 1948 Show. Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on How To Irritate People and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at ITV until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much {{has been made of}} the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.|$|E

2500|$|After much debate, Jones remembered an {{animation}} Gilliam {{had created}} for Do Not <b>Adjust</b> <b>Your</b> Set called [...] "Beware of the Elephants", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style.

Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the Flying Circus series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single stream-of-consciousness (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{interest}} in studying the dimensions and prediction of task and contextual performance, little empirical {{attention has been given}} to studying the nature of soft skills performance. Soft skills (i. e., intra- and inter-personal work skills that facilitate the application of technical skills and knowledge), such as interpersonal skills (e. g., developing rapport) and communication skills (e. g., <b>adjusting</b> <b>your</b> message to the target audience) are highly sought by organizations (Zedeck and Goldstein, 2000). However, {{little is known about the}} underlying dimensions of soft skills performance, or about the individual differences variables that predict performance in this domain. In the current set of studies I examined the dimensionality of soft skills performance, developed measures to assess soft skills performance from self and supervisor perspectives, and validated the measures of performance in a nomological network of non-ability individual differences and existing performance measures. Study 1 involved asking subject matter experts to provide a master list and critical incidents of soft skills. Data from Study 1 served as the stimuli in Study 2 for sorting and reduction of skills into dimensions of soft skills performance. A construct and criterion validation approach was taken in Study 3 to measure soft skills performance in relation to individual differences variables in a nomological network. Results showed that the taxonomy of soft skills performance was composed of seven clusters, but that the measure of soft skills performance was unidimensional. Personality and motivational variables significantly predicted soft skills performance through their influence on proximal motivational processes. Ph. D.
