50|$|<b>Azacosterol</b> (INN), or <b>azacosterol</b> {{hydrochloride}} (USAN) (brand name Ornitrol), {{also known}} as 20,25-diazacholesterol, is a cholesterol-lowering drug (hypocholesteremic) which was marketed previously but has since been discontinued. It is also an avian chemosterilant used to control the pest pigeon population via inducing sterility. The drug is a sterol and derivative of cholesterol in which two carbon atoms have been replaced with nitrogen atoms.|$|E
5000|$|... 24-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (24-DHCR) inhibitors such as <b>azacosterol</b> and {{triparanol}} {{inhibit the}} production of cholesterol from desmosterol, {{one of the last}} steps in cholesterol biosynthesis, and were formerly used to treat hypercholesterolemia, but were withdrawn from the market due to toxicity caused by accumulation of desmosterol in tissues.|$|E
50|$|Colestolone {{has been}} found to {{significantly}} reduce serum levels of cholesterol both in animals and in humans. It inhibits multiple relatively early-stage steps in cholesterol biosynthesis such as HMG-CoA reductase and does not appear to affect any late-stage steps (after squalene, specifically). Unlike late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors like triparanol and <b>azacosterol,</b> no accumulation of sterols has been observed in animals treated with colestolone, suggesting that it does not share the toxicity of late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azacosterol</b> {{acts as an}} {{inhibitor}} of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (24-DHCR), {{preventing the}} formation of cholesterol from desmosterol. Although it primarily acts to inhibit 24-DHCR, the drug also inhibits other steps in cholesterol biosynthesis. The anti-fertility effects of the drug in birds are mediated by inhibition of steroid hormone production, steroid hormones being synthesized from cholesterol. Due to prevention of the metabolism of desmosterol, the drug causes it to accumulate, in turn producing side effects such as hyperkeratosis, particularly of the palms and soles.|$|E
40|$|The total {{scope of}} {{chemosterilant}}s is very wide so I will comment {{only on the}} pigeon chemosterilant developed by G. D. Searle 2 ̆ 6 Co. and then briefly {{on the role of}} chemosterilants, generally, in bird control.
