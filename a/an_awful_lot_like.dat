500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, {{the song}} was [...] "a {{perfectly}} decent slice of midtempo Timba-pop, but it's not really {{in the same league}} as the brilliant 'The Way I Are'." [...] MTV Buzzworthy said [...] "slightly less out-there are the beats -- which sound <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Hilson and Timbaland's first collaboration, [...] "The Way I Are"—and the cameo from Timba himself." [...] Sophie Bruce of BBC Music thought that the song lacked the a catchy hook such as in [...] "The Way I Are." [...] Less than impressed with Timbaland's rapping and [...] "less than sexy" [...] vocal appeal, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said the [...] "unfortunate pairing" [...] was reprised, and the song [...] "encapsulates the record’s shortcomings." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, but wrote: [...] "Flashes of brilliance aside, the result sounds <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> something Yorke dashed off {{to pass the}} time before delving into the new Radiohead album." [...] Mark Beaumont of the Guardian called it [...] "deviously understated", but found that its unconventional release was [...] "more impactful than the product." [...] Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "There's precious little to grab on to in terms of melody and feeling, and you won't find yourself humming along to anything here. That said, certain elements of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, if given the right amount of attention, can be enjoyable to luxuriate in." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times found the album too similar to Yorke's 2006 solo album The Eraser and his work with Atoms for Peace, writing that [...] "it’s just a bit disappointing that Yorke's path seems short on new directions." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} if it works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's hard to say whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed that he would have [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for The 3rd Degree {{have been}} mixed. Iain Weaver from UKGameshows gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} series, saying: [...] "We're not tremendously upset {{by the way the}} teachers went through the series unbeaten, they are university lecturers, and university lecturers are meant to know <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot.</b> We also <b>liked</b> the way Steve Punt kept the programme flowing at a decent pace, adding jokes and asides, and keeping proceedings moving along most enjoyably. He's probably helped by the audience at the student bar, who have doubtlessly taken this opportunity to have their one pint of something for the week. If there's one slight criticism we'd make, it's that the Highbrow Lowbrow round {{is a bit of a}} block in the middle of the programme. We might prefer to split the round into two parts, perhaps shifting the first immediately before the lists round. That would add a little bit more variety, and make the programme a little less imposing. That's just a minor criticism: most of what The 3rd Degree does, it does well. Given that it replaced the venerable Quote... Unquote, it didn't have a high bar, but we can see this programme running for a fair few years." ...|$|R

Well, I {{want to do that}} just as much as ever. But there's something that's a whole lot more important. Somehow, I ain't ever had many friends. Some ways you're about the best friend I've ever had--you ain't neither too highbrow or too lowbrow. And this friendship business--it means such <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot.</b> It's <b>like</b> what I was reading about--something by Elbert Hubbard or--thunder, I can't remember his name, but, anyway, it's one of those poet guys that writes for the back page of the Journal--something about a joyous adventure. That's what being friends is. Course you understand I wouldn't want to say this to most people, but you'll understand how I mean. It's--this friendship business is just like those old crusaders-- you know--they'd start out on a fine morning--you know; armor shining, all that stuff. It wouldn't make any dif. what they met as long as they was fighting together. Rainy nights with folks sneaking through the rain to get at 'em, and all sorts of things-- ready for anything, long as they just stuck together. That's the way this friendship business is, I b'lieve. Just like it said in the Journal. Yump, sure is. Gee! it's--Chance to tell folks what you think and really get some fun out of seeing places together. And I ain't ever done it much. Course I don't mean to say I've been living off on any blooming desert island all my life, but, just the same, I've always been kind of alone--not knowing many folks. You know how it is in a New York rooming-house. So now--Aw, don't slip up on me, Morty. Honestly, I don't care what kind of work we do {{as long as we can}} stick together; I don't care a hang if we don't get anything better to do than scrub floors!" ...|$|R

500|$|... "Wings" [...] {{received}} acclaim from critics. Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{said the}} group were poised to succeed [...] "where other X Factor winners have failed by releasing a great single at the right time". Cragg highlighted the song's production, writing that it had [...] "everything you'd want to hear in a pop song in 2012", and likened Little Mix's [...] "ridiculous vocal runs" [...] to those of Christina Aguilera. Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all shot through with such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera." [...] Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a rating of nine out of ten, regarding it as [...] "vivacious, fun, brash and confident", and noting its [...] "absolute belter of a chorus". Rivers concluded: [...] "'Wings' is really pretty darn good. Not just good-for-X-Factor good, but good-in-the-context-of-all-pop-music good." ...|$|E

2500|$|... {{the world}} Atwood imagines in Oryx and Crake is hardly that far-fetched, {{especially}} online. The exhibitionistic website At Home With Anna K, for instance, {{is almost certainly}} a reference to Ana Voog's AnaCam and the lifecasting movement pioneered by Jennifer Ringley and her now-defunct JenniCam website. Likewise, {{many of the other}} fictional websites Jimmy and Crake visit in the novel have real-life analogues: Felicia's Frog Squash is essentially a crush porn portal, the premise of dirtysockpuppets.com recalls ITV's Spitting Image programme, Queek Geek sounds <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Fear Factor, and the concept of watching assisted suicides on nitee-nite.com was actualized in our world when Craig Ewert allowed his death in Switzerland to be documented by Sky TV for their controversial Right to Die documentary. Even the seemingly far-fetched idea of broadcasting live executions (which Jimmy and Crake watch on shortcircuit.com, brainfrizz.com, and deathrowlive.com) has already been discussed, with a high percentage of the U.S. population receptive to the concept.|$|E
