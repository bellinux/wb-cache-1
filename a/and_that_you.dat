5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

You may say that you go to work with bright hopes, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.|$|E

500|$|A career-high 23 goals led Suter's 81-point {{campaign}} in 1992–93, but he again struggled {{with a pair}} of knee injuries that caused him to miss three months of the 1993–94 season and limited him to 25 games for the Flames. His tenure with Calgary ended on March 10, 1994, when the team included him in a six-player trade. [...] The Flames sent Suter, along with Paul Ranheim and Ted Drury, to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for James Patrick, Zarley Zalapski and Michael Nylander. The move surprised Suter: [...] "Calgary's meant a great deal to me. You always hear how trades are part of the game <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't have any control over them. When it happens, it's a shock. It just blows me away." ...|$|E

According to MacFarlane, the episode {{polarized}} viewers, who either [...] "hated or loved the violence". Ryan J. Budke from AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, specifically praising the scene in which Stewie beats up Brian. Budke also {{said that it was}} [...] "fun" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could tell the crew had a good time making it. Overall, he considered it [...] "not a bad episode.

500|$|Diane Johnson, who co-wrote the {{screenplay}} for The Shining with Kubrick, {{notes that he}} [...] "always {{said that it was}} better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he's always done, except with Lolita". When deciding on a subject for a film, {{there were a number of}} aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would [...] "appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film". According to his co-producer Jan Harlan, Kubrick mostly [...] "wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance". Kubrick himself believed that audiences quite often were attracted to [...] "enigmas and allegories" [...] and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} leaves it mysterious, early script drafts {{made clear that}} HAL's {{breakdown}} is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about {{the purpose of the}} mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel 2010). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is [...] "...something about this mission that we weren't told. Something {{the rest of the crew}} knows <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know. We would like to know whether this is true", to which HAL responds: [...] "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know." [...] HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.|$|E
500|$|Before {{embarking on}} the storyline, the show's {{producers}} consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation {{to ensure they}} maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything, either, and write from {{a place where they}} didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too.

500|$|The {{intervention}} of the Rothschilds bore the quickest fruit in Austria. The head of the Rothschild family bank in Vienna, Salomon Mayer von Rothschild, played the key role in raising financing for the Austrian Empire, {{and he had a}} very close relationship with the Austrian chancellor von Metternich. On April 10, Metternich dispatched instruction regarding both the Damascus and Rhodes affairs to Bartholomäus von Stürmer, ambassador in Constantinople, and Anton von Laurin, consul in Alexandria. In his dispatch, Metternich wrote: [...] "The accusation that Christians are deliberately murdered for some blood-thirsty Passover festival is by its nature absurd…" [...] Regarding the Rhodes case, the chancellor instructed von Stürmer [...] "to tip the wink to the Turkish regime, so that they instruct pasha of Rhodes accordingly <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> let [...] vice-consul in Rhodes know that in such cases he should work in the spirit of sensible mediation." [...] Von Stürmer, responded, [...] "here have been no persecutions against the Jewish population, at least not by the authorities." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the iPhone 5S, the German Chaos Computer Club {{announced}} on September 21, 2013 that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using [...] "easy everyday means". The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access. The spokesman for the group stated, [...] "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> leave everywhere every day as a security token." [...] However, in 2013, 39% of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone. Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club's method, but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort, given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint, special chemicals and expensive equipment, and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve.|$|E
500|$|He began rapping {{his poems}} {{in the eighth}} grade, and upon hearing Nas' 1996 album, It Was Written, began to pursue hip hop. [...] While {{attending}} Thornton Township High School, Fiasco met gang member Bishop G. [...] The two became friends due to their shared interest in music. [...] Fiasco's father allowed him and Bishop to make mixtapes in his basement, and the two gained notoriety at the school for their music. [...] However, they were kicked off stage during their first performance because their eclectic musical style was not embraced by the hip hop community. [...] Early in his career, he went by stage names Little Lu and Lu tha Underdog. Growing up, Fiasco was given the nickname [...] "Lu", {{the last part of}} his first name, by his mother.
