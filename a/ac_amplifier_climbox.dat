40|$|<b>AC</b> <b>amplifiers</b> can {{introduce}} significant distortions into the low frequency and DC components of recorded electrophysiological data such as event-related potentials ~ERPs!. Methods for correcting such distortions ~i. e., estimating the waveform {{of the original}} data! after the data have been amplified and recorded rely on an accurate estimate of the amplifier’s time constant ~TC!. We show that the filter characteristics of <b>AC</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{in at least some}} commercially available ERP recording instruments may vary considerably across individual channels, even when each houses an identical <b>AC</b> <b>amplifier</b> circuit. Clearly, distortion correction methods must take this variability into account. We propose an empirical means of estimating the correct TC value. This approach yields more accurate correction than those based on TCs calculated analytically.

2500|$|... 1949: A chopper-stabilized op-amp. In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg {{designed}} a chopper-stabilized op-amp. This set-up uses a normal op-amp {{with an additional}} <b>AC</b> <b>amplifier</b> that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from DC by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60Hz or 400Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp ICs started {{to show up in}} the field.|$|R
50|$|One classic {{use for a}} chopper {{circuit and}} where the term is still in use is in chopper amplifiers. These are DC amplifiers. Some types of signals that need amplifying can be so small that an {{incredibly}} high gain is required, but very high gain DC amplifiers are much harder to build with low offset and 1/ noise, and reasonable stability and bandwidth. It's much easier to build an <b>AC</b> <b>amplifier</b> instead. A chopper circuit is used {{to break up the}} input signal {{so that it can be}} processed as if it were an AC signal, then integrated back to a DC signal at the output. In this way, extremely small DC signals can be amplified. This approach is often used in electronic instrumentation where stability and accuracy are essential; for example, it is possible using these techniques to construct pico-voltmeters and Hall sensors.|$|R

Field potentials were recorded using Teflon-coated (50  µm) tungsten electrodes, referenced to a silver/silver-chloride electrode located in the recording bath. Up to four recording electrodes were positioned equidistant apart in the cerebral cortex, with no particular cortical location targeted. The data was recorded with a 1000 × gain, low- and high pass filtered at 1000 and 1.0  Hz respectively (Model 1800 <b>AC</b> <b>amplifier,</b> A-M Systems, USA) and sampled at a frequency of 5000 samples/second (Power 1401, Cambridge Electronic Designs, UK).

50|$|Of special interest, this solves {{two common}} and vexing {{problems}} encountered in optical heterodyne detection. First, Heterodyned signals are beat frequencies between the signal source and a reference source (dubbed local oscillator). They are not DC light levels but oscillating signals and thus unlike conventional detectors the light flux from the signal cannot be integrated on a capacitor. Therefore, {{to have an}} array of pixels, each pixel must be backed by <b>AC</b> <b>amplifier</b> and detection circuit which is complex. With Synthetic array detection, all the signals can be amplified and detected by the same circuit. The second problem Synthetic array detection solves arrises, not in pixel imaging but, when the signal is not spatially coherent {{across the surface of}} the detector. In this case, the beat frequencies arising are differently phased across the detector surface and these destructively interfere producing a low signal output. In synthetic array detection, each region of the detector has a different fundamental for its beat frequency and thus there is no stationary interference even if the signal's phase varies {{across the surface of the}} detector.|$|R

In terms of performance, the sensor’s capacitance (measured in a laboratory prototype) increases up to 5 % when the volumetric water content of the porous ceramic changed from 3 % to 36 %, resulting in a sensitivity of S = 15. 5 pF per unity change.

40|$|In pre-surgical {{evaluation}} of epilepsy, {{there has been}} an increased interest in the study of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity outside the 1 - 70 Hz band of conventional frequency activity (CFA). Research {{over the last couple of}} decades has shown that EEG activity in the 70 - 600 Hz range, termed high frequency oscillations (HFOs), can be recorded intracranially from all brain regions both interictally and at seizure onset. In patients with epilepsy, HFOs are now considered as pathologic regardless of their frequency band although it may be difficult to distinguish them from the physiologic HFOs, which occur in a similar frequency range. Interictal HFOs are likely to be confined mostly to the seizure onset zone, thus providing a new measure for localizing it. More importantly, several studies have linked HFOs to underlying epileptogenicity, suggesting that HFOs can serve as potential biomarkers for the illness. Along with HFOs, analysis of ictal baseline shifts (IBS; or direct current shifts) and infraslow activity (ISA) (ISA: < 0. 1 Hz) has also attracted attention. Studies have shown that: IBSs can be recorded using the routine <b>AC</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with long time constants; IBSs occur at the time of conventional EEG onset, but in a restricted spatial distribution compared with conventional frequencies; and inclusion of IBS contacts in the resection can be associated with favorable seizure outcome. Only a handful of studies have evaluated all the EEG frequencies together in the same patient group. The latter studies suggest that the seizure onset is best localized by the ictal HFOs, the IBSs tend to provide a broader localization and the conventional frequencies could be non-localizing. However, small number of patients included in these studies precludes definitive conclusions regarding post-operative seizure outcome based on selective or combined resection of HFO, IBS and CFA contacts. Large, preferably prospective, studies are needed to further evaluate the implications of different EEG frequencies in epilepsy...|$|R

40|$|The {{instrumentation}} amplifier (IA) {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} blocks in an electrocardiogram recording system. It is the first block in the analog front-end chain that processes the ECG signal from the human body and thus it defines {{some of the most important}} specifications of the ECG system like the noise and common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The extremely low ECG signal bandwidth also makes it difficult to achieve a fully integrated system. 	In this thesis, a fully integrated IA topology is presented that achieves low noise levels and low power dissipation. The chopper stabilized technique is implemented together with an <b>AC</b> coupled <b>amplifier</b> to reduce the effect of flicker noise while eliminating the effect of the differential electrode offset (DEO). An ultra low power operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is the only active power consuming block in the IA and so an overall low power consumption is achieved.

The proposed IA operates on a 2 V supply and consumes a total current of 1. 4 ?A while achieving an integrated noise of 1. 2 ?Vrms within the bandwidth. The proposed IA will relax the power and noise requirements of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that immediately follows it in the signal chain and thus reduce the cost and increase the lifetime of the recording device.

40|$|We {{investigated}} optical changes {{associated with}} crustacean nerve stimulation using birefringent and large angle scattered light. Improved detection schemes disclosed high temporal {{structure of the}} optical signals and allowed further investigations of biophysical mechanisms responsible for such changes. Most studies of physiological activity in neuronal tissue use techniques that measure the electrical behavior or ionic permeability of the nerve, such as voltage or ion sensitive dyes injected into cells, or invasive electric recording apparatus. While these techniques provide high resolution, they are detrimental to tissue and do not easily lend themselves to clinical applications in humans. Electrical and chemical components of neural excitation evoke physical responses observed through changes in scattered and absorbed light. This method is suited for in-vivo applications. Intrinsic optical changes have shown themselves to be multifaceted in nature and point to several different physiological processes that occur with different time courses during neural excitation. Fast changes occur concomitantly with electrical events, and slow changes parallel metabolic events including changes in blood flow and oxygenation. Previous experiments with isolated crustacean nerves {{have been used to}} study the biophysical mechanisms of fast optical changes. However, they have been confounded by multiple superimposed action potentials which make it difficult to discriminate the temporal signatures of individual optical responses. Often many averages were needed to adequately resolve the signal. More recently, optical signals have been observed in single trials. Initially large angle scattering measurements were used to record these events with much of the signal coming from cellular swelling associated with water influx during activation. By exploiting the birefringent properties derived from the molecular stiucture of nerve membranes, signals appear larger with a greater contrast, but direct comparison of birefringent and 90 {sup o} scattering signals has not been reported. New developments in computer and optical technology allow optical recording with higher temporal resolution than could be achieved previously. This has led us to undertake more detailed studies of the biophysical mechanisms underlying these transient changes. Optimization of this technology in conjunction with other technical developments presents a path to noninvasive dynamic clinical observation of optical responses. To conduct these optical recordings, we placed dissected leg, claw and ventral cord nerves from crayfish and lobster in a recording chamber constructed from black Delrin. The chamber consisted of several wells situated perpendicularly to the long axis of the nerve that could beelectrically isolated for stimulating and recording electrical activation, and a window in the center for optical measurements. To measure the birefringence from the nerve, light from a 120 W halogen bulb was focused onto the nerve from below the window through a 10 X microscope objective and polarized at a 45 degree angle with respect to the long axis of the nerve bundle. A second polarizer turned 90 degrees with respect to the first polarizer was placed on top of the chamber and excluded direct source illumination, passing only birefringent light from the nerve. A large area photodiode placed directly on top of the polarizer detected the magnitude of the birefringent light. To measure light scattered 90 degrees by the nerve, a short length of image conduit placed perpendicularly to the nerve directed large angle scattered light from the nerve to a second photodiode. The output of each photodiode was amplified by a first stage amplifier which produced a DC level output, and was coupled to an <b>AC</b> <b>amplifier</b> (0. 3 Hz High Pass) with a gain of 1000 to optimally record changes across time...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to explore some of these phenomena by measuring electro-myographical responses from the uterus of intact and ovariectomized ewes both before and during their normal breeding season. Six healthy non-pregnant Romney ewes of about 50 kg body weight were selected for the investigations which were carried out between September 1987 and February 1988. Electrodes, usually in groups of three, were surgically implanted at preselected sites (cervix, uterine body, uterine horn, oviduct) on the reproductive tract of the ewes, leads plugged into a universal <b>AC</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and the output recorded on a four channel ink writing chart recorder. Four of the six ewes were ovariectomized at the time of implantation of the electrodes. Indwelling silastic catheters were inserted into the external jugular veins of these ewes to enable oxytocin to be injected without disturbing the animal. All ewes were housed individually indoors in pens that allowed them to move freely during recording sessions. Recordings began about 10 days after surgery had been carried out. The electromyographs (emgs) were described using generally accepted terms such as the presence of spikes, their amplitude, the presence of bursts and of episodes of activity, whether electrical activity was co-ordinated or unco-ordinated, and the direction of propagation of the activity. A motility index (MI) was derived as a method of measuring electrical activity of the uterus over prolonged periods of time. During the anoestrous period in both intact and ovariectomized ewes an emg pattern of myoelectrical complexes characterised by alternating phases of coordinated bursts of electrical activity and quiescent periods were observed. This basic pattern of activity, and responsiveness to uterine stimulants such as oxytocin and Glandin N (a PGF 2 α analogue), was greater in the intact ewes as compared to the ovariectomized ewes at this time. Although such a difference could be anticipated, a clear answer as to whether it is a general phenomenon, or whether seasonal differences exist, could not be determined because of the limitations in design of this study. A distinct pattern of emg activity was also identified during different phases of the oestrous cycle in the ewe during the natural breeding season. This pattern could be mimicked by administration of the exogenous steroid hormones oestrogen and progesterone in the ovariectomized ewes. Four days after daily oestradiol- 17 b injections (50 μg. s. c.) the emgs of the ovariectomized ewes showed a marked increase in amplitude and in burst frequency and a considerably increased response to oxytocin and Glandin N. When this was followed by progesterone administration (50 mg. s. c), even with oestrogen injections continuing, inhibition of activity and reduced responsiveness to oxytocin and Glandin N was equally marked. Withdrawal of progesterone, but with continuing oestrogen administration, resulted in a recovery from the inhibition and a response that was even greater than before the progesterone had been given. This suggests both an inhibiting and a potentiating action of progesterone on uterine electrical activity, a finding which adds some support to Csapo's classical withdrawal of the 'progesterone block' as one of the pre-requisites for initiation of normal parturition in sheep. While oestrogen has a clear role to play as a stimulator of electrical activity it also seems capable of exhibiting a biphasic response with a period of depressed activity occurring before the positive stimulus occurs. Whether this is a function of dose or some other factor could not be established in this study. Its potentiating effect on the action of both oxytocin and Glandin N in these experiments adds further significance to the attention that should be paid to the reproductive status of the animal when clinical use is made of these substances. The direction of propagation of action potentials recorded in these studies depended on the general level of emg activity. When this was low the direction of propagation was cervico-tubal, when high, the proportion of action potentials is in both directions from the tubal end of the uterus. A clear understanding of such a mechanism, and its significance, must await further study...|$|R
40|$|A {{complementary}} {{metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) lock-in pixel to observe stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) using a high speed lateral electric field modulator (LEFM) for photo-generated charges and in-pixel readout circuits is presented. An effective SRS signal generated after the SRS process is very small {{and needs to be}} extracted from an extremely large offset due to a probing laser signal. In order to suppress the offset components while amplifying high-frequency modulated small SRS signal components, the lock-in pixel uses a high-speed LEFM for demodulating the SRS signal, resistor-capacitor low-pass filter (RC-LPF) and switched-capacitor (SC) integrator with a fully CMOS differential <b>amplifier.</b> <b>AC</b> (modulated) components remained in the RC-LPF outputs are eliminated by the phase-adjusted sampling with the SC integrator and the demodulated DC (unmodulated) components due to the SRS signal are integrated over many samples in the SC integrator. In order to suppress further the residual offset and the low frequency noise (1 /f noise) components, a double modulation technique is introduced in the SRS signal measurements, where the phase of high-frequency modulated laser beam before irradiation of a specimen is modulated at an intermediate frequency and the demodulation is done at the lock-in pixel output. A prototype chip for characterizing the SRS lock-in pixel is implemented and a successful operation is demonstrated. The reduction effects of residual offset and 1 /f noise components are confirmed by the measurements. A ratio of the detected small SRS to offset a signal of less than 10 − 5 is experimentally demonstrated, and the SRS spectrum of a Benzonitrile sample is successfully observed...|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{progress}} has been made in op amp DC characteristics. Carefully executed designs currently available provide sub-microvolt VOS ΔT drift, low bias currents and open-loop gains exceeding one million. Considerable design and processing advances were required to achieve these specifications. Because of this, it is interesting to note that amplifiers with even better DC specification were available in 1963 (Philbrick Researches Model SP 656). Although these modular amplifiers were large and expensive (≈ 3 " × 2 " × 1. 5 " at $ 195. 00 1963 dollars) by modern standards, their DC performance anticipated today’s best monolithic amplifiers while using relatively primitive components. This was accomplished by employing chopper-stabilization techniques (see Box “Choppers, Chopper-Stabilization and the LTC ® 1052 ”) instead of the more common DC-differential stage approach. The chopper-stabilized approach, developed by E. A. Goldberg in 1948, uses the amplifier’s input to amplitude modulate an AC carrier. This carrier, amplified and synchronously demodulated back to DC, furnishes the amplifier’s output. Because the DC input is translated to and amplified as an <b>AC</b> signal, the <b>amplifier’s</b> DC terms have no effect on overall drift. This is the reason chopper-stabilized amplifiers are able to achieve significantly lower time and temperature drifts than classic differential types. Additionally, the AC processing of the signal aids low frequency amplifier noise performance and eliminates many of the careful design and layout procedures necessary in a classic differential approach. The most significant trade-off is increased complexity. The chopping circuitry and sampled data operation of these amplifi ers require signifi cant attention for good results. Additionally, the AC dynamics of chopper-stabilized amplifiers are complex if bandwidths greater than the chopping carrier frequency are required. The LTC 1052 is a third generation monolithic chopperstabilized amplifier. As the table in Figure 1 shows, it is significantly better than previous monolithic chopper-stabilized amplifiers in several areas. For comparison purposes...|$|R
40|$|The AMP 01 is a {{monolithic}} instrumentation amplifier designed for high-precision data acquisition and instrumentation applications. The design combines the conventional features of an instrumentation amplifier {{with a high}} current output stage. The output remains stable with high capacitance loads (1 µF), a unique ability for an instrumentation amplifier. Consequently, the AMP 01 can amplify low level signals for transmission through long cables without requiring an output buffer. The output stage may be configured as a voltage or current generator. Input offset voltage is very low (20 µV), which generally eliminates the external null potentiometer. Temperature changes have minimal effect on offset; TCVIOS is typically 0. 15 µV/°C. Excellent low-frequency noise performance is achieved with a minimal compromise on input protection. Bias current is very low, less than 10 nA over the military temperature range. High common-mode rejection of 130 dB, 16 -bit linearity at a gain of 1000, and 50 mA peak output current are achievable simultaneously. This combination takes the instrumentation amplifier one step further towards the ideal <b>amplifier.</b> <b>AC</b> performance complements the superb dc specifications. The AMP 01 slews at 4. 5 V/µs into capacitive loads of up to 15 nF, settles in 50 µs to 0. 01 % at a gain of 1000, and boasts a healthy 26 MHz gain-bandwidth product. These features make the AMP 01 ideal for high speed data acquisition systems. Gain is set by the ratio of two external resistors over a range of 0. 1 to 10, 000. A very low gain temperature coefficient of 10 ppm/°C is achievable over the whole gain range. Output voltage swing is guaranteed with three load resistances; 50 Ω, 500 Ω, and 2 kΩ. Loaded with 500 Ω, the output delivers ± 13. 0 V minimum. A thermal shutdown circuit prevents destruction of the output transistors during overload conditions. The AMP 01 can also be configured as a high performance operational amplifier. In many applications, the AMP 01 {{can be used in}} place of op amp/power-buffer combinations...|$|R
