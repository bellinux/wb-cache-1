Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to drive away or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why the American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E
25|$|Power ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are mostly}} specified for {{much higher than}} 200 volt-amps. The great plasticity of ceramic raw material and the high dielectric strength of ceramics deliver solutions for many applications and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the enormous diversity of styles within the family of power ceramic capacitors. These power capacitors {{have been on the}} market for decades. They are produced according to the requirements as class 1 power ceramic capacitors with high stability and low losses or class 2 power ceramic capacitors with high volumetric efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for the use of}} polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E

25|$|The {{theology}} of Ezekiel is notable for {{its contribution to}} the emerging notion of individual responsibility to God – each man would be held responsible only for his own sins. This is {{in marked contrast to}} the Deuteronomistic writers, who held that the sins of the nation would be held against all, without regard for an individual's personal guilt. Nonetheless, Ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the Deuteronomists, notably the notion that God works according to the principle of retributive justice and an ambivalence towards kingship (although the Deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself). As a priest, Ezekiel praises the Zadokites over the Levites (lower level temple functionaries), whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile. He is clearly connected with the Holiness Code and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the Laws of God and maintaining ritual purity. Notably, Ezekiel blames the Babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the Law, but on their worship of gods other than Yahweh and their injustice: these, says Ezekiel in chapters 8–11, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> God's Shekhinah left his city and his people.|$|E
25|$|The genus Wollemia shares {{morphological}} characteristics {{with the}} genera Araucaria and Agathis. Wollemia and Araucaria both have closely crowned sessile and amphistomatic leaves, and aristate bract scales, while Wollemia and Agathis both have fully fused bracts, ovuliferous scales, and winged seeds. Scrutiny of {{the fossil record}} likewise does not clarify Wollemia’s relationship to Araucaria or Agathis, since the former has similarly disparate leaf characters in its adult and juvenile forms, and the latter has similar cone characters. Further, the recent description of several extinct genera within the Araucariaceae points to complex relationships within the family and a significant loss of diversity since the Cretaceous. An early study of the rbcL gene sequence places Wollemia in the basal position of the Araucariaceae and as the sister group to Agathis and Araucaria. In contrast, another study of the rbcL sequence shows that Wollemia is the sister group to Agathis and Araucaria is basal. The different outgroup selection and genes used in previous studies <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> behind the discrepancy over the groupings of the three genera. Later genetic studies corroborate Wollemias placement in the Araucariaceae as sister to Agathis {{based on data from}} the 28s rRNA gene, a combination of rbcL and matK genes, and a comprehensive study encompassing nuclear ribosomal 18S and 26S rRNA, chloroplast 16S rRNA, rbcL, matK and rps4, and mitochondrial coxl and atp1 genes.|$|E
500|$|A long-time {{member of}} Miletich Fighting Systems, Hughes left the Miletich camp in late 2007 to start Team Hughes. In 2008, Hughes {{published}} his autobiography, Made in America, {{which made the}} New York Times bestseller list. In 2011, Hughes became host of Outdoor Channel's Trophy Hunters TV. Hughes has no nickname; although because of his success against Gracie jiu-jitsu practitioners such as Royce Gracie, Renzo Gracie, Ricardo Almeida, and Matt Serra, people often refer to him as [...] "the Gracie Killer" [...] (same as Sakuraba's nickname). His mastery of submissions, and having submission wins over various black belt holders <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why Joe Rogan thinks he deserved to get a black belt for BJJ. However Hughes never liked the idea, and considers himself primarily an amateur and submission wrestler.|$|E

500|$|The {{attorneys}} then {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court which denied the initial petition, but later reconsidered and accepted the appeal. The Supreme Court limited their review to the question, [...] "was the charge of contempt, as and when certified, one which the accusing judge was authorized under Rule 42(a) to determine and punish himself; or was it one to be adjudged and punished under Rule 42(b) only by a judge other than the accusing one and after notice, hearing, and opportunity to defend?". The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Robert Jackson, upheld the contempt sentences by a 5–3 vote. Jackson's opinion stated that [...] "summary punishment always, and rightly, is regarded with disfavor, and, if imposed in passion or pettiness, brings discredit to a court as certainly as the conduct it penalizes. But the very practical reasons which have led every system of law to vest a contempt power in one who presides over judicial proceedings also <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> which account for it being made summary." ...|$|E

Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That was what I {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained. [...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely.

500|$|Skate skiing was {{introduced}} to competition in the 20th Century. At the first German ski championship, held at the Feldberg in the Black Forest in 1900, the Norwegian Bjarne Nilssen won the 23km cross-country race and was observed using a skating motion while skiing—a technique unknown to the spectators. Johan Grøttumsbråten used the skating technique at the 1931 World Championship in Oberhof, {{one of the earliest}} recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing. This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. Finnish skier Pauli Siitonen developed a variant of the style for marathon or other endurance events in the 1970s by leaving one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski (one-sided skating); this became known as the [...] "marathon skate". Bill Koch (USA) further developed the marathon skate technique in the late 1970s. Skate-skiing became widespread during the 1980s after Koch's success with it in the 1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships drew more attention to the technique. Norwegian skier, Ove Aunli, started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style. Skating is most effective on wide, smooth, groomed trails, using fiberglass skis that glide well; it also benefits a stronger athlete—which, according to Olav Bø, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> that the technique made a breakthrough in the early 1980s. Athletes widely adopted skating to both sides {{by the time of the}} 1985 world championship and it was formally adopted by the FIS in 1986—despite initial opposition from Norway, the Soviet Union and Finland—while preserving events using only classic technique.|$|E
