5|$|During each of {{the above}} {{mentioned}} attacks on the firebases and relief column, communist forces suffered horrendous casualties from aircraft and <b>armed</b> <b>helicopter</b> attacks, artillery bombardment, and small arms fire. In each instance, however, they were pressed home with a professional competence and determination that both impressed and shocked those that observed them. According to the official PAVN history, by March the North Vietnamese had managed to amass three infantry divisions (2nd, 304th, 308th), the 64th Regiment of the 320th Division and two independent infantry regiments (27th and 28th), eight regiments of artillery, three engineer regiments, three tank battalions, six anti-aircraft battalions, and eight sapper battalions – approximately 35,000 troops, in the battle area.|$|E

This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated <b>armed</b> <b>helicopter.</b> However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{development}} of the AH-56, all <b>armed</b> <b>helicopters</b> had been modifications to existing aircraft designed for unarmed uses. In 1962, then U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara convened the Howze Board to review Army aviation requirements.

2500|$|Although one of {{the first}} armies to {{experiment}} with helicopters, the United States Army was slow to fully explore the possibilities of <b>armed</b> <b>helicopter</b> gunships. Experiments between the Korean War and US involvement in South East Asia were small and fairly simple. Learning much from their experience of these conflicts, the US decided to look further into the idea of air mobile tactics, and subsequently armed helicopters, though an <b>armed</b> <b>helicopter</b> had been proposed and rejected in the early 1940s. By the time the UTTHCO (Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter Company) was deployed to Vietnam in 1962, the US had started experimenting more with the idea of arming helicopters both for defensive and offensive purposes. [...] UTTHCO was an expeditionary unit, deployed to Vietnam to assist the South Vietnamese Army and to provide on the ground testing for new air mobile theory. Weapon systems used by UTTHCO were often crude and made from parts and weapons readily available in the field.|$|E

2500|$|The Invincible {{class has}} {{its origins in}} a sketch design for a 6,000ton, guided-missile <b>armed,</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{carrying}} escort cruiser intended as a complement to the much larger CVA-01-class fleet aircraft carrier. The cancellation of CVA-01 in 1966 meant that the smaller cruiser would now have to provide the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) taskforce with command and control facilities. Two new designs were prepared for this requirement; a 12,500 ton cruiser with missiles forward, six Westland Sea King helicopters and a flight deck aft, somewhat similar to [...] of the Italian Navy and a larger 17,500 ton vessel with a [...] "through-deck", nine Sea Kings and missiles right forward.
