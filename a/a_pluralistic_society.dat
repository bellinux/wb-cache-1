25|$|The {{pressures}} of indigenization {{and the growing}} acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a “false” identity rooted in ethnic nationalism {{as opposed to an}} “authentic” Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by bentuhua, and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation. In the past decade these complaints have subsided somewhat as Taiwan increasingly views itself as <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society</b> that embraces many cultures and recognizes the rights of all citizens.|$|E
25|$|Feyerabend {{described}} {{science as}} being essentially anarchistic, obsessed {{with its own}} mythology, and as making claims to truth well beyond its actual capacity. He was especially indignant about the condescending attitudes of many scientists towards alternative traditions. For example, he thought that negative opinions about astrology and the effectivity of rain dances were not justified by scientific research, and dismissed the predominantly negative attitudes of scientists towards such phenomena as elitist or racist. In his opinion, science has become a repressing ideology, even though it arguably started as a liberating movement. Feyerabend thought that <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society</b> should be protected from being influenced too much by science, {{just as it is}} protected from other ideologies.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on {{religious}} toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English Puritans during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, Catholicism, non-Christian religions, and even atheism. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the General Baptists and the Levellers. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society</b> governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was {{in sharp contrast to the}} ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.|$|E

Perhaps 80 percent of Afghans oppose the Taliban.

2500|$|However, {{even though}} {{mathematics}}, or studies in logic {{were part of}} the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. [...] "The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths" [...] – key word being [...] "divine". İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam." [...] Hence, madaris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society,</b> it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe [...] "Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah." [...] Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach [...] "proper religious values." [...] This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools {{in the sense that they}} offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.|$|E
