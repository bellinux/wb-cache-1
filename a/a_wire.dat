5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI to wear <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> {{to avoid being}} charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E

5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E

Massino also reported that Vincent Basciano, arrested in November, had conspired to kill prosecutor Greg Andres, but after failing a polygraph test regarding the discussion he agreed to wear <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> when meeting the acting boss in jail.

Bond returns to the game just as Leiter loses his last hand to Le Chiffre. The tournament culminates in a $115-million hand in which the remaining players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, go all in. Le Chiffre trumps the other players, but Bond wins with a straight flush.|$|E

The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> service report.|$|E
5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> and the duration of an electric spark.

Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
