40|$|Contralateral {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are together with {{the risk of developing}} osteoarthritis of the knee and the risk of re-rupture/graft failure important aspects to consider after <b>an</b> ACL <b>injury.</b> The aim of this review was to perform a critical analysis of the literature on the risk factors associated with <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury.</b> <b>A</b> better understanding of these risk factors will help in the treatment of patients with unilateral ACL injuries and in the development of interventions designed to prevent contralateral ACL <b>injuries.</b> <b>A</b> Medline search was conducted to find studies investigating risk factors for <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury,</b> as well as studies where <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury</b> was the outcome of the study. Twenty studies describing the risk of a contralateral ACL rupture, or specific risk factors for <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury,</b> were found and systematically reviewed. In 13 of these studies, patients were followed prospectively after <b>a</b> unilateral ACL <b>injury.</b> The evidence presented in the literature shows that the risk of sustaining <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury</b> is greater than the risk of sustaining a first time ACL <b>injury.</b> Return to <b>a</b> high activity level after <b>a</b> unilateral ACL <b>injury</b> was the most important risk factor of sustaining <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury.</b> There was inconclusive evidence of the relevance of factors such as female gender, family history of ACL <b>injuries,</b> and <b>a</b> narrow intercondylar notch, as risk factors for <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury.</b> Risk factors acquired secondary to the ACL injury, such as altered biomechanics and altered neuromuscular function, affecting both the injured and the contralateral leg, most likely, further increase the risk of <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury.</b> This literature review indicates that the increased risk of sustaining <b>a</b> contralateral ACL <b>injury</b> should be contemplated, when considering the return to a high level of activity after <b>an</b> ACL <b>injury...</b>|$|R

40|$|QuestionsDo {{patients}} with <b>a</b> severe ankle <b>injury</b> (baseline ankle function score ≤ 40) do {{worse in the}} short-term than {{patients with}} <b>a</b> mild <b>injury</b> (score > 40) ? Does physiotherapy intervention have more effect on patients with <b>a</b> severe <b>injury</b> compared with <b>a</b> mild <b>injury</b> in the short- or long-term? Is self-reported recovery related to ankle function score over time?DesignSubgroup analysis of a randomised trial. Participants 102 adults with an acute lateral ankle sprain. InterventionThe experimental group received physiotherapist-supervised exercises in addition to conventional intervention. Outcome measuresOutcomes were self-reported recovery, pain, and instability all measured on a 10 -point visual analogue scale, and incidence of re-sprain. Measurements were collected at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks, 3 and 12 months. ResultsParticipants with <b>a</b> severe <b>injury</b> did worse in 3 out of 7 outcomes than those with <b>a</b> mild <b>injury</b> at 4 weeks but not at 8 weeks. There {{was no difference in}} effect of physiotherapy intervention in those with <b>a</b> severe <b>injury</b> compared with <b>a</b> mild <b>injury,</b> at 8 weeks or 12 months. However, there was an effect of physiotherapy intervention in those with <b>a</b> severe <b>injury</b> in 3 out of 7 outcomes at 8 weeks. Self-reported recovery was related to ankle function score at all points in time (r = 0. 48 to 0. 79). ConclusionThe results of this study only partially support the recommendations regarding the use of the ankle function score in the ‘Acute Ankle Injury’ guideline of the Royal Dutch Society of Physiotherapists...|$|R
