5000|$|The {{practice}} of condemnation was transplanted into the American colonies {{with the common}} law. In the early years, unimproved land could be taken without compensation; this practice was accepted because land was so abundant {{that it could be}} cheaply replaced. When it came time to draft the United States Constitution, differing views on eminent domain were voiced. Thomas Jefferson favored eliminating all remnants of feudalism, and pushed for <b>allodial</b> <b>ownership.</b> James Madison, who wrote the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, had a more moderate view, and struck a compromise that sought to at least protect property rights somewhat by explicitly mandating compensation and using the term [...] "public use" [...] rather than [...] "public purpose," [...] "public interest", or [...] "public benefit".|$|E
5000|$|Writing in American Scientific Affiliation, Dennis L. Feucht {{reviewed}} American Militias: Rebellion, Racism & Religion by Richard Abanes, {{and described}} the theory of Richard McDonald, a sovereign-citizen leader, which {{is that there are}} two classes of citizens in America: the [...] "original citizens of the states" [...] (or [...] "States citizens") and [...] "U.S. citizens". McDonald asserts that U.S. citizens or [...] "Fourteenth Amendment" [...] citizens have civil rights, legislated to give the freed black slaves after the Civil War rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their de jure common-law state citizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a Social Security number, driver's license, car registration, use of ZIP codes, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen land owner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or allodial property rights. Such <b>allodial</b> <b>ownership</b> is held [...] "without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof" [...] (Black's Law Dictionary). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.|$|E
50|$|His son and {{successor}} Adam Anton Siegfried {{established a}} fideicommiss or entailment in 1739 (the {{year of his}} death), including the Turjak lordship, the holding of Nadlischegg in Mokronog and the Turjak (or Auersperg) Palace in Ljubljana. He was succeeded by eldest son Adolf Engelbert Ignaz, who died in 1768. On 20 May 1769, the <b>allodial</b> land <b>ownership</b> passed to his widow Elisabeth (nee Lichtenberg), while the fideicommiss went to his brother-in-law Josef Maria.|$|R
50|$|Sons of Jan of Vrbno and Bruntál (Bernard, Hynek, and Mikuláš) {{managed to}} secure an <b>allodial</b> title (<b>ownership)</b> {{to the town}} {{together}} with neighbouring villages and mines from the Dukes of Krnov in 1506. These Lords of Vrbno and Bruntál were steadily stripping the town of its privileges and forced local inhabitants into corvée labour and religious conversion to Lutheranism. These encroachments upon town privileges and the liberties of its citizens resulted in an unsuccessful rebellion against Jan the Elder of Vrbno and Bruntál (Johann der Ältere von Würben und Freudenthal) in 1556.|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a narrative of}} Revolutionary Kentucky, focused on three key areas. First, it traces the struggle Native Americans, white settlers and speculators, and the various colonial, state, imperial, and national governments that claimed the territory for control and possession of Kentucky’s lands {{in the late eighteenth}} century. Second, this study focuses on the long-term effects of the struggle over Kentucky’s lands, paying particular attention to Virginia’s land laws of 1778 - 79, which created the framework by which the state distributed Kentucky’s land, and based on poor implementation of Jeffersonian notions of republicanism and <b>allodial</b> land <b>ownership.</b> Third, this study examines. The region 2 ̆ 7 s transition from an Indian hunting ground to an agricultural economy radically changed the ecology; seeing the elimination of Kentucky’s bison as an archetype of the broader environmental changes taking place. This study argues, in short, that the conflict over the use and ownership of Kentucky lands dramatically impacted Native Americans, Euro-Americans, the future course of western settlement, and the ecology of the region itself...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Allodial</b> title {{constitutes}} <b>ownership</b> of {{real property}} (land, buildings and fixtures) that {{is independent of}} any superior landlord. Allodial title {{is related to the}} concept of land held [...] "in allodium", or land ownership by occupancy and defense of the land. Historically, much of land was uninhabited and could therefore be held [...] "in allodium". Although the word [...] "allodial" [...] has been used in the context of private ownership in a few states of the United States this ownership is still, in much practice, restricted by governmental authority; the word [...] "allodial" [...] in these cases describes land with fewer but still significant governmental restrictions.|$|R
