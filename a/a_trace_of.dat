5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, and there is <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. <b>A</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> her companion.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

Carnivores in general are poor converters of dietary ionone-containing carotenoids.
