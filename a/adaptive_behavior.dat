25|$|ABA-based {{techniques}} have demonstrated effectiveness in several controlled studies: {{children have been}} shown to make sustained gains in academic performance, <b>adaptive</b> <b>behavior,</b> and language, with outcomes significantly better than control groups. A 2009 review of educational interventions for children, whose mean age was six years or less at intake, found that the higher-quality studies all assessed ABA, that ABA is well-established and no other educational treatment is considered probably efficacious, and that intensive ABA treatment, carried out by trained therapists, is demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children. These gains maybe complicated by initial IQ. A 2008 evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches found that ABA is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD. A 2009 comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), a form of ABA treatment, found that EIBI produces strong effects, suggesting that it can be effective for some children with autism; it also found that the large effects might be an artifact of comparison groups with treatments that have yet to be empirically validated, and that no comparisons between EIBI and other widely recognized treatment programs have been published. A 2009 systematic review came to the same principal conclusion that EIBI is effective for some but not all children, with wide variability in response to treatment; it also suggested that any gains are likely to be greatest {{in the first year of}} intervention. A 2009 meta-analysis concluded that EIBI has a large effect on full-scale intelligence and a moderate effect on <b>adaptive</b> <b>behavior.</b> However, a 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis found that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and <b>adaptive</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E

The sustainable building assessment tools measure the user satisfaction dependent to environmental and economic aspects of energy efficient building practices. However, these tools have not yet measure energy efficiency index by involving user satisfaction from <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> dependently, which can determine the actual energy consumption versus the planed energy consumption of the building. Hence, this research aimed at providing a comprehensive list of <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> for assessing energy efficient building indoor environment in design phase of building lifecycle. The study focused on identifying and establishing <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> that are in response to indoor conditions provided by Cooling and Lighting systems in energy efficient office buildings. This research involves adaptations across Technological and Personal. The research was conducted in two phases. Phase one identified the list of user satisfaction <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> through a systematic approach. Next, an expert input {{study was conducted to}} validate the findings of the literature review. Expert input data was collected using Delphi structured close group discussion method, and then analyzed through Grounded Group Decision Making (GGDM) method. Eight experts were involved in four sessions of the GGDM application procedure. The research established 18 <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> relevant to cooling system in energy efficient indoor environments, and 18 <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> relevant to the lighting system. The comprehensive list of user satisfaction <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> can be applied in both current and future sustainable building assessment tools energy efficiency indexes.

Method: Thirty children aged 5 - 14 years diagnosed with ASD+ADHD (n = 13) or ADHD (n = 17) were evaluated on their sensory processing and motor skills and <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Analysis of covariance compared the groups on these dimensions. Correlation analyses examined the association between sensory processing and motor skills and <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results: Compared to children with ADHD alone, children with ASD+ADHD had poorer skills in sensory processing (p < 0. 001), motor (p = 0. 001) and <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> (p < 0. 001). For all children, increased autonomy in self-care was correlated with better sensory processing (p < 0. 001) and motor skills (p = 0. 002).

25|$|Multisensory integration, {{also known}} as {{multimodal}} integration, {{is the study of}} how information from the different sensory modalities, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, self-motion and taste, may be integrated by the nervous system. A coherent representation of objects combining modalities enables us to have meaningful perceptual experiences. Indeed, multisensory integration is central to <b>adaptive</b> <b>behavior</b> because it allows us to perceive a world of coherent perceptual entities. Multisensory integration also deals with how different sensory modalities interact with one another and alter each other's processing.|$|E

This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{on social}} {{identity}} and similarity/attraction theories {{as well as}} empirical studies in intercultural communication, hypotheses were developed to test the effects of three degrees of <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> during intercultural buyer/seller negotiations.

These hypotheses were tested in two experimental studies using scenario-based manipulations. The first study looked at American subjects' responses to <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> of “Japanese business people”. To test the generalizability of these findings to a less familiar culture, a replication looking at American subjects' responses to <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> of “Korean business people” was also conducted.

25|$|A 2009 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving {{a total of}} 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews. Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD {{in the areas of}} cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and <b>adaptive</b> <b>behavior.</b> In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI. Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI. Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site randomized trials are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism. Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder.|$|E

It was shown that subjected to a train of periodic pulses, the circuit learns and anticipates the next pulse similar to the behavior of slime molds Physarum polycephalum where the viscosity of channels in the cytoplasm responds to periodic environment changes. Applications of such circuits may include, e.g., pattern recognition. The DARPA SyNAPSE project funded HP Labs, {{in collaboration with the}} Boston University Neuromorphics Lab, has been developing neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memristive systems. In 2010, Versace and Chandler described the MoNETA (Modular Neural Exploring Traveling Agent) model. MoNETA is the first large-scale neural network model to implement whole-brain circuits to power a virtual and robotic agent using memristive hardware. Application of the memristor crossbar structure in the construction of an analog soft computing system was demonstrated by Merrikh-Bayat and Shouraki. In 2011 they showed how memristor crossbars can be combined with fuzzy logic to create an analog memristive neuro-fuzzy computing system with fuzzy input and output terminals. Learning is based on the creation of fuzzy relations inspired from Hebbian learning rule.|$|E

The proposed classification approach is based on the characteristic frequency signatures of data from leg observers, which combine current sensing with a dynamic model of the leg motion.

ASF provides a clear separation between the implementation of <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> and the server application business logic. This means a server application can be cost effectively extended with programmable adaptive features through the definition and implementation of control components defined in ASF. Furthermore, ASF is a lightweight architecture in that it incurs low CPU overhead and memory usage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ASF through a case study, in which a server application dynamically determines the resolution and quality to scale an image based on the load of the server and network connection speed. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the performance gains possible by <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> and the low overhead introduced by ASF...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Because of the {{importance}} of <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> in social and domestic lives, this study aimed at a comparison of various domains of <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors,</b> between mentally retarded and normal individuals. Methods: A number of 246 normal and 74 mentally retarded in-dividuals (7 - 18 years of age, mean: 12 ± 3. 5 years), participated this study in Tehran, Iran. Their <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors</b> scores, were ob-tained using "Adaptive Behavioral Scale, Residential & Commu-nity" (ABS-RC: 2), consisting of 18 domains of behavior. The scale was first translated into Persian by the professionals and then re-translated into English by another translator, to ensure content non-distortion. Results: The following domains were significantly lower in men-tally retarded than in normal individuals: independent function-ing, economic activity, language development, number & time, prevocational/vocational activity, self direction, responsibility, socialization, disturbing interpersonal behavior, domestic activity, social engagement, conformity and trustworthiness. No significant difference was documented in the physical development, stereo-type & hyperactive behaviors, sexual behavior as well as self abuse behavior domains, between the two groups. Conclusions: As mentally deficient subjects did worse than nor-mal ones in terms of many adaptive behavioral domains, it implies that the adaptive behavioral issues in such people might need {{a great deal of attention}} and intervention. For these retarded people to function better in their social and residential environment, it would be necessary to develop their <b>adaptive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> This study may shed light on {{the importance}} of attention to the adap-tive behavioral domains of mentally retarded people and also indi-cates the necessity of preventive measures, even for normal indi-viduals...|$|R
