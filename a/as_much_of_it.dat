5|$|Keeping {{his promise}} to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone {{appointed}} him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking {{a position in the}} California State Assembly. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{is popular}} with {{pleasure}} boaters, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is pleasantly rural, with added interest {{provided by the}} city of Chester and Ellesmere Port with its waterways museum. The towpath through Chester provides an attractive route for walkers. The canal is well connected, with links to the Trent and Mersey Canal via the Middlewich Branch to the east, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal via the former Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to the south, and provides a route to the Llangollen Canal, from which the Montgomeryshire Canal, which is the subject of an ongoing restoration scheme, can be accessed. Boaters can also access the River Dee at Chester, although advance notice must be given, and the river is only accessible for four hours either side of high tide. At Ellesmere Port, the canal has connected to the Manchester Ship Canal since its opening in 1894. For many leisure cruisers, the requirements of the ship canal company for taking small boats onto a large commercial waterway are too daunting, and Ellesmere Port acts as the end of their journey.|$|E
25|$|While Decolonising the Mind is {{in large}} part a {{reiteration}} of much Ngũgĩ's previous work on the topic, several critics commented that the book finally concentrates his work on language and imperialism, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had previously existed fragmentarily {{in the form of}} lectures, interviews, and scattered articles.|$|E

25|$|The US Forest Service first {{purchased}} land in {{this area}} in 1913 for Shenandoah National Forest, the precursor {{to the present day}} George Washington National Forest. The Forest Service has managed the Ramsey’s Draft area essentially as a wilderness since 1935 <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had never been logged. A road more than three miles (5km) upstream from U.S. 250 constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s lasted until 1969, when rainwater from Hurricane Camille wiped out much of the road at the stream crossings. Another flood in November 1985 further eliminated the original road and changed the course of the stream in multiple areas, shortly after the area was officially designated a wilderness under the Virginia Wilderness Act of 1984.|$|E
25|$|As a humanist public school, Westminster {{maintained}} a curriculum which trained pupils {{in the art}} of rhetoric and the presentation of arguments for both sides of a given issue. This is a skill which would remain with Dryden and influence his later writing and thinking, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> displays these dialectical patterns. The Westminster curriculum included weekly translation assignments which developed Dryden's capacity for assimilation. This was also to be exhibited in his later works. His years at Westminster were not uneventful, and his first published poem, an elegy with a strong royalist feel on the death of his schoolmate Henry, Lord Hastings from smallpox, alludes to the execution of King Charles I, which took place on 30 January 1649, very near the school where Dr. Busby had first prayed for the King and then locked in his schoolboys to prevent their attending the spectacle.|$|E
25|$|Hiroi {{wanted to}} create a version of the Taishō period where the social {{advances}} and freedoms Japanese people began exploring continued without being brought to an end by the Great Kantō earthquake and the subsequent shift to militarism. Another reason for using the Taishō period was the lack of concrete documentation about the period and Tokyo's development during that period, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had been destroyed during the Great Kantō earthquake. Hiroi originally wanted to distinguish the Sakura Wars Taisho from the historical Taisho by modifying the kanji slightly, but he did not do this due to staff wishes for a world that blended real and fictional events. To further distinguish it, Hiroi made use of steampunk technology in the game's world. Despite it being a fantastic version of the Taisho period, Hiroi did his best to incorporate realistic elements, creating a blend of fantasy and reality within the game. The world's general setting, while conceived by Hiroi, was further developed and fleshed out by Kaneko and Morita.|$|E

500|$|The Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival, {{established}} in 1997, {{is held in}} Riverside Park on the fourth Saturday (and the Friday evening before) of July. Beginning in 2008, the Brewers Guild set a goal to operate its beer festivals as [...] "zero-waste" [...] events. They work closely with local recycling and composting companies, such as Recycle Ann Arbor, to manage the removal of any plastic, aluminum, paper, and food waste to ensure that <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as possible is recycled, composted, or used as animal feed. This has been achieved by requiring vendors to biodegradable plates and flatware. Also, unlike many such events, the festival is self-supporting without any outside sponsors.|$|E

500|$|The {{central part}} of the castle {{comprised}} a two-storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the latter to hold part of the bibliophile Marquess's vast library. Both included elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy. The decoration here is less impressive than elsewhere in the castle, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was completed after Burges's death by Lonsdale, a less talented painter. The Arab Room in the Herbert Tower remains however one of Burges's masterpieces. [...] Its jelly mould ceiling in a Moorish style is particularly notable. [...] It was this room on which Burges was working when he died and Bute placed Burges's initials, and his own, and the date 1881 in the fireplace as a memorial. [...] The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase, recorded in a watercolour perspective prepared by Axel Haig.|$|E
500|$|Like its predecessor, Experimental Jet Set was {{produced}} by the band and alternative rock veteran Butch Vig. According to the band, [...] "The idea this time was to cut <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> live as we could, and not labor over polishing and overdubbing in the usual big-rock manner." [...] Similarly, guitarist Lee Ranaldo explained that the band wanted to achieve a more lo-fi approach: [...] "None of [...] music was labored, {{some of it was}} done in people's bedrooms, even. [...] to write the songs and record them simply and basically." [...] Additionally, the band ordered Vig to refrain from his desire to apply a buzz remover to several tracks. The album was engineered by John Siket and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1987 album Sister was recorded. The band claimed that the album was recorded over the master tapes of Sister to save costs, and it is possible to hear some parts of Sister during quiet sections of the final recording. The album was recorded on a two-inch 16-track analog tape recorder through antiquated equipment.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is often {{interpreted}} {{to be dealing with}} issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E
