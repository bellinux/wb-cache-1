50|$|Auditing as a {{tool for}} {{effective}} governance has been recognized and practiced since the Spanish colonial era. One proof of this was the residencia, an inquiry into the administration of an outgoing Governor General and consequently of other officials. Conducted by the Royal Audiencia, it was designed to hold colonial officials to strict accountability for all acts during their term of office. Another was the visita de tierra, a visit of inspection made every three years, which often revealed glaring anomalies in the handling of local government accounts.Colonial officials also performed investigations akin to audit at the time. One was a fraud audit of sorts for galleon trade conducted in the early 1700s. Another, which involved the inspection of the Misericordia de Manila in 1751, had shades of financial audit.In 1739, a Royal Decree by the King of Spain established the royal exchequer which was the national treasury of that era. All books of accounts of the Spanish colonial government were required to pass through the scrutiny and certification of the contador or the accountant and that of the oidor, a representative of the Spanish crown, who by the nature of his duties may be considered as the precursor of the auditor.By mid-19th century, the Tribunal de Cuentas was created. It functioned as the supreme auditing institution of the islands {{until the end of the}} Spanish rule in 1898. Staffed by a president, two auditors, a fiscal, accountants and examiners, the Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction over the audit of all financial matters affecting the colony. These personnel, all appointees of the King, were required by law to review all vouchers and to cross-check them against corresponding entries in the books of accounts. The Birth of an InstitutionNurturing a nascent government requires a mixture of boldness and prudence. And at a time when the early Philippine government was being zealously fleshed out by its American rulers emboldened by their newfound power, then President William McKinley ensured a healthy dose of prudence in these activities.An unnumbered memorandum signed on May 8, 1899 by McKinley gave birth to the Office of the Auditor for the Philippine Islands.By 1900, the Office had become a fixture of government. The civil government was formally ushered in 1901 under William Howard Taft. The major change in the nature of government had ripple effects in the structure of government. One result of such change was the conversion of the Office of the Auditor of the Philippine Islands to the Bureau of the Insular Auditor.However, it was more than a mere change of name. A provincial audit division was created for the Bureau. Moreover, double-entry bookkeeping was introduced which accounted for fuller analysis of settlements and ensured a higher degree of correctness.In 1905, a change of guard took place. Taft resigned as Civil Governor and was replaced by Luke E. Wright who led as Governor General. Under his administration, Act No. 1402 was passed whereby the Bureau of the Insular Auditor was renamed the Bureau of Audits. Growth and Changes: Becoming A Stronger InstitutionAs the nation celebrated its independence with the promulgation of the 1935 Constitution, the institution also reached a milestone. The 1935 Constitution expressly provided for a General Auditing Office, thereby elevating the audit institution to a constitutional body. Renamed as the General Auditing Office or GAO, it now embarked on a full Filipinization of the institution as a reflection of the government-wide transition to self-governance. For the first time, the institution was headed by a Filipino Auditor General in the person of the Hon. Jaime Hernandez.As a major stride towards the independence of the audit institution, the GAO was explicitly placed under the direction and control of an Auditor General to separate it as an organization from the Executive and other departments of the government.In 1972, the country was placed under Martial Law. Government experienced a major upheaval, and the GAO was not exempted. The GAO was renamed the Commission on Audit (COA) and was granted broader powers under the new Constitution promulgated in 1973. Under this Constitution, COA was given a broader area of <b>audit</b> <b>coverage</b> by including the accounts of all subdivisions, agencies, instrumentalities of government and government-owned-and-controlled corporations among those to be examined, audited and settled.As opposed to having an Auditor General single-handedly leading the GAO, the new Constitution provided for a three-man collegial Commission on Audit. This change aimed to strengthen the independence of the auditing office and improve the quality of its decisions, given the rationale that a three-man body was less susceptible to pressure than an office held by a single person. It worked as a built-in internal check within the Commission and encouraged opposing views to surface thereby resulting in earnest consultation and better deliberation.In the years that ensued, the Commission was a hub of activity. A landmark legislation on auditing, Presidential Decree 1445 or the Government Auditing Code, was promulgated in 1978. A Standard Government Chart of Accounts was likewise issued which greatly facilitated financial audit for computerization purposes. The Commission also implemented its comprehensive audit program focusing on the 3Es: economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Installation of this program represented a break from tradition that laid undue emphasis on compliance and voucher audit. And on top of all these, the Commission embarked on a massive reorganization and professionalization of its personnel.This era will also be remembered for the significant involvement of COA in international events such as initiating the establishment of the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI), on to sponsorships of trainings for Asia’s auditors and culminating with the hosting of the XI International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions (INCOSAI) in 1983. It was also during this time that a COA Chairman was first elected to the United Nations Board of Auditors.Years later, the world witnessed the 1986 EDSA Revolution. It was truly a historical event that highlighted the need for reforms in government as a whole. It provided everyone a chance for introspection and created an avenue towards change. As fate would have it, the COA again found itself working under a new government, under a new Constitution and with an even broader scope of authority.The 1987 Constitution maintained the independence of the Commission on Audit as the supreme auditing arm of the Philippine government. Moreover, the Constitution reiterated COA’s role as the sole official external auditor of government agencies as well as government-owned- and-controlled corporations (GOCCs). In other words, the previous practice of some GOCCs and other government agencies of hiring private accounting firms as a requirement of foreign funding institutions to act as their auditors for foreign-assisted projects was no longer allowed.Change, it seems, is the inescapable destiny of the Commission. But as history proves, whatever the nature of change brought about by national political events, the Commission manages to make it for the better.|$|E

Aims: To increase consumer protection by bringing to the attention of regulatory authorities, physicians and the general public the potential dangers of the indiscriminate use first-generation H 1 -antihistamines purchased over-the counter in the absence of appropriate medical supervision. Methods: A GA 2 LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network) task force assessed the unwanted side-effects and potential dangers of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines by reviewing the literature (Medline and Embase) and performing a media <b>audit</b> of US <b>coverage</b> from 1996 to 2008 of accidents and fatal adverse events in which these drugs were implicated. Results: First-generation H 1 -antihistamines, all of which are sedating, are generally regarded as safe by laypersons and healthcare professionals because of their long-standing use. However, they reduce rapid eye movement (REM) -sleep, impair learning and reduce work efficiency. They are implicated in civil aviation, motor vehicle and boating accidents, deaths as a result of accidental or intentional overdosing in infants and young children and suicide in teenagers and adults. Some exhibit cardiotoxicity in overdose. Conclusions: This review raises the issue of better consumer protection by recommending that older first-generation H 1 -antihistamines should no longer be available over-the-counter as prescription- free drugs for self-medication of allergic and other diseases now that newer second- generation nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines with superior risk/benefit ratios are widely available at competitive prices...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - In view of {{the fact}} that claim payouts account for about 70 per cent of annual direct costs in {{non-life}} insurance companies and that claims-handling staff sums up to 10 - 20 per cent of all employees, an optimal claims management environment is of strategic importance. The purpose of this paper is twofold, i. e. on the one hand, the authors introduce a standardized claims management process model and, on the other hand, they apply process benchmarks to various operational parameters. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed claims management process landscape comprises current industry standards for claims handling from a theoretical perspective, supported by practice insights from the industry. Our model aims to reflect the most important claims processing activities. The claims-handling work flow is structured into five core steps, namely, notification, registration, <b>coverage</b> <b>audit,</b> settlement and closing of the claim. For these core steps, the authors differentiate between three claim complexity categories and their associated back-office levels. In the second part of the paper, the authors assess the industry's claims-handling efficiency. The authors benchmark industry processes with reference to detailed claims management data from 11 insurers in Germany and Switzerland. Findings - The benchmarks are based on the previously defined claims management model and are applied separately to the three retail business lines of car, property and liability insurance. We measure claim process times (cycle times) as well as claim quantities and average claim payouts at different levels. Overall, within each business line, more than 30 data points are gathered from each respondent insurer. This allows us to compare the process performance of different insurance companies and to describe significant differences in their process patterns. Furthermore, principal findings are derived from descriptive statistics as well as ad hoc data analyses. Originality/value - The paper seeks to contribute to the discussion of how different insurance companies perform in claims management and to define best practice. Our findings are relevant to academics and practitioners alike...|$|R

Most organisations have computerized their operating systems and for auditors to effectively carry out their audits, {{it is essential that}} they incorporate Information Technology during their audit process. The research meant to identify the changes that Information Technology has brought in auditing. It has been earned out to evaluate the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) in local authorities and in particular Bulawayo City Council (BCC). The research has been carried out to measure the improvements on the audit work in terms of coverage and quality of the audit reports since the use of CAATs by BCC internal audit section. It seeks to make comparisons between manual auditing and the use of CAATs. Theoretical and empirical literature review has been discussed outlining the use and application of CAATs acknowledging the works of other various authors on this subject matter. Information was gathered from both primary and secondary sources to give the researcher an understanding of the benefits brought by Information Technology compared to the traditional manner of carrying out audits. The findings highlighted {{that there has been a}} change in the manner in which auditors execute their duties due to use of CAATs.

External auditors now believe that internal auditors stand in a unique position to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. As a result, IAF’s are now seen as a value adding component of an organisation. Therefore, it was surprising when questionnaire findings revealed that even though there has been more co-operation between both parties in recent years, the nature of internal audit’s work which has actually been helpful to the external auditor and which they have relied upon has been limited. Internal auditors were more positive about the extent of co-operation between both parties and the reliance placed on them when certain qualities are present within the IAF. The results of the primary research also revealed that external auditors consider the objectivity, independence and the quality of the work performed by the IAF as the most important factors affecting the reliance decision. The quality of the work performed by the IAF is actually ranked as the most important factor i. e. the IAF must produce high quality work for external auditors to place reliance on them. External auditors highlighted the interrelationships between these three factors and stated that they would be unwilling to rely on the work of the IAF if any of the above aforementioned qualities were absent...|$|E
40|$|Organisations are {{constantly}} striving to maximise shareholder wealth by improving effectiveness {{and efficiency of}} operations. There has been an emerging trend since the early 1980 ‟s to outsource functions which were considered non-core. These trends have now moved into the internal audit sphere, a function which was previously maintained in-house. With the outsourcing of Internal Audit Functions issues such as independence and the value adding approach of internal audit are brought into question. This paper explores {{similarities and differences between}} public sector internal auditing and its counterpart in the private sector in South Africa. Using survey data collected from a purposive mix of 72 organisations in the South African private and public sector, the degree of internal audit outsourcing, the rationales behind their outsourcing decisions, the types of internal audit services providers, the perceived status of in-house and the perception of Independence of outsourced Internal Audit Functions were investigated. Results from statistical analysis suggest that {{there was no significant difference}} in the consideration of outsourcing of Internal Audit Function by sector. The private sector was significantly more likely to consider internal audit a core activity when compared to the public sector while the public sector were more uncertain. No significant differences were observed between sectors with regards to interaction with external auditors in terms of coordination of areas of <b>audit</b> <b>coverage</b> and work schedule. Private companies were significantly more likely to have longer hours provided by interval service providers relative to outside providers when compared to the public sector. The biggest difference appears to be that private companies chose a big 4 accounting firm more often than in the government sector. Conversely the government sector had a higher frequency of choosing smaller accounting firms and specialised internal audit providers when compared to the private sector. The value of this research study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by means of bridging the gap between the theory and practice from a developing economy xvi and emerging market perspective, by highlighting the different perspectives of Internal Audit practice. Challenges that face this developing economy that are of particular interest when considering the sourcing arrangements of the Internal Audit Function, are events (political, social and economical) that have occurred in South Africa during the past 15 years. The public sector element is unique to other studies that were undertaken in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|MM - P&DMThe Civil Service {{inefficiency}} in {{the last}} two to three decades prompted governments and international development partners to put more emphasis on the reforms in an effort to improve accountability and transparency. Despite these efforts the civil service continue to be shrouded with practices that defy accountability and transparency and total disregard of economic and efficient use of public resources; and therefore ineffective in service delivery. The argument presented contends that the political and administrative deficiencies or shortfalls inherent within government have resulted in poor financial and administrative management of public resources. These have destroyed the professional and social fiber of political leaders and public officials to the extent that pubic demands are sidelined to pursue interests of certain individuals who hold positions of power. In the process management of programmes and the financial management are inefficient weakening accountability and transparency. Weak accountability and transparency mechanisms have been manifested in reports of inefficiency, corruption, waste and misuse of public resources and poor service delivery as reflected in AG’s reports, the media and parliamentary debates. There are also gaps in the auditing of annual accounts the Parliament and the Executive turned a blind eye on this, indicative of lack of commitment towards accountability and transparency. The research has revealed the following as challenges for effecting accountability and transparency mechanisms: Information flow on the activities of the executive from the ministries to Parliament is inadequate, inaccurate and not submitted on time. The information system within the ministries is weak as there is missing information and some not properly recorded making information necessary for accountability and transparency inadequate. This was a result of non-compliance with the financial rules and regulations and these {{compounded by the fact that}} the work was not properly supervised and well monitored. Noncompliance was also aggravated by the fact that the authorities gave directives for incurring certain expenditures which were in conflict with the stipulated rules and iii regulations and therefore weakening the system of information recording. Financial management system has loopholes which hinder information recording for transparency to be achieved. There were also weak internal controls which went unabated resulting in inadequate information on the use of public funds. Inherent skill deficit aggravated inefficiency hence weak accountability and transparency. OAG responsible for ensuring that Parliament gets information receives poor quality information due to inaccessibility and unavailability of some information making the information insufficient and inaccurate. This coupled with shortfalls within the office such as lack of independence impedes the office from obtaining the quality of staff and lacks other resources such as equipment and vehicles which are necessary for carrying out its mandate efficiently. <b>Audit</b> <b>coverage</b> is therefore about 20...|$|E
40|$|Australia’s system compares poorly with {{compliance}} {{measures in the}} United States, argues Nilay PatelEXPOSURE of medical service providers’ unsatisfactory billing practices, has been gaining strong momentum. These practices take multitudinous forms: billing for services not provided; providing medically unnecessary services; upcoding; unbundling; and double billing. These practices are not unique to Australia. They are widespread and more complex in the United States and are monumentally taxing on their public purse, estimated at $ 60 billion per year compared to an estimated $ 2 billion per year in Australia. There are also other less well-known practices such as provider-patient collusion and sophisticated kickback schemes by and between different types of providers. What is unique to Australia however, is the poor compliance framework within which the providers operate and seek reimbursement. The oversight agencies such as Medicare Australia appear more consumed with detection, typically through audits – the coverage of which has increased this year from 0. 7 per cent to 4 per cent of the total provider population. While detection is unarguably important, less overt attention is directed towards prevention. But even the increase in <b>audit</b> <b>coverage</b> appears anomalous because the law remains ambiguous as to the rights and responsibilities of Medicare Australia and providers in relation to gaining access to the information necessary to perform audits (although in most instances providers are cooperative). Further, Medicare Australia’s 2008 – 09 National Compliance Program, which details their approach, is a mere 28 -page booklet of which over a quarter is devoted to full-page photographs and other items of non-substance. While the booklet makes much of the measures Medicare Australia will take to detect fraud, {{there is no mention}} and no imposition of measures to prevent it. In the United States, there is a virtual requirement for all types of medical providers (doctors, hospitals, hospices, laboratories, teaching institutions, long-term care facilities and others) seeking reimbursement, or those who are bulk-funded by the government, to develop their own effective compliance programs. Unlike Australia, the US government provides detailed guidelines specifically applicable to each provider type. All healthcare compliance programs in the United States, regardless of the provider type, must share seven sacrosanct elements. They: (1) call for the development and distribution of written policies and procedures and standards of conduct; (2) appoint a compliance officer and a compliance committee; (3) develop an appropriate education program; (4) provide for internal monitoring and auditing; (5) build internal structures to enable reporting and investigation of concerns or allegations; (6) provide for enforcement and discipline; and (7) have a system to respond to detected offences and must allow for corrective plans or initiatives. Australian Standard 3806, first introduced in 1998 and last revised in 2006, largely reflect these elements. It is one of over 7000 Australian Standards created by Standards Australia, the peak non-government standards body, with the input of some 8000 technical, business government and other experts. AS 3806 assists both public and private sector organisations in developing and implementing effective compliance programmes and is of cardinal relevance to those who operate under a legislative or regulatory framework. It has also become a benchmark for Australian regulators when assessing an organisation’s compliance programme. It is doubtful whether providers have adopted AS 3806 if they even know of its existence. In any case, it is inappropriate for governmental health agencies to rely, if they do, on AS 3806 because it is so broad that it applies to virtually any industry. The health sector is inherently and uniquely complex and would require a significantly higher level of tailored guidance. Further, it is alarming that the Australian Standards, even though they have no statutory recognition unless enshrined into statute, are available only for purchase, especially given that the Australian courts, as do the United States courts through their Federal Sentencing Guidelines, view compliance programs as having a mitigating effect on penalties and sentences. For those providers resolved to resorting to improper practices, no compliance program will matter and only significant penalties or prosecution will be the appropriate response. The difficulty is in separating inadvertence from intent. The consequence of these provider practices {{is not limited to the}} perpetrator’s unjust enrichment. It affects every Australian. Not only is waste, fraud and abuse unlawful or otherwise unethical and takes critical resources out of our health care system, it contributes to the rising cost of health care for all Australians and harms the short-term and long-term solvency of essential governmental health programs. It is time for Australia’s federal and state governments to respond with the imposition of vigorous measures, not only on themselves but more importantly, on the providers. Specialist enforcement personnel or agencies need to be enhanced, evidence-gathering powers need to be clarified and strengthened and penalties are in need of review with a number of those convicted of fraud receiving light penalties.       Nilay B.
