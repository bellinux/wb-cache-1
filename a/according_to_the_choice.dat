Something perhaps were to be wished in thy capacity of attention and memory, not incompatible even with the feminine mind.

And though--since I agree with the divine Petrarca, when he declares, quoting the `Aulularia' of Plautus, who again was indebted for the truth to the supreme Greek intellect, `Optimam foeminam nullam esse, alia licet alia pejor sit'--I cannot boast that thou art entirely lifted out of that lower category to which Nature assigned thee, nor even that in erudition thou art {{on a par with}} the more learned women of this age; thou art, nevertheless--yes, Romola mia," [...] said the old man, his pedantry again melting into tenderness, [...] "thou art my sweet daughter, and thy voice is as the lower notes of the flute, `dulcis, durabilis, clara, pura, secans aera et auribus sedens,' <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> words of Quintilian; and Bernardo tells me thou art fair, and thy hair is like the brightness of the morning, and indeed it seems to me that I discern some radiance from thee.

60|$|By the Feudal Law, all landed {{property}} is, by a feigned conclusion, {{supposed to be}} derived, and therefore to be mediately or immediately held, from the crown. If some estates were so derived, others were certainly procured by the same original title of conquest by which the crown itself was acquired, and the derivation from the king could in reason only {{be considered as a}} fiction of law. But its consequent rights being once supposed, many real charges and burdens grew from a fiction made only for the preservation of subordination; and in consequence of this, a great power was exercised over the persons and estates of the tenants. The fines on the succession to an estate, called in the feudal language reliefs, were not fixed to any certainty, and were therefore frequently made so excessive that they might rather be considered as redemptions or new purchases than acknowledgments of superiority and tenure. With respect to that most important article of marriage, there was, in {{the very nature of the}} feudal holding, a great restraint laid upon it. It was of importance to the lord that the person who received the feud should be submissive to him; he had, therefore, a right to interfere in the marriage of the heiress who inherited the feud. This right was carried further than the necessity required: the male heir himself was obliged to marry <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of his lord; and even widows, who had made one sacrifice to the feudal tyranny, were neither suffered to continue in the widowed state nor to choose for themselves the partners of their second bed. In fact, marriage was publicly set up to sale. The ancient records of the Exchequer afford many instances where some women purchased by heavy fines the privilege of a single life, some the free choice of an husband, others the liberty of rejecting some person particularly disagreeable. And what may appear extraordinary, there are not wanting examples where a woman has fined in a considerable sum, that she might not be compelled to marry a certain man; the suitor, on the other hand, has outbid her, and solely by offering more for the marriage than the heiress could to prevent it, he carried his point directly and avowedly against her inclinations. Now, as the king claimed no right over his immediate tenants that they did not exercise in the same or in a more oppressive manner over their vassals, it is hard to conceive a more general and cruel grievance than this shameful market, which so universally outraged the most sacred relations among mankind. But the tyranny over women was not over with the marriage. As the king seized into his hands the estate of every deceased tenant in order to secure his relief, the widow was driven often by an heavy composition to purchase the admission to her dower, into which it should seem she could not enter without the king's consent.|$|E

6000|$|The common law, as it then {{prevailed in}} England, {{was in a}} great measure {{composed}} of some remnants of the old Saxon customs, joined to the feudal institutions brought in at the Norman conquest. And it is here to be observed, that the constitutions of Magna Charta {{are by no means}} a renewal of the laws of St. Edward, or the ancient Saxon laws, as our historians and law-writers generally, though very groundlessly, assert. They bear no resemblance, in any particular, to the laws of St. Edward, or to any other collection of these ancient institutions. Indeed, how should they? The object of Magna Charta is the correction of the feudal policy, which was first introduced, at least in any regular form, at the Conquest, and did not subsist before it. It may be further observed, that in the preamble to the Great Charter it is stipulated, that the barons shall HOLD the liberties, there granted TO THEM AND THEIR HEIRS, from THE KING AND HIS HEIRS; which shows, that the doctrine of an unalienable tenure was always uppermost in their minds. Their idea even of liberty was not (if I may use the expression) perfectly free; and they did not claim to possess their privileges upon any natural principle or independent bottom, but, just as they held their lands, from the king. This is worthy of observation. By the feudal law all landed property is, by a feigned conclusion, supposed to be derived, and therefore to be mediately or immediately held, from the Crown. If some estates were so derived, others were certainly procured by the same original title of conquest, by which the crown itself was acquired; and the derivation from the king could in reason only be considered as a fiction of law. But its consequent rights being once supposed, many real charges and burthens grew from a fiction made only for the preservation of subordination; and in consequence of this, a great power was exercised over the persons and estates of the tenants.

5000|$|Lattice delay {{networks}} {{are an important}} subgroup of lattice networks. They are all-pass filters, {{so they have a}} flat amplitude response, but a phase response which varies linearly (or almost linearly) with frequency. All lattice circuits, regardless of their complexity, are based on the schematic shown below, which contains two series impedances, Za, and two shunt impedances, Zb. Although there is duplication of impedances in this arrangement, it offers great flexibility to the circuit designer so that, in addition to its use as delay network (as featured here) it can be configured to be a phase corrector, [...] a dispersive network, an amplitude equalizer, or a low pass (or bandpass) filter, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of components for the lattice elements [...] It is shown in Lattice networks that when a lattice is configured as a delay network, it has a characteristic impedance which is resistive (= Ro), its impedances Za and Zb are dual impedances, i.e. Za&middot;Zb = Ro2 [...] (or Za/Ro = Ro/Zb) and Za and Zb consist of inductors and capacitors. Such a lattice is a constant resistance network and an all-pass filter, and it has a phase response determined by the properties of Za. This makes it ideal as a delay device because it can be included in a cascade of other filter sections without affecting the overall amplitude response, nor will it create mismatch problems, but it will increase the phase slope (i.e. the delay) of the overall assembly.|$|E

After this, it was still not until the Companies Act 1856, the Trade Union Act 1871 and the Criminal Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 that companies and then trade unions became generally lawful. In Germany, a similar set of repressive laws were put in place against both trade unions and social democrat organisations by the Bismarck government under the Sozialistengesetze (the [...] "Socialist Acts") in 1878. These remained in force until 1890. In 1933, trade unions were once again prohibited by the Fascist dictatorship of Hitler's National Socialist party, and the existing unions were nationalized and combined into a single government controlled German Labor Front. After World War II, free trade unions were quickly resurrected and guaranteed by the German Grundgesetz. In the United States, trade unions were classified by various state courts, at various times, as being in restraint of trade. Under the Clayton Act of 1914, trade unions were given a general freedom to organize and to act collectively to secure collective agreements, however further hurdles were put in place until the National Labor Relations Act 1935 created a comprehensive labor code.|$|E
