5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> {{to the idea of}} psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also led him to the formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> to {{renewable}} energy, ranking {{as one of}} the top 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E

30|$|European elites have an {{intellectual}} and emotional {{commitment to the}} idea of “Europe” that is not necessarily mirrored in their national citizenries. Data gathered by the IntUne Project suggests that “Eurelitism” is “characterized by <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> attachment to Europe, <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> support for the process of European integration, and <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> willingness to transfer substantial elements of national sovereignty to the European level than is found in the general population” [9]. This data also indicates that older elites have <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>commitment</b> to European integration than do younger ones [9].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between voluntary participation in environmental organisations and the justifiability of littering behaviour. Previous empirical work regarding determinants of littering and littering behaviour remains scarce, particularly in socio-economic analysis. We address these deficiencies, demonstrating <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> empirical link between environmental participation and reduced public littering in the European Values Survey (EVS) data for 30 Western and Eastern European countries. The results suggest that membership in environmental organisations is related to <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>commitment</b> to anti-littering behaviour, thereby supporting improved environmental quality...|$|R

Using data from the 2004 General Social Survey, we compare {{public servants}} in government and outside government {{to the general public}} through a series of logistic regression models. Although there is little difference in terms of denominational affiliation, public servants have <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>commitment</b> to, and are more active in, their religious communi-ties.

25|$|France {{guarantees}} {{freedom of}} religion as a constitutional right, and the government generally respects this right in practice. A long history of violent conflict between groups led the state to break its ties to the established Catholic Church early in the last century, which previously had been the state religion. The government adopted <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> to maintaining a totally secular public sector.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the Neo-Gaullists, the Giscardian UDF {{advocated}} less economic interventionism by the state, the decentralisation in aid of {{the local}} authorities, and <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> towards {{the building of a}} federal Europe. According to the historian René Rémond, the UDF descended from the Orleanist tradition of the right, whereas the RPR was a reincarnation of the Bonapartist tradition, which promotes national independence by virtue of a strong state.|$|E
