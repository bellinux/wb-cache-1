5|$|There {{is also a}} {{correlation}} between location of Stylidium species and proximity of known carnivorous species, like sundews (Drosera), bladderworts (Utricularia), the Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and the rainbow plant (Byblis). While this <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> prove that Stylidium species are themselves carnivorous, the hypothesis is that the association arose because Stylidium species and the known carnivorous plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary proof is given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases.

While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E

5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates.

HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E

25|$|Coin {{certification}} {{has greatly}} {{reduced the number}} of counterfeits and grossly overgraded coins, and improved buyer confidence. Certification services can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. The numeric grade <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as toning, strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel money away from purchasing additional coins.|$|E
25|$|No {{satisfactory}} explanation can as yet {{be given}} for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> determine {{the proportion of the}} two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though {{it is not possible to}} formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.|$|E
25|$|Sleep is {{regulated}} by two parallel mechanisms, homeostatic regulation and circadian regulation, {{controlled by the}} hypothalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), respectively. Although {{the exact nature of}} sleep drive is unknown, homeostatic pressure builds up during wakefulness and this continues until the person goes to sleep. Adenosine is thought to {{play a critical role in}} this and many people have proposed that the pressure build-up is partially due to adenosine accumulation. However, some researchers have shown that accumulation <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explain this phenomenon completely. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle in the body, which has been shown to continue even in the absence of environmental cues. This is caused by projections from the SCN to the brain stem.|$|E

25|$|Cancer {{can be seen}} as a {{disturbance}} in the homeostatic balance between cell growth and cell death. Over-expression of anti-apoptotic genes, and under-expression of pro-apoptotic genes, can result in the lack of cell death that is characteristic of cancer. An example can be seen in lymphomas. The over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> cause cancer. But simultaneous over-expression of Bcl-2 and the proto-oncogene myc may produce aggressive B-cell malignancies including lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a chromosomal translocation commonly occurs between the fourteenth and the eighteenth chromosomes — t(14;18) — which places the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This fusion gene is deregulated, leading to the transcription of excessively high levels of Bcl-2. This decreases the propensity of these cells for apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{and being}} {{underweight}} {{are more common}} in the elderly than in adults of other ages. If elderly people are healthy and active, the aging process <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> usually cause malnutrition. However, changes in body composition, organ functions, adequate energy intake and ability to eat or access food are associated with aging, and may contribute to malnutrition. Sadness or depression can play a role, causing changes in appetite, digestion, energy level, weight, and well-being. A study on the relationship between malnutrition and other conditions in the elderly found that malnutrition in the elderly can result from gastrointestinal and endocrine system disorders, loss of taste and smell, decreased appetite and inadequate dietary intake. Poor dental health, ill-fitting dentures, or chewing and swallowing problems can make eating difficult. As a result of these factors, malnutrition is seen to develop more easily in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice <b>alone</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E
