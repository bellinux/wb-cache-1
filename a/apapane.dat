50|$|An adult <b>apapane</b> is small, with {{a length}} of 13 cm when fully grown. Male <b>apapane</b> have a mass 16 g, while females average 14.4 g. The {{slightly}} curved bluish black bill measures 15 - 17 mm. There is a distinct gender difference in size. The major traits of an adult <b>apapane</b> are a bright crimson top and back; white bottom and under tail; with black wings and legs. A unique characteristic of the <b>apapane</b> is the white undertail coverts which can be seen clearly when the tail is cocked. The white under tail is a distinctive feature that separates the <b>apapane</b> from the other similar native birds. Juvenile <b>apapane</b> are pink when hatched and are covered in patches of dull brownish feathers. The brown color changes to crimson at maturity. Along with crimson, it can be white, black and gray with small black eyes with a brown outline. The back of its wings and its tail are colored black, while back bottom is a grayish-white.|$|E
50|$|The <b>apapane</b> (Himatione sanguinea) is {{a species}} of Hawaiian {{honeycreeper}} that is endemic to Hawaii. The bright crimson feathers of the <b>apapane</b> were once used to adorn the ahuula (capes), mahiole (helmets), and nā lei hulu (feather leis) of alii (Hawaiian nobility). <b>Apapane</b> form small flocks when foraging through the canopies of ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees, drinking nectar from the flowers and simultaneously pollinating them. They never forage on the forest floor. When flowering of ōhia is low and if {{not part of a}} flock, <b>apapane</b> will be chased away from flowers by more aggressive competing birds such as the ʻakohekohe and iiwi.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>apapane</b> can {{be found}} on six of the eight {{windward}} Hawaiian islands, where it resides at high altitudes to protect itself from predators like small Asian mongooses, rats, and deadly avian malaria carrying mosquitoes. These predators are the cause of great declines in the <b>apapane</b> population. The total population of the <b>apapane</b> was estimated at more than 1,300,000 in 1995. Although still low in numbers, the <b>apapane</b> is not considered to be an endangered species. The species has the highest prevalence of avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum). This is because seasonal migrations to lower elevation forest put it in contact with mosquitoes, which are absent from the best <b>apapane</b> habitat. [...] Malaria is a blood parasite, and death is usually cause by anemia, the loss of red blood cells. [...] Fowlpox (Poxvirus avium) is a virus lethal to <b>apapane,</b> which, like avian malaria, is transmitted by mosquitoes. Fowlpox causes wart-like lesions to form around the bird's eyes, beak, legs, or feet, inhibiting feeding, seeing, or perching. [...] Birds infected with fowlpox are more at risk to be infected with malaria. It is believed that at least {{a small portion of the}} population is becoming resistant to malaria, as some pairs have been seen breeding in mid-elevation forests where the rate of malaria transmission is high.|$|E

50|$|The bird is {{considered}} to be an active singer. The males are known for their singing patterns at all times of the day. They have six different calls and about ten different recorded song patterns. The contact call or song of a male <b>apapane</b> is mainly used for mate attraction and breeding. The male who is most aggressive and sings the loudest is the one who wins the females' attention. Once courtship and pair formation has been established, and copulation is complete, both male and female <b>apapane</b> are involved in the nesting process. The male role is important for maintaining courtship feeding during the nest construction and incubation period. The male <b>apapane</b> sings continuously during incubation, while the female does not sing at all. His loud whistling, and chirping sound chases other male birds away from the nesting tree, while he sits on an adjacent perch guarding the nest. The <b>apapane</b> has two distinct flight patterns: straight flight and a circling flight.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010 <b>Apapane</b> {{was voted}} Champion two-year-old filly in the JRA Awards for 2009.|$|E

50|$|After {{a summer}} break, <b>Apapane</b> {{returned}} in autumn {{with the third}} leg of the triple crown, the Shuka Sho as her objective. She prepared for the race with a run in the Grade II Rose Stakes over 1800 metres at Hanshin in September. Racing {{for the first time}} in almost four months she finished fourth of the twelve runners behind Animate Bio, Wild Raspberry and A Shin Returns. On 17 October <b>Apapane</b> faced seventeen rivals including Saint Emilion, Animate Bio, Wild Raspberry, A Shin Returns, Shoryu Moon, and Oken Sakura in the Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. She completed the Triple Crown, beating Animate Bio by three quarters of a length. On her final run of the season <b>Apapane</b> was matched against older fillies and mares in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup over 2200 metres at Kyoto on 14 November. She started the 1.7/1 favourite but was beaten into third place by the British filly Snow Fairy.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Conservation== Today {{there are}} no direct actions being taken {{concerning}} this species, however anything that {{is being done to}} help rarer species of birds throughout Hawaii will also help the <b>apapane.</b> The removal of ungulates, including goats, cattle, and pigs, prevents habitat degradation. Furthermore, pigs create wallows, which are important breeding ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Extermination of rats, which prey on eggs, and cats, which are able to catch adults, has been beneficial to the <b>apapane.</b> Some of its habitat, including the parts under federal jurisdiction, are highly managed and devoid of invasive ungulates due to fencing strategies employed by resource managers. Unattended areas, however, are often highly degraded and have many of the pre-management ungulates that help to create habitat for predators and mosquitoes.|$|E
50|$|On May 23, 2010, in the 71st {{running of}} the Yushun Himba, <b>Apapane</b> and Saint Emilion hit the finish {{at the same time}} in the race, making the first time that a Grade 1 race in Japan has {{resulted}} in a dead heat for the win.|$|E
50|$|The {{akohekohe}} is a nectarivore {{that feeds}} on the flowers of ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) {{high up in}} the canopy. It is an aggressive bird and will drive away competing nectarivores, such as the related <b>apapane</b> and iiwi. When ōhia lehua blossoms are limited, it will eat insects, fruit, and nectar from other plants. The akohekohe will forage in the understory if necessary, where food plants include ākala (Rubus hawaiensis).|$|E
5000|$|Elaborate feather cloaks called ʻahuʻula {{were created}} by early Hawaiians for the alii (royalty). [...] Feathers were also used in women's skirts called pāū. The iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and <b>apapane</b> (Himatione sanguinea), which {{provided}} red feathers, were killed and skinned due to their abundance. Yellow feathers {{were obtained from the}} mostly black and rarer ōō (Moho nobilis) and mamo (Drepanis pacifica) using a catch and release philosophy to ensure future availability.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Apapane</b> {{are found}} in mesic and wet forests {{dominated}} by ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) and koa (Acacia koa) trees. The best habitat also contains kōlea lau nui ( [...] Myrsine lessertiana), naio (Myoporum sandwicense), and hapuu (Cibotium spp.) tree ferns, while māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) is a common species in high elevation foraging habitat. [...] Most <b>apapane</b> are found at an elevation above 4100 ft, keeping the birds away from mosquitoes. It lives on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Lānai, Kauai, Molokai and Oahu. Most of these birds survive on Hawaii where about 86% or 1,080,000 thrive in the higher ōhia forests, especially in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The next largest population is found on Maui; it {{is made up of}} 110,000 individuals, most of them found in protected forests on the slopes of Haleakalā. Molokai is home to a healthy population of 39,000 birds. On Kauai, there is a population of about 30,000 apapane; most survive in the protected reserves such as the Alakai Wilderness Preserve. Small relict populations of about 500 birds exist on Oahu and Lānai.|$|E
50|$|Her sire, King Kamehameha {{was one of}} {{the best}} Japanese colts of his generation, beating a field {{including}} Heart's Cry and Daiwa Major in the 2004 Japanese Derby. His other winners as a breeding stallion include Lord Kanaloa, Rose Kingdom, Belshazzar (Japan Cup Dirt) and Rulership (Queen Elizabeth II Cup). King Kamehameha was named after a Hawaiian monarch: his daughter <b>Apapane</b> was named after a native Hawaiian bird whose feathers were once used to decorate the capes of the island's nobility.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Apapane</b> {{remained}} in {{training as a}} five-year-old but failed to reproduce her best form and failed to win in three races. She finished seventh in the Grade II Hanshin Himba Stakes, fifth in her attempt to repeat her 2012 success in the Victoria Mile and sixteenth in the Yasuda Kinen. She was being prepared for an autumn campaign {{when she began to}} suffer from lameness owing to what was described as [...] "superficial digital flexor tendonitis". She was retired from racing to become a broodmare.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is from January through July. The nest of the <b>apapane</b> is usually {{placed in the}} crown of a ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha); nests {{have been found in}} tree cavities and lava tubes {{as well as in the}} top of koa (Acacia koa), kāwau (Ilex anomala) and hapuu (Cibotium tree ferns). The extinct Laysan honeycreeper nested in dense grass bunches and āheahea (Chenopodium sandwichensis) shrubs. Only female <b>apapane</b> incubate. After hatching, both male and female feed the young and care for them until they are ready to fly out on their own time. The female has approximately two to four eggs (white with red markings) a year. Incubation lasts 13 to 14 days and during this time the female does not sing at all. When the chicks are born the eyes are closed and it will take four days for them to open. After the sixth day blotches of brown feathers begin to appear on the back and the mouth lining is pink. After this the chicks are very multicolored. They will be gold, pink, red, green, and black. They will be weaned in a month, but can stay up to four months or a year with the parents.|$|E
50|$|After {{the summer}} break <b>Apapane</b> {{returned}} in the Grade II Fuchu Himba Stakes at Tokyo in October {{in which she}} started favourite but finished unplaced behind Italian Red. In November she replicated her 2010 performance in the Queen Eliabeth II Commemorative Cup as she finished third to Snow Fairy. On her final run of the year she was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Mile on 11 December. After racing prominently {{in the early stages}} she faded in the straight and finished thirteenth of the fourteen runners behind Able One.|$|E
50|$|Lord Kanaloa is a {{bay horse}} with no white {{markings}} bred in Hokkaido, Japan by the K I Farm.

50|$|It {{is found}} on the Big Island, Maui, and Molokai in Hawaii. It {{formerly}} occurred on Lānai where it was last seen in 1976. It {{is one of the}} most common honeycreepers, inhabiting all types of habitat on the islands at elevations from sea level to 8000 ft. Of all the forest birds native to Hawaii, the Hawaii amakihi has been affected the least by habitat changes. It is suspected that it is evolving resistance to diseases such as avian malaria. Along with the <b>apapane,</b> it is one of the two Hawaiian honeycreepers listed by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
50|$|The {{expedition}} {{began with}} the goal of exterminating domestic rabbits that had been introduced to Laysan island by the guano industry in 1902. Since that time, the rabbits had devoured Laysan's vegetation and led to the extinction of several endemic species. The rabbits were eventually eliminated on Laysan, and the crew witnessed the extinction of the Laysan honeycreeper (<b>apapane).</b> Throughout the expedition, new species were discovered and named, and unique specimens were captured and returned to laboratories for further study. Over 100 archaeological sites were found, including ancient religious sites and prehistoric settlements on Nihoa and Necker Island.|$|E
50|$|Lovely Day {{is a dark}} bay {{or brown}} horse with a white star bred in Japan by his owner Makoto Kaneko.

His other winners as a breeding stallion include Lord Kanaloa, Rose Kingdom (Japan Cup), Belshazzar (Japan Cup Dirt), Rulership (Queen Elizabeth II Cup) and <b>Apapane.</b> Lovely Day's dam won one race, the Listed Sweetpea Stakes from five starts in 2002 and 2003. The colt was sent into training with Yasutoshi Ikee, previously best known for handling Orfevre.|$|E
50|$|The {{coloring}} {{was achieved}} using {{different types of}} feathers. Black and yellow came from four species of bird called ōōs. All species had become extinct by 1987, with the probable cause being disease. Black feathers were also sourced from the two species of mamo, which are also now both extinct. The distinctive red feathers came from the Iiwi and the <b>Apapane.</b> Both species can still be found in Hawaii, but in much reduced numbers. Although birds were exploited for their feathers, {{the effect on the}} population is thought to be minimal. The birds are said to have not been killed but, rather, caught by specialist bird catchers, a few feathers harvested, and the birds then released.|$|E

50|$|The {{colouring}} {{was achieved}} using {{different types of}} feathers. The black and yellow came from a bird called the Moho or Oo in Hawaiian. There were four varieties of this bird. The last type became extinct in 1987 with the probable cause being disease. Black feathers were also sourced from the bird called the Mamo which is also now extinct. The distinctive red feathers came from Vestiaria coccinea - the Scarlet Hawaiian Honeycreeper or Iiwi and the species Himatione sanguinea {{also known as the}} <b>apapane.</b> Both species are still moderately common birds in Hawaii. Although birds were exploited for their feathers the effect on the population is thought to be minimal. The birds were not killed but were caught by specialist bird catchers, a few feathers harvested and then the birds were released.|$|E
50|$|Kahana State Park {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of birds and fish. Oopu naniha (Stenogobius hawaiiensis), a native freshwater fish, {{can be found in the}} streams of the lower valley. Amaama (flathead mullet, Mugil cephalus) and milkfish (Chanos chanos) are common in the Huilua Fishpond. Bird species that can be found in the lower valley include Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), sanderling (Calidris alba), wandering tattler (Tringa incana), aukuu (black-crowned night heron, Nycticorax nycticorax), alae keokeo (Hawaiian coot, Fulica alai), and alae ula (Hawaiian gallinule, Gallinula chloropus sandvicensis). The last two species are endangered. In the upper valley are many native species of songbirds, such as the <b>apapane</b> (Himatione sanguinea) and Oahu amakihi (Hemignathus flavus), along with non-native species of mynah, cardinal, dove and ricebird.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apapane</b> (Japanese: アパパネ, foaled 20 April 2007) is a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse {{who won the}} Japanese Fillies' Triple Crown in 2010. As {{a two-year-old}} in 2009 she won three of her four races {{including}} the Grade I Hanshin Juvenile Fillies and won the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Filly. In the following year she won the Oka Sho and Yushun Himba before completing the Triple Crown in the Shuka Sho and winning the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly. In the following spring she won her fifth Grade I race when she defeated the Japanese Horse of the Year Buena Vista in the Victoria Mile. She never won again and was retired after developing a leg problem in September 2012. Apart from her victories she finished third in consecutive runnings of the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup.|$|E
50|$|On 23 May the filly was {{stepped up}} in {{distance}} and started favourite {{for the second}} leg of the Triple Crown, the Grade I Yushun Himba over 2400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse. Oken Sakura, A Shin Returns, Shoryu Moon and Animate Bio were again in the field {{as well as the}} Grade II Flora Stakes winner Saint Emilion. On a wet and gloomy day she tracked the leaders before moving to the outside on the final turn. The last 200 metres saw the race develop into a sustained struggle between <b>Apapane</b> and Saint Emilion and with neither filly able to establish an advantage the pair crossed the line together, two lengths clear of the other sixteen runners. After a ten minute delay during which the racecourse judges scrutinised the photo-finish the result was declared as a dead-heat.|$|E
