40|$|Los dispositivos FPGA persisten como componentes fundamentales para el diseño y evaluación de sistemas electrónicos. En el caso de las FPGAs {{basadas en}} memoria SRAM de Xilinx, éstas soportan Reconfigurabilidad Parcial Dinámica (DPR) por medio del Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP). Este componente físico permite acceder a la memoria de configuración mientras el sistema está operando y {{por lo tanto}} la DPR puede ser usada para modificar partes específicas del sistema mientras que el resto sigue funcionando sin ser afectado. La arquitectura del sistema pude ser modificada a nivel de componentes lógicos básicos como Look-Up-Tables (LUTs), o a nivel de bloques más grandes como IPs con lo cual la flexibilidad de los sistemas puede mejorar. Ésta es una gran ventaja especialmente en sistemas críticos, como los aeroespaciales, donde el acceso al sistema para modificar su {{hardware}} no es una tarea sencilla. Pero el principal problema que estas FPGAs presentan cuando son utilizadas para aplicaciones críticas es su susceptibilidad a Single Event Upset (SEU) y Multi-bit Upset (MBU) en la memoria de configuración. Éste es un factor limitante que debe ser considerado para evitar malfuncionamiento del hardware implementado. Esta tesis está enfocada en usar DPR como un mecanismo para: i) mejorar la flexibilidad del hardware, ii) emular fallos de forma precisa en diseños ASIC mapeados en FPGAs y iii) mejorar la tolerancia a fallos acumulados o múltiples en la memoria de configuración de circuitos con Triple Redundancia Modular (TMR). Este trabajo aborda estos aspectos considerando como figura de mérito fundamental la velocidad de ejecución de las tareas. Por lo tanto uno de los principales objetivos es acelerar las tareas relacionadas con DPR. En primer lugar un controlador hardware para el ICAP fue diseñado: AC_ICAP. Éste además de soportar lectura y escritura de frames, manejo de bitstreams parciales desde memoria flash y memoria interna de la FPGA, también permite DPR de alta velocidad a nivel de LUTs sin necesidad de bitstreams parciales previamente generados. Esta última característica es posible gracias a ingeniería inversa en el bitstream con la cual se puede ejecutar DPR de LUTs individuales en menos de 5 μs. Ésto representa una mejora en tiempo de reconfiguración de más de 380 veces comparado con el controlador XPS_HWICAP de Xilinx En segundo lugar, la DPR a nivel de LUTs es utilizada en la emulación de fallos para evaluar circuitos ASIC mapeados en FPGAs. Para ello se diseña un CAD que incluye un traductor de la descripción ASIC a una descripción basada en LUTs para ser implementada en FPGAs, generación de diccionarios de fallos y extracción de patrones de prueba. Una plataforma hardware usa el listado de fallos y aprovecha la DPR de la FPGA para la inyección precisa de fallos seguida de la aplicación de los patrones de test para analizar los efectos de los fallos en el circuito. Finalmente la DPR es utilizada para mejorar la tolerancia a fallos de circuitos TMR implementados en FPGAs basados en memoria SRAM. En estos dispositivos la acumulación de fallos en la memoria de configuración puede generar fallos en las réplicas TMR. Por lo tanto la rápida detección y corrección de fallos sin detener el sistema es un requerimiento que se debe cumplir cuando se usan estas FPGAs en la implementación de sistemas críticos. Para ello se insertan detectores de errores de tipo XNOR que convergen en componentes carry-chain de la FPGA y además cada dominio es aislado en áreas diferentes del dispositivo para los cuales se extraen bitstreams parciales. Éstos son utilizados para corregir los fallos cuando los detectores son activados. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices persist as fundamental components {{in the design and}} evaluation of electronic systems. They are continuously reported as final implementation platforms rather than only prototype elements. The inherent reconfigurable characteristics that FPGAs offer {{are one of the most}} important advantages in the actual hardware implementation and redesign of systems. In the case of Xilinx SRAM-based FPGAs they support Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) by means of the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP). This hardwired element allows the configuration memory to be accessed at run time. DPR can then be used to change specific parts of the system while the rest continues to operate with no affection in its computations. Therefore the architecture of the system can be modified at the level of basic logic components such as Look-Up-Tables (LUTs), or bigger blocks such as IP cores, and in this way more flexible systems can be designed. It is a great advantage especially in critical and aerospace applications where the access to the system to re-design the hardware is not a trivial task. But on the other hand, the main problem these FPGAs present when used for critical applications is their sensitivity to Single Event Upset (SEU) and Multi-bit Upset (MBU) in the configuration memory. It is a limiting factor that must be considered to avoid misbehavior of the implemented hardware. This thesis is focused on using DPR as a mechanism to: i) improve hardware flexibility, ii) emulate faults on ASIC designs mapped in FPGAs and iii) improve tolerance to accumulated or multiple faults in the configuration memory of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) circuits. This work addresses the three challenges considering as one of the most relevant figures of merit the speed at which the tasks can be performed. It is therefore one of the main objectives we consider: the speed-up of DPR related tasks. In the first place we developed a new high speed ICAP controller, named AC_ICAP, completely implemented in hardware. In addition to similar solutions to accelerate the management of partial bitstreams and frames, AC_ICAP also supports DPR of LUTs without requiring pre-computed partial bitstreams. This last characteristic was possible by performing reverse engineering on the bitstream. This allows DPR of single LUTs in Virtex- 5 devices to be performed in less than 5 μs which implies a speed-up of more than 380 x compared to the Xilinx XPS_HWICAP controller. In the second place, the fine grain DPR obtained with the utilization of the AC_ICAP is used in the emulation of faults to test ASIC circuits implemented in FPGAs. It is achieved by designing a CAD flow that includes a custom technology mapping of the ASIC net-list to LUT-level FPGA net-list, the creation of fault dictionaries and the extraction of test patterns. A hardware platform takes the fault list and leverages the partial reconfiguration capabilities of the FPGA for fault injection followed by application of test patterns for fault analysis purposes. Finally, we use DPR to improve the fault tolerance of TMR circuits implemented in SRAM-based FPGAs. In these devices the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> in the configuration memory can cause the TMR replicas to fail. Therefore fast detection and correction of faults without stopping the system is a required constraint when these FPGAs in the implementation of critical systems. This is carried out by inserting flag error detector based on XNOR and carry-chain components, isolating and constraining the three domains to known areas and extracting partial bitstreams for each domain. The latter are used to correct faults when the flags are activated...|$|E

The microstructures are modeled by a grain growth theory, and the mechanical deformation behavior is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation in nc-cobalt samples with an average grain size of 10 nm. The deformation mechanisms are found to involve both full and partial dislocation activities. Despite the small stacking <b>fault</b> energy <b>of</b> nc-cobalt, surprisingly the deformation twinning is not prevalent in the model cobalt sample. The simulation suggests that unlike the easy twinning events in coarse-grained hcp metals, deformation of nanocrystalline cobalt is primarily controlled by partial dislocation slips and stacking <b>faults.</b> The continuous <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> deformation <b>faults</b> eventually leads to hcp to face-centred cubic allotropic phase transformation during tension and compression of nc-cobalt...|$|R

40|$|This map {{presents}} {{a model of}} crustal strain rates derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of horizontal station velocities. The model indicates the spatial distribution of deformation rates within the Pacific –North America plate boundary from the San Andreas fault system {{in the west to}} the Basin and Range province in the east. As these strain rates are derived from data spanning the last two decades, the model reflects a best estimate of present-day deformation. However, because rapid transient effects associated with earthquakes (i. e., postseismic deformation resulting in curvature of the GPS time-series) have been removed from the GPS data, these strain rates can be considered representative of the long-term, steady-state, deformation associated with the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> strain along <b>faults.</b> This model is useful for both seismic-hazard and geodynamic studies to understand the activity rates of (known and unknown) faults and the plate tectonic boundary and buoyancy forces that cause the deformation, respectively.

40|$|Dyke {{intrusions}} {{and normal}} faulting {{play an important}} role during continental break-up but little is known about how the normal faults develop. Direct evidence <b>of</b> dyke-induced <b>faulting</b> is limited by the lengthy repeat times between individual rifting episodes, the small amount of subaerial rift zones and until recently the technical ability to record small surface changes across large areas. The most recent (2005 - 2010) rifting episode at the Dabbahu rift segment, Afar, Ethiopia provided a unique opportunity to study dyke-induced fault growth. The combination of new high-resolution topographic LiDAR data and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data provides information of cumulative as well as incremental fault throw. In this thesis I use high-resolution LiDAR data of the Dabbahu rift segment to reveal a dense network <b>of</b> short <b>fault</b> segments (> 3400) at various stages <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> linkage set in ﬂood basalt plains. I develop and present a semi-automatic algorithm that extracts throw along surface fault traces from the high-resolution LiDAR DEM. The largest amount of throw (80 m) is found on faults towards the east of the rift segment. At the central Ado’Ale volcanic ediﬁce predominant bookshelf faulting is evident which might be an indication of a lateral shift of the dykes towards the east. I use the throw data to derive a strain ﬁeld for the rift. Faults record 140 m of extension, implying extensive resurfacing. I derived displacement data from two LiDAR surveys and InSAR data, for two separate dyke intrusions. Both data sets show that faults are re-activated in a broad, 3 - 4 km wide, asymmetric zone parallel to the dyke induced subsidence with the majority of the new throw being accumulated on 1 - 2 large west-dipping fault structures in the east. The incremental displacement-length, d − L, data presented here is the ﬁrst quantitative study <b>of</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> new <b>fault</b> throw across an entire rift segment. Incremental throw across linkage zones suggest two types <b>of</b> behaviour once <b>fault</b> linkage is complete. 1) Individual fault segments maintain the ability to slip independently. This was previously only observed during analogue modelling. 2) The connected faults act as one throughgoing fault with slip unaffected by the linkage zone. The combination of these two processes might be responsible for the commonly observed small-scale corrugation in d − L data. In contrast to published fault growth models, I present evidence that the remnant <b>fault</b> tip <b>of</b> a linkage zone does not necessarily become inactive once linkage is complete, and that linkage zones do not ‘catch up’ through accelerated throw once linkage is complete...|$|R
40|$|Moment {{accumulation}} rate (also {{referred to}} as moment deficit rate) is a fundamental quantity for evaluating seismic hazard. The conventional approach for evaluatingmoment <b>accumulation</b> rate <b>of</b> creeping <b>faults</b> is to invert for the slip distribution fromgeodeticmeasurements, although even with perfect data these slip-rate inversions are non-unique. In this study, we show that the slip-rate versus depth inversion is not needed because moment accumulation rate can be estimated directly from surface geodetic data. We propose an integral approach that uses dense geodetic observations from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) to constrain the moment accumulation rate.

The <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade I and II were deep, early and large while the <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade III were shallow, late and small.

30|$|Cyclic {{martensitic}} {{transformations in}} iron-based alloys lead to formation of specific structural and phase {{state with a}} complex system of crystalline defects referred to as phase hardening [1]. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry have shown that γ-α-γ (fcc-bcc-fcc) transformations in iron-nickel alloys result {{in an increase in}} dislocation density in reverted austenite more than by three orders of magnitude. Owing to high degree of phase hardening (after tens of repetitive transformations), γ-phase structure incorporates a large number of deformation twins. In case of multiple cyclic martensitic transformations (CMT), additional sub-boundaries are formed in these alloys, provided that generation of new dislocations, their accumulation, and interaction occur during cycling. This leads to the development of highly dispersed misoriented fragments of reverted austenite and triggers the process of phase recrystallization of the initial structure (nanofragmentation) [2, 3]. In contrast to iron-nickel alloys, the dislocation density of the reverted austenite in iron-manganese alloys, where γ-ε-γ (fcc-hcp-fcc) martensitic transformations occur, increases by no more than an order of magnitude [1]. This behavior can be explained when taking into account rather different volume effects of martensitic transformations. The γ-α and the γ-ε transformations are accompanied by the increase in the specific volume of 3 to 4 and of 1.75  %, respectively [4]. This difference causes the development of different numbers of dislocations in the process of the transformations. Again, iron-manganese alloys possess low energy <b>of</b> stacking <b>faults</b> that facilitates <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> chaotic stacking <b>faults</b> (CSF) during multiple CMT. Therefore, in alloys with different types of martensitic transformations, CMT result in formation of different types of crystalline defects.|$|R
30|$|The Putaohua Oilfield is a fault-prolific {{area and}} the faults have close {{relation}} with structural traps. The genetic models of the structural traps in the Putaohua Oilfield {{can be divided into}} two types: individual fault model and multi-fault interaction model. This is based on the description of displacement distribution of typical individual normal <b>faults,</b> the geometry <b>of</b> the footwall and hanging wall, and the analysis of the interaction between faults and the corresponding change in geometry when the faults grow. The individual fault model is that the displacement reaches a maximum at or near the center <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> and decreases toward the fault tips, so a half-graben is formed on the hanging wall <b>of</b> the <b>fault</b> and a half-anticline is formed on the footwall because of the isostatic process. The multi-fault interaction model is that during the growth <b>of</b> <b>faults,</b> they overlap and interact with each other, and accommodation zones are formed in the overlapping segments. The accommodation zones are favorable targets for hydrocarbon exploration, and the trap characteristics are dependent on the extent of overlap and occurrence <b>of</b> <b>faults.</b> The multi-fault interaction model can be subdivided into three types: synthetic accommodation zone, convergent accommodation zone and divergent accommodation zone.

However, existing drilling in the southeastern fault zone indicates a discrepancy: the western section (Liudong area) has inferior exploration findings to the eastern section (Yaxi area). A deep understanding of geological characteristics in these two areas is essential to effective and efficient oil exploration and exploitation.

Our study shows that the mining-cased activation <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> has remarkable fractal interface effect; the mechanical behavior of mining-caused shearing sliding <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> is correlated with its fractal dimension, and after mining-caused activation fault surface with different fractal dimensions will result in different stress fields and different displacement fields in the nearby rock mass...|$|R

First, we zoom the early fault feature signals by using the stochastic resonance theory. Second, we extract the feature vectors <b>of</b> early <b>fault</b> using the multi-resolution analysis of the wavelet packet. Third, we input the feature vectors to a fault classifier, which can be used to identify the early <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> AERS and carry out self-recovery monitoring <b>of</b> <b>fault.</b> In this paper, features <b>of</b> early <b>fault</b> on AERS, the zoom <b>of</b> early <b>fault</b> characteristics, the extraction method <b>of</b> early <b>fault</b> characteristics, the construction of multi-fault classifier and way <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> self-recovery monitoring are studied.

40|$|Detection {{conditions}} of specific classes <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> {{have recently been}} studied by many researchers. Under the assumption that at most one <b>of</b> these <b>faults</b> occurs in the software under test, these fault detection conditions were mainly used in two ways. First, {{they were used to}} develop test case selection strategies for detecting corresponding classes <b>of</b> <b>faults.</b> Second, they were used to study fault class hierarchies, where a test case that detects a particular class <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> can also detect some other classes <b>of</b> <b>faults.</b> In this paper, we study detection conditions <b>of</b> double <b>faults.</b> Besides developing new test case selection strategies and studying new fault class hierarchies, our analysis provides further insights to the effect <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> coupling. Moreover, these fault detection conditions can be used to compare effectiveness of existing test case selection strategies (which were originally developed for the detection of single occurrence of certain classes <b>of</b> <b>faults)</b> in detecting double faults that may be present in the software.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{worked a}} lot on geologic conditions for lateral sealing <b>of</b> <b>faults,</b> but none <b>of</b> their studies took the effect of internal structures <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> zones on the lateral sealing capacity <b>of</b> <b>faults.</b> Therefore, the lateral sealing <b>of</b> active <b>faults</b> has rarely been discussed. In this paper, based on {{the analysis of the}} composition and structure characteristics <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> fillings, the geological conditions for lateral sealing <b>of</b> active <b>faults</b> and relevant research method were discussed in reference to the lateral sealing mechanisms <b>of</b> inactive <b>fault</b> rocks. It is shown that, in order to satisfy geologically the lateral sealing <b>of</b> active <b>faults,</b> the faults should be antithetic and the faulted strata should be mainly composed of mudstone, so that the displacement pressure <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> fillings is higher than or equal to that of reservoir rocks in oil and gas migration block. Then, a research method for the lateral sealing <b>of</b> active <b>faults</b> was established by comparing the displacement pressure of fillings in the <b>fault</b> with that <b>of</b> reservoir rocks in oil and gas migration block. This method was applied to three antithetic faults (F 1, F 2 and F 3) in No. 1 structure of the Nanpu Sag, Bohai Bay Basin. As revealed, the fillings of these three active faults were mostly argillaceous at the stage <b>of</b> natural gas <b>accumulation</b> (the late stage of Neogene Minghuazhen Fm sedimentation), and their displacement pressures were higher than that of reservoir rocks in the first member of Paleogene Dongying Fm (F 1 and F 3) and the Neogene Guantao Fm (F 2). Accordingly, they are laterally sealed for natural gas, which is conducive to the <b>accumulation</b> and preservation <b>of</b> natural gas. Industrial gas flow has been produced from the first member of Paleogene Dongying Fm in Well Np 101, the Guantao Fm in Well Np 1 - 2 and the first member of Paleogene Dongying Fm in Well Np 1, which is in agreement with the analysis result. It is verified that this method is feasible for investigating the lateral sealing <b>of</b> active <b>faults...</b>|$|R

Further the problem is compounded when distance relays are used for protection of double circuit transmission lines due to effects of zero sequence mutual coupling. Different types <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> on protected transmission line should be located correctly. This paper presents wavelet analysis and Wavelet Modulus Maxima techniques for fault distance location for all the ten types <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> (3 LG, 3 LLG, 3 LL, 1 LLL) in both circuits of a double circuit transmission line fed from sources at both the end. This technique uses only end of data and accurate fault distance location is achieved after one cycle from the the inception <b>of</b> <b>fault.</b> The analysis for fast identification <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> is evaluated based on {{the representation of the}} travelling waves through wavelet modulus maxima. The present criterion can detect the instant <b>of</b> <b>fault,</b> location <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> and kind <b>of</b> <b>fault.</b> MATLAB / Simulink software was used to test the proposed approach. Various fault conditions were simulated by varying fault type, fault resistance, fault location and fault inception angle, on a given power system model.
