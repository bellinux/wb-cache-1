40|$|Nine-ending {{price and}} {{consumer}} behavior: An evaluation in a door-to-door buying context - The effect of nine-ending prices on consumer’s behavior was little studied whereas its practice is largely used. Only one experimental research {{showed that it}} did not contribute {{to increase the number of}} purchasers but leads to increase the average basket of the purchaser. After presented a review of research on this topic and its theoretical state, we proposed a new experiment were salesmen, in a door-to-door context, sold pastry makings for the profit of a human organisation. The prices, given verbally, were either with a 9 -ending termination (1. 99 € <b>an</b> <b>half-dozen</b> of crepes) or with a "full" termination (2. 00 € the crepe half-dozen). The results show a positive effect of the " 9 -ending" prices on the rate of purchasers but not on the average basket. These contradictions are discussed according to a contextual approach. ...|$|R
5|$|Kirby's Dream Land {{has since}} spawned dozens of sequels across more than <b>a</b> <b>half-dozen</b> video game consoles. The first direct sequel Kirby's Adventure, {{released}} on the Nintendo Entertainment System, introduced {{the ability to}} steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become {{a staple of the}} series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game Kirby Air Ride, pinball game Kirby's Pinball Land, and even an Action-Golf hybrid game Kirby's Dream Course. Kirby's Dream Land would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1995 Kirby's Dream Land 2, which incorporated the copy mechanic from Kirby's Adventure.|$|E

His involvement with Broadway began with a short-lived 1967 play, The Ninety Day Mistress, in which he partnered with another rookie producer, James Nederlander.

Sixty of them arrived safely at Malta. For the next operation on 17May, the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes of 813 Squadron flew back on board to join the 17 Spitfires and six Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers destined for Malta. The fighters flew off without incident, but engine problems forced all of the Albacores to return. After they had landed, the ship was attacked by <b>a</b> <b>half-dozen</b> SM.79 torpedo bombers which failed to score any hits. The radar-guided guns of the escorting light cruiser, , were instrumental in driving off the determined Italian aircraft.|$|E

Nearby communities in Okanogan County offer horseback riding and hunting. Fishing and boating is achievable within short distance, at the nearby Omak Lake. The Omak Pioneers represent Omak High School as their baseball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball, and wrestling teams. There are separate teams based on age and gender. There are all-terrain vehicle (ATV) courses located nearby, specifically in the Loup Loup Ski Bowl.|$|E

Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images {{or even more}} were shot {{at the rate of}} 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. <b>A</b> <b>half-dozen</b> expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J.

Indelicato could count on the support of at least four Bonanno capos. With each capo {{controlling}} <b>an</b> estimated <b>half-dozen</b> to <b>a</b> dozen other soldiers, Indelicato's faction was a tight-knit, significant force. He was cocky towards Rastelli and disrespectful to capos Joseph Massino and Dominick [...] "Sonny Black" [...] Napolitano, but dismissive toward the Bonanno family's Sicilian faction.|$|R
60|$|The only bad {{effect of}} all this {{was to make the}} lives of Mrs. Schoville and divers others of her sex more monotonous, and to cause them to lose faith in certain hoary and inconsequent maxims. Furthermore, Captain Alexander, as highest official, was a power in the land, and Jacob Welse was the Company, and there was a superstition extant {{concerning}} the unwisdom of being on indifferent terms with the Company.

5|$|Hoping to {{take the}} stronghold by surprise, on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men {{carrying}} concealed weapons. The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. His tactic foiled, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. Pontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from <b>a</b> <b>half-dozen</b> tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28 a British supply column from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee.|$|E
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until {{he lost his job}} in a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of <b>a</b> <b>half-dozen</b> officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Orbetello {{was erected}} in a spit between two inner bays {{of a big}} lagoon. Various {{fortified}} positions made it a strong defensive position: Porto Ercole at the east, San Stefano at the west, and the fort San Filippo on the Monte Argentario island, linked to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. In the end, the French army landed at Talamone, where Brézé left to the Prince <b>a</b> <b>half-dozen</b> of vessels and galleys to bombard the forts of the town. Meanwhile, he went to Porto San Stefano with 5 sailing ships and 4 galleys and bombarded the fort until it surrendered. After the loss of those positions, Don Carlo de la Gatta, the castillan of Orbetello, retreated to the hermitage of Cristo. The isthmus was occupied thanks to a battery mounted aboard the French galleys, and soon the lagoon was filled with armed boats gathered by Jean-Paul de Saumeur, Chevalier Paul. Don Carlo de la Gatta, supported by just 200 Spanish and Italian soldiers, had very few opportunities to resist without help. An early relief force of 35 boats and 5 escort galleys sent from Naples with munitions and supplies was beaten, so a major fleet action was expected.|$|E

For a week, steeling himself to the task, Smoke enforced the exercise and the spruce-tea. And one by one, and in twos and threes, he was compelled to knock off the workers. As he was learning, exercise was the last thing in the world for scurvy patients.

5|$|Amazing was published, {{with some}} interruptions, for almost eighty years, going through <b>a</b> <b>half-dozen</b> owners and many editors as it {{struggled}} to be profitable. Gernsback {{was forced into}} bankruptcy and {{lost control of the}} magazine in 1929, and by 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly {{before the end of the}} pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.|$|E

She was much older than he, a young woman, and he had seen her at a distance only <b>a</b> paltry <b>half-dozen</b> times. But that made no difference.

He is no great scribe, rather handling his pen like the pocket-staff he carries about with him always convenient to his grasp, and discourages correspondence with himself in others as being too artless and direct a way of doing delicate business. Further, he often sees damaging letters produced in evidence and has occasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them.
