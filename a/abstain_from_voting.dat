25|$|The Israeli government's {{decision}} to appeal on Kastner's behalf {{led to its}} collapse, as Prime Minister Moshe Sharett resigned when the General Zionists, {{a member of his}} coalition, refused to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> <b>voting</b> on a no-confidence motion filed by Herut and Maki. Kastner became a hate figure in Israel, and compared the verdict against him to the Dreyfus affair. He resigned his government position and started working for the Israeli Hungarian-language newspaper Új Kelet. He was assassinated in 1957 (see below).|$|E

25|$|Herzl {{acted as}} {{chairperson}} of the Congress which was attended by some 200 participants from seventeen countries, 69 of whom were delegates from various Zionist societies and the remainder were individual invitees. Ten non-Jews were also in attendance and were expected to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> <b>voting.</b> Seventeen women attended the Congress, {{some of them in}} their own capacity, others accompanying representatives. While women participated in the First Zionist Congress, they did not have voting rights; they were accorded full membership rights at the Second Zionist Congress, the following year.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1993 season, Sabatini {{continued}} to advance deep into grand slam singles events. At the Australian Open, she reached the semifinals but lost to the eventual champion, Seles, with a score of 2–6, 1–6. Later that year at Roland Garros, Sabatini was defeated by Fernández in a quarterfinals. Sabatini had raced to a seemingly insurmountable 6–1, 5–1 lead and appeared poised for an easy victory. However, Mary Joe saved five match points on her way to winning a second set tiebreak. Finally, after 3½ hours, Fernández eliminated Sabatini by a final score of 1–6, 7–6 (7–4), 10–8. Despite the setback at the French Open, Sabatini reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, losing to Jana Novotná, a player she had beaten six consecutive times. However, this time Novotná defeated Sabatini in straight sets. At the 1993 US Open, Sabatini had hoped to end the year on a high note, but she would first have to again get past Graf, this time in the quarterfinals. In their four previous meetings, Graf had beaten Sabatini, but Sabatini was looking to change those recent results. After losing the first set at 2–6, Sabatini raised the level of her game in the second set, winning at 7–5 to even the match at one set apiece. However, in the third and deciding set, Graf dismantled Sabatini with a 6–1 final set to win the match. That year, Sabatini was the only player to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> <b>voting</b> against Seles for having her ranking preserved following her stabbing.|$|E

2500|$|At the convention, {{the first}} ballot by elected delegates was preset {{according}} by proportional representation {{according to the}} amount of support each leadership candidate received at the delegate selection meeting (the [...] "leadership portion" [...] of the ballot cast at riding association or club meetings), even if the delegate has personally expressed support for another candidate. Ex officio and undeclared delegates could vote however they wish, while declared delegates were compelled to vote for their declared candidate, their only other choice being to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> <b>voting</b> on the first round. On the second ballot (which occurred because no leadership candidate received over 50% of the vote on the first ballot), all delegates were free to vote according to their personal preference.|$|E
2500|$|Bayard {{also played}} an {{important}} part in the U.S. presidential election of 1800. With the vote tied in the Electoral College, it was a group of Federalists led by Bayard who broke the deadlock by agreeing to allow the election of Thomas Jefferson by the House of Representatives. When it seemed the Federalists were about to vote for Aaron Burr, Bayard is believed to have followed the advice of Alexander Hamilton and persuaded his Federalist colleagues to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> <b>voting.</b> It was also believed he struck a deal with the incoming Jefferson, to refrain from the wholesale removal of Federalists from appointed positions. The young Bayard enlisted Representative Samuel Smith (Maryland) to deal with Jefferson on Federalist control of the Philadelphia and Wilmington custom offices. [...] While that was never proved, Jefferson allowed the Federalist office holders to remain employed.|$|E
60|$|Sir Roger's eloquence {{was of a}} rough kind; but not {{perhaps the}} less {{operative}} on those for whom it was intended. The aristocracy of Barchester consisted chiefly of clerical dignitaries, bishops, deans, prebendaries, and such like: on them and theirs it was not probable that anything said by Sir Roger would have much effect. Those men would either <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> <b>voting,</b> or vote for the railway hero, with the view of keeping out the de Courcy candidate. Then came the shopkeepers, who might also {{be regarded as a}} stiff-necked generation, impervious to electioneering eloquence. They would, generally, support Mr Moffat. But there was an inferior class of voters, ten-pound freeholders, and such like, who, at this period, were somewhat given to have an opinion of their own, and over them it was supposed that Sir Roger did obtain some power by his gift of talking.|$|E

They said it was {{impossible}} for them to [...] vote for the second reading in any case, but before they decided [...] to <b>abstain</b> <b>from</b> <b>voting</b> against it they wished to know how far the [...] government would act in a conciliatory spirit. I made to them the [...] same declaration that I afterwards made in the House, and after [...] seeing you I had another interview with the Archbishop of [...] Canterbury. I told his grace that it was impossible for the [...] government to suggest amendments against themselves, but I gave a [...] hint of the direction in which such amendments might be framed, [...] and, without mentioning that the suggestion came from you, I said [...] that if his grace would tell Dr. Ball that he only wished to [...] propose amendments which it would be possible for the government [...] to accept, that learned gentleman would know better than others [...] how it could be done. The archbishop, however seems chiefly to [...] have made use of Dr. Ball to supply him with arguments against the [...] government.|$|E
