In addition to J. communis, other edible species include Juniperus drupacea, Juniperus phoenicea, Juniperus deppeana, and Juniperus californica.

5|$|In {{the first}} moment after an enzyme is mixed with substrate, no product has been formed and no {{intermediates}} exist. The study of the next few milliseconds of the reaction is called pre-steady-state kinetics.

5|$|In the United States, the {{production}} <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> Mozzarella and pizza cheese steadily {{increased in the}} mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. In the U.S., several hundred million pounds of pizza cheese is consumed annually. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of the product was 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) in the United States and 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons, 220,460,000 pounds) in Europe. It has been estimated that 30% of all pizza cheese used in the United States is Mozzarella cheese. As of 2000, demand for the product was growing in Europe by 8 percent per year.|$|E
5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E

Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Subfamilies exhibit {{different}} feeding strategies. While Bovinae species graze {{extensively on}} fresh grass and diffused forage, Cephalophinae species (with {{the exception of}} Sylvicapra) primarily consume fruits. Reduncinae and Hippotraginae species depend on unstable food sources, but the latter are specially adapted to arid areas. Members of Caprinae, being flexible feeders, forage even in areas with low productivity. Tribes Alcelaphini, Hippotragini, and Reduncini have high proportions of monocots in their diets. On the contrary, Tragelaphini and Neotragini (with the exception of Ourebia) feed extensively on dicots. No conspicuous relationship exists between body size <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> monocots.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} food {{eaten in}} Sihanaka {{has long been}} rice, which they cultivate heavily. The rice based diet was supplemented by {{a wide range of}} game and other meats, including lemurs, wild boars, snakes, owls, rats, cats and crocodile, the latter having at one time been protected by a fady that was eventually abandoned. Use of tobacco or marijuana <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> pork were commonly forbidden in Sihanaka families. Many believed that transporting swine across Lake Alaotra would bring storms. Their traditional dress consisted of clothing woven of raffia fibers.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} a study of dental microwear on tooth enamel for {{specimens}} of the carnivore species from LaBrea pits, including dire wolves, suggest that these carnivores were not food-stressed just before their extinction. The evidence also indicated that the extent of carcass utilization (i.e., amount consumed relative to the maximum amount possible to consume, including breakup <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> bones) was less than among large carnivores today. These finding indicates that tooth breakage was related to hunting behavior {{and the size of}} prey.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental {{region in the}} northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines {{are similar to those}} produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm. Annual production of wine exceeds 140million litres. Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> beer started; the annual consumption of beer in 2008 was 83.3litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E

5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
