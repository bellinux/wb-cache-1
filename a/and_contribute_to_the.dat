5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{rich history}} of {{settlements}} on the bay, including: ancient Native American campgrounds dating back millennia; 19th-century European immigrant towns such as Lamar and Aransas; and the present day cities of Rockport, Fulton and Aransas Pass. Resources such as shrimp, fish, oysters and oil are found {{in or near the}} bay, <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local economies.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} villas remain today <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dozen Grade II listed {{buildings}} in the suburb, which has continued to develop into an affluent area with a village feel. The suburb is wholly contained within the Gateshead council ward {{of the same name}} and is represented locally by members of the Liberal Democrats party, though nationally the suburb is represented by the Labour party as part of the constituency of Gateshead. The suburb is home to several schools and churches. The principal landmark in the suburb is St Helen's Church, although also located in the settlement is Underhill, the home of Sir Joseph Swan and the first domestic property in the world to be illuminated by electric light. England international cricketer Graham Onions is a current resident of the suburb.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{is low and}} narrow, with a long premaxilla and maxilla {{compared}} to those of Tanystropheus. Both the premaxilla and the maxilla meet at the anteroventral (front bottom) corner <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border of the nostril, which {{is located at the}} anterior (front) end of a long recess that extends along the snout in front of the eye socket (the antorbital depression). The bottom margins of the two snout bones are respectively lined with five and twelve long and nail-like teeth; the third premaxillary and fourth and fifth maxillary teeth are distinctly fang-like. The lower jaw has fifteen preserved teeth, with three of them being fang-like. By comparison, the teeth in adult Tanystropheus are sharp pegs, while they are tricuspid (bearing three cusps) in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Aransas Bay, west of Rockport, Texas in Refugio and Aransas counties. It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas Bay, and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, the bay {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous finfish including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the bay. Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around the bay were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the bay as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} Vancouver signed defenceman Jason Garrison to a six-year contract worth $27.6 million. While the Canucks brought in Garrison, they lost longtime defenceman Sami Salo. The Canucks wanted to re-sign Salo, {{though they were}} unwilling to sign him to a two-year contract and offered only a one-year deal. Salo chose to leave and signed a two-year $7.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was believed that Garrison would step in <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power play and replace the departed Salo, who had performed a similar role. However, he struggled to adjust with his new team. He {{was taken off the}} power play unit and dropped to the third pairing within the first month. After the injuries to Bieksa, Garrison was moved from left defenceman to the right side pairing with Dan Hamhuis. The coaching staff came to consider this pairing to be the best and most trusted. Garrison finished the season with eight goals and eight assists, scoring three goals and three assists on the power play, and registering a +18 rating. His plus-minus was second on the team and led all defenceman.|$|E
5|$|Sayers {{was educated}} {{at home and}} then at the University of Oxford. This was unusual for a woman at the time, as they were not {{admitted}} as full members of the university until 1920 – five years after Sayers had completed her first class degree in medieval French. In 1916, a year after her graduation, Sayer published her first book, a collection of poems entitled Op. I, which she followed two years later with a second, a slim volume titled Catholic Tales and Christian Songs. The same year she was invited to edit <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> annual editions of Oxford Poetry, which she did for the next three years. In 1923 she published Whose Body?, a murder mystery novel featuring the fictional Lord Peter Wimsey, and went on to write eleven novels and five collections of short stories about the character. The Wimsey stories were popular, and successful enough for Sayers to leave the advertising agency where she was working.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, three {{distinct}} subspecies have been recognised: the Queensland koala (P.c. adustus, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales koala (P.c.cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala (P.c.victor, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala {{is the smallest}} of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull. The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit. Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation. Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene. Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations. In April 2013, scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome.|$|E
