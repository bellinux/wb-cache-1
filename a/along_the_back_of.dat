5|$|In 2013, {{the council}} {{announced}} that Denmark Street would be redeveloped by the architectural firm ORMS {{as part of}} a major development in conjunction with the Crossrail construction work around Tottenham Court Road tube station and Centre Point. The proposed development includes the construction of an 800-seat subterranean performance venue. Numbers 1–6 and 17–21 Denmark Place, which run parallel <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the street, and the York and Clifton Mansions will be demolished, along with partial demolition of No. 21 Denmark Street.|$|E
5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5000|$|The name, Brachylophus, {{is derived}} from two Greek words: brachys (βραχύς) meaning [...] "short" [...] and lophos (λόφος) meaning [...] "crest" [...] or [...] "plume", {{denoting}} the short spiny crests found <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> these species.|$|R
5000|$|The Galápagos land iguanas {{comprise}} the genus Conolophus of the Galápagos Islands. The name Conolophus {{is derived from}} two Greek words: conos (κώνος) meaning [...] "spiny" [...] and lophos (λοφος) meaning [...] "crest" [...] or [...] "plume", denoting <b>the</b> spiny crests <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> these species.g ...|$|R
50|$|The Desert Region, {{which is}} larger and sparsely {{populated}} with portions of Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Imperial, and San Diego counties. The {{division between the}} Coastal Region and the Inland Empire/Imperial Valley winds <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> coastal mountain ranges such as the Santa Ana Mountains.|$|R
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions {{placed it on the}} hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Zippers are {{lines of}} paler hairs running {{vertically}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the animal's leg, usually from the hoof to the knee. Because they consist of paler hairs and are found where horses often have feathering, zippers are {{considered by some}} to be guard hairs.|$|E
25|$|The loop was signalled with up {{home and}} down home, but no starters. At first only a signal box was present, {{with a long}} {{unbroken}} fence running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the platforms and no other buildings or lighting. The other station buildings and facilities were probably added circa 1908. Crossing gates protected level crossings {{at both ends of}} the station.|$|E
50|$|Camden Passage is a {{pedestrian}} passage off Upper Street in the London Borough of Islington. The passage {{is known for}} its many antique shops, and hosts an antique market on Wednesdays and Saturday mornings. It was built, as an alley, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> houses on Upper Street, then Islington High Street, in 1767.|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus nitida, {{commonly}} known as the Smithton Peppermint, is a eucalypt which is native to eastern Australia. In southwest Tasmania it is often seen growing in thickets <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> rivers and in the floors of valleys amidst environments otherwise dominated by heathland. It was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1856.|$|R
50|$|North of {{the centre}} of London, Camden Passage is a {{pedestrian}} passage off Upper Street in the London Borough of Islington, famous because of its many antiques shops, and an antique market on Wednesdays and Saturday mornings. It was built, as an alley, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> houses on Upper Street, then Islington High Street, in 1767.|$|R
25|$|The suburb {{is split}} {{in half by}} Greenhill Road, to the north there are {{residential}} dwellings and the park. To {{the south and east}} are the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges with continued residential properties. Hazelwood Park is bounded to the north by Knightsbridge Road, to the east by Glynburn Road, to the south by Cooper Place and to the west by Devereux Road and a line <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the blocks between Hazelwood and Tusmore avenues.|$|E
25|$|The face-down {{swimming}} position {{allows for}} a good range of motion of the arm in the water, {{as compared to the}} backstroke, where the hands cannot be moved easily <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the spine. The above-water recovery of the stroke reduces drag, compared to the underwater recovery of breaststroke. The alternating arms also allow some rolling movement of the body for an easier recovery compared to, for example, butterfly. Finally, the alternating arm stroke makes for a relatively constant speed throughout the cycle.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} ligaments {{involved in the}} holding together of the vertebrae in the column, and in the column's movement. The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments extend {{the length of the}} vertebral column along the front and back of the vertebral bodies. The interspinous ligaments connect the adjoining spinous processes of the vertebrae. The supraspinous ligament extends the length of the spine running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the spinous processes, from the sacrum to the seventh cervical vertebra. From there it is continuous with the nuchal ligament.|$|E

25|$|These former private {{quarters}} of the Lord Lieutenant were built as five interconnecting rooms running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the building, adjoining the spine corridor that separates them from the state drawing room. Completely rebuilt in the 1960s following fire in 1941, the rooms maintain the original courtly sequence and today are used as ancillary drawing and meeting rooms to the principal apartments. The last dignitary {{to stay in the}} royal bedrooms was Margaret Thatcher, who spent a night there with her husband Dennis during one of the European Council meetings held in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The RS-68 {{engine is}} mounted {{to the lower}} thrust {{structure}} of the vehicle by a four-legged (quadrapod) thrust frame, and enclosed in a protective composite conical thermal shield. Above the thrust structure is an aluminum isogrid (a grid pattern machined out of {{the inside of the}} tank to reduce weight) liquid hydrogen tank, followed by a composite cylinder called the centerbody, an aluminum isogrid liquid oxygen tank, and a forward skirt. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the CBC is a cable tunnel to hold electrical and signal lines, and a feedline to carry the liquid oxygen to the RS-68 from the tank. The CBC is of a constant, 5-meter (16.4ft) diameter.|$|E
25|$|Westward Ho!, {{the busiest}} station, {{had its own}} Station Master, Mr. MacLaughlan; it had two {{platform}}s, platform lighting, a passing loop, ticket office, an 8-lever signal box and a 2-lever ground frame operated by Mr. Spry; a waiting room, refreshment room, bookstall, level crossing gates and a Concert Hall called the Station Hall. A siding ran to the Westward Ho! Gas Works. An early photograph shows Westward Ho! with only the signal box and a long unbroken fence running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the platforms with no other buildings or lighting. The similarity in appearance and construction between the Westward Ho! and Appledore platform buildings suggests that they were both built at the same time, circa 1908.|$|E

50|$|University Avenue was an {{arterial}} road in west Strathcona, Alberta, Canada. It was formed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> farm lots {{west of the}} yet to be incorporated town of Strathcona, causing it to run parallel with the North Saskatchewan River to the north. The farm lots later became the University of Alberta campus, which was established in 1908. After the amalgamation with Edmonton, and as the grid streets expanded, University Avenue was broken up, however most of it still remains as residential streets.|$|R
5000|$|Town fortifications - Parts {{of walls}} {{from the former}} {{trapezoidal}} town fortifications, possibly from the earlier half of the 14th century; preserved, a stretch <b>of</b> wall <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses on Burgweg and west of the Evangelical church; at Burgweg 6 a reconstructed gate; parts of a wall in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> parts <b>of</b> Eifelstraße 13 and 15, beside those reconstructed wall with parapet walk; remnants of a tower and a gateway arch near Marktstraße 14; parallel to Marktstraße and below the Evangelical church parts of the moat {{on the north side}} ...|$|R
25|$|African trypanosomiasis {{symptoms}} {{occur in}} two stages. The first stage, {{known as the}} hemolymphatic phase, is characterized by fever, headaches, joint pains, and itching. Fever is intermittent, with attacks lasting from a day to a week, separated by intervals of {{a few days to}} a month or longer. Invasion of the circulatory and lymphatic systems by the parasites is associated with severe swelling of lymph nodes, often to tremendous sizes. Winterbottom's sign, the tell-tale swollen lymph nodes <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the neck, may appear. Occasionally, a chancre (red sore) will develop at the location of the tsetse fly bite. If left untreated, the disease overcomes the host's defenses and can cause more extensive damage, broadening symptoms to include anemia, endocrine, cardiac, and kidney dysfunctions.|$|E
25|$|Further to the southwest, Narrow Street, Limehouse's {{historic}} spine, {{which runs}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the Thames wharves, boasts {{one of the}} few surviving early Georgian terraces in London. Next to the terrace is the historic Grapes pub, rebuilt in 1720 and well-known to Charles Dickens, featuring as the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters in Our Mutual Friend. A few doors along was Booty's Riverside Bar but this closed down in 2012. Almost every building {{on the other side of}} Narrow Street was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, including hundreds of houses, Taylor Walker & Co's Barley Mow Brewery and a school. One notable exception is a former public house, known locally as 'The House They Left Behind', because it was the only Victorian terrace to survive. It still stands today, with the aid of three large supporting pillars.|$|E
500|$|In {{all except}} the bristle millipedes, {{copulation}} occurs {{with the two}} individuals facing one another. Copulation may be preceded by male behaviours such as tapping with antennae, running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the female, offering edible glandular secretions, {{or in the case}} of some pill-millipedes, stridulation or [...] "chirping". During copulation in most millipedes, the male positions his seventh segment in front of the female's third segment, and may insert his gonopods to extrude the vulvae before bending his body to deposit sperm onto his gonopods and reinserting the [...] "charged" [...] gonopods into the female.|$|E
50|$|The upper (dorsal) {{coloration}} varies between grayish, gray-olive, brown-olive, {{brown and}} olive. The anterior {{end of the}} dorsum is usually grayish, whereas the posterior two thirds of body and tail are brownish. The subcaudal scales (scales below the tail) are immaculate yellow in color. There are 2 to 10 scale rows in males and 2 to 6 in females, with a maximum of 12 scale rows at midbody. The ventral (belly) scales number from 163 to 181. A longitudinal ridge (keel) is present <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> females.|$|R
50|$|In the NFL {{and other}} venues {{where there is}} a zone behind the sidelines, all three poles are placed somewhere <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> line <b>of</b> this zone. Otherwise, the poles are placed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> sideline.|$|R

500|$|The {{area around}} the street {{was known as the}} rookery of St Giles, which {{developed}} in the 18th century as an unplanned slum {{to the west of the}} City, and was described as a [...] "Pandora's box of pollution, plague and pestilence". Though much of the area was cleared by the end of the 19th century, Denmark Street is the only street in London to retain 17th-century terraced facades on both sides. In 2010, a study by Camden London Borough Council suggested that only six other streets in London have a comparable heritage to Denmark Street. A small court connected by passages (originally known as Dudley Court, then Denmark Court and now known as Denmark Place) runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the north side of the street, connecting to it via an opening at No. 27.|$|E
500|$|Production on Jurassic Park began {{before the}} {{discovery}} of the large dromaeosaurid Utahraptor was made public in 1991, but as Jody Duncan wrote about this discovery: [...] "Later, after we had designed and built the Raptor, there was a discovery of a Raptor skeleton in Utah, which they labeled 'super-slasher'. They had uncovered the largest Velociraptor to date - and it measured five-and-a-half-feet tall, just like ours. So we designed it, we built it, and then they discovered it. That still boggles my mind." [...] Spielberg was particularly pleased with {{the discovery of}} the Utahraptor because of the boost it gave to the velociraptors in his film. Spielberg's name was briefly considered for naming of the new dinosaur. In reality, Velociraptor, like many other maniraptoran theropods, was covered in feathers. Jurassic Park and its sequel [...] were released before this discovery, so the creatures in both films are depicted as featherless with scales all over in the manner of modern reptiles. For Jurassic Park III, the male Velociraptor was given quill-like structures <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head and neck. While this was the extent to which CGI effects were able to render feathers at the time, the structures do not resemble the down-like feathers real-life dromaeosaurids bore or the fully developed arm feathers, akin to the wing feathers of modern birds, borne by Velociraptor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{color of}} the walls and seats was sand. The rake of the seats was changed in 1983 to give the audience better sightlines and add additional seats. A row of windows runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the theater. Window coverings in Wright's design were later requested by Paul Baker because [...] "theater was not just performed at night." ...|$|E
