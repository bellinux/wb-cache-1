25|$|The task of 13th Corps was {{to cross}} the Straits and land in two small bays north of Reggio. The 1st Canadian Division, landing at Fox Beach, a short {{distance}} north of Reggio, were to capture {{the town and the}} airfield south of town, while 5th Division took San Giovanni, to the north, and the coastline to Canitello. The artillery barrage on the beach was planned {{to take advantage of the}} LCA's splinter-proof <b>armoured</b> <b>protection.</b> The barrage would lift from the beach only moments before touchdown for the LCAs. Apart from some craft landing in the wrong places, and some mixing of the divisions, the assault troops landed without difficulty and with little hindrance from the enemy. Following the assault phase, the LCAs were used to ferry supplies. By the evening of D+1 the landing of supplies had gone so well that the build-up was 1½ days ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 1940 the German Wehrmacht began Fall Gelb (Case Yellow); an {{invasion}} of Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Belgium and France. 3 Squadron were ordered to readiness that morning and flew to Merville, Nord in France. 3 and 79 Squadron were to form part of 63 Wing RAF. As they crossed the English Channel at 05:30 GMT, they were directed to a Ju 88 which they chased to the Dutch border without success and returned to England refuel. After landing the squadron was ordered to relocate to France. They were told the German Army had invaded France and the Low Countries. They reached Merville and found they were under-equipped in comparison to other squadrons that had been there since September 1939. The squadrons of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) possessed self-sealing fuel tanks, <b>armoured</b> <b>protection</b> for the pilot, and more powerful radio crystals.|$|E
500|$|The reverse in German {{military}} fortunes after 1943 and {{the appearance}} of huge numbers of well-armoured Soviet tanks caused Junkers to adapt the existing design to combat this new threat. The Henschel Hs 129B had proved a potent ground attack weapon, but its large fuel tanks made it vulnerable to enemy fire, prompting the RLM to say [...] "that in the shortest possible time a replacement of the Hs 129 type must take place." [...] With Soviet tanks the priority targets, the development of a further variant as a successor to the Ju 87D began in November 1942. On 3 November, Erhard Milch raised the question of replacing the Ju 87, or redesigning it altogether. It was decided to keep the design as it was, but the power-plant was upgraded to a Junkers Jumo 211J, and two [...] cannons were added. The variant was also designed to carry a [...] free-fall bomb load. Furthermore, the <b>armoured</b> <b>protection</b> of the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik - a feature pioneered by the 1916-17 origin Junkers J.I all-metal sesquiplane of World War I Imperial Germany's Luftstreitkräfte - was copied to protect the crew from ground fire now that the Ju 87 would be required to conduct low level attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Land {{clearing}} operations {{had been}} undertaken by 1st Field Squadron since {{the occupation of}} Nui Dat to improve base defences and observation. Later they were extended for tactical purposes to open up key routes within Phuoc Tuy by removing vegetation to deny cover and concealment to the Viet Cong, and also provided arable land for villagers {{as part of the}} Pacification program. In March 1968, a dedicated Land Clearing Team was formed by 17th Construction Squadron elements at Nui Dat to supplement existing arrangements. One particular operation, codenamed [...] "Cooktown Orchid" [...] conducted in April 1968, saw a large element of Plant Troop deploy under infantry and <b>armoured</b> <b>protection</b> to clear undergrowth and trees {{in the foothills of the}} Long Hai mountains. Land clearance operations proved quite dangerous for the plant operators who were exposed to land mines and booby traps, as well as to attack by small arms and other direct fire weapons. During this operation one D8 bulldozer was destroyed, and a sapper injured when an RPG round hit the dozer he was operating. In 1969 the squadron continued with land clearing tasks within the 1 ATF area of operations. During the operation, numerous bunker systems were uncovered and the D8 dozers detonated many mines. In August 1969, 9 Troop assisted in replacing a sabotaged bridge with a [...] floating pontoon bridge. The enemy had blown the bridge on National Route 51, [...] south-east of Saigon. The troop, working with the US Engineers, took only 13 hours to re-open the road.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Olifant Mk1A was {{superseded}} by the Olifant Mk1B, which incorporated major improvements in armour protection, {{a slightly more}} powerful engine, a double <b>armoured</b> floor for <b>protection</b> against mines, and a torsion bar suspension.|$|R
5000|$|In 1903, a French {{artillery}} captain named Léon Levavasseur {{proposed the}} Levavasseur project, a canon autopropulseur ("self-propelled cannon"), moved by a caterpillar system and fully <b>armoured</b> for <b>protection.</b> Powered by an 80 hp petrol engine, [...] "the Levavasseur machine {{would have had}} a crew of three, storage for ammunition, and a cross-country ability", but the viability of the project was disputed by the Artillery Technical Committee, until it was formally abandoned in 1908 when it was known that a caterpillar tractor had been developed, the Hornsby of engineer David Roberts.|$|R
50|$|The {{protected}} cruiser {{is a type}} {{of naval}} cruiser of the late 19th century, so known because its <b>armoured</b> deck offered <b>protection</b> for vital machine spaces from fragments caused by exploding shells above.

50|$|Dropships {{typically}} {{possess a}} short range and are designed only {{to work in}} conjunction with a larger orbiting mothership or vessel that is ill suited to land on the surface. Dropships are usually capable of both atmospheric and space flight (or, in some examples, underwater travel), differing from craft only capable of flight in one of those mediums. The roles of Dropships are generally military in nature, including landing troops or equipment on a planet. Dropships featured tend to be portrayed as heavily armed and <b>armoured,</b> providing <b>protection</b> for troops from surface fire, similar to helicopters currently employed by military forces.|$|R
5000|$|In modern tanks, {{the turret}} is <b>armoured</b> for crew <b>protection</b> and rotates a full 360 degrees {{carrying}} a single large-calibre tank gun, typically {{in the range}} of 105 mm to 125 mm calibre.

50|$|Although {{maligned}} by age {{and further}} deteriorating {{as a result of}} hard use and the difficulty in obtaining spares from the United Kingdom, Ferrets continued to be employed for counter-insurgency operations and protective duties. Equipped with a single heavy machine gun, Browning medium machine guns, or a 20mm Hispano-Suiza HS.820 anti-aircraft gun, they were retrofitted with new motors and larger fuel tanks. RhACR units also used MAP-45 and MAP-75 armoured personnel carriers, which, although lightly armed and <b>armoured,</b> provided excellent <b>protection</b> for their embarked infantry sections against land mines. Local manufacturers either converted an older chassis into a MAP or created an entirely new one, installing engines stripped from a menagerie of imported commercial vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{specified}} {{technical requirements}} included a 1,100 m (3,610 ft) takeoff distance over a 15 m (49 ft) obstacle, {{the capability to}} operate from semi-prepared grass airstrips and roads, a maximum speed of Mach 0.95, a range of 280 km (170 mi) with 10 minutes over the target while possessing a maximum of 2,200 kg (4,850 lb) empty weight and 4,700 kg (10,360 lb) max weight. Equipment requirements were the presence of <b>armoured</b> <b>protection</b> for the pilot and the fuel tanks along with alternative arrangements of 4 × 12.7 mm (.5 in) guns or 2 × 20 mm or 30 mm cannons. These operational specifications were viewed as not being straightforward to fulfil at that time.|$|E
5000|$|The Ordnance QF 2-pounder (QF {{denoting}} [...] "quick firing"), {{or simply}} [...] "2 pounder gun", was a 40 mm British anti-tank and vehicle-mounted gun, {{employed in the}} Second World War. It was actively used in the Battle of France, and during the North Africa Campaign. As Axis tanks improved in <b>armoured</b> <b>protection,</b> it lost effectiveness, and it was gradually replaced by the 6-pounder, starting in 1942, though some remained in service {{until the end of}} the war. In its vehicle-mounted variant, the 2-pounder was also a common main gun on British tanks early in World War II, and was a typical main armament of armoured cars, such as the Daimler, throughout the war.|$|E
50|$|BTR-60PB {{armed with}} 100 mm gun in a heavily {{modified}} turret from the T-54. The hull is modified as well {{since the two}} hand rails {{on the side of}} the hull are gone and the other two are moved to the center of the hull between the upper and lower parts of the side of the hull. The lights in the front received <b>armoured</b> <b>protection.</b> The vehicle has two rear-view mirrors in the front corners of the hull (one on each side) The chassis has also been modified as the vehicle has a BTR-80 style straight chassis with no slope near the engine compartment. Because of the size of the new turret the vehicle is most probably no longer an APC but an armoured car.|$|E
50|$|The first {{attacks on}} a ship by an {{underwater}} vehicle are generally {{believed to have been}} during the American Revolutionary War, using what would now be called a naval mine but what then was called a torpedo, though various attempts to build submarines had been made before this. The first self-propelled torpedo was invented in 1863 and launched from surface craft. The first submarine with a torpedo was Nordenfelt I built in 1884-1885, though it had been proposed earlier. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, the submarine was a significant threat. By the start of the First World War nearly 300 submarines were in service. Some warships were fitted with an <b>armoured</b> belt as <b>protection</b> against torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|The SS Great Eastern liner made by Isambard Kingdom Brunel was {{employed}} as a cable laying ship.Its size made it the first choice to lay the original cables that linked the administrative outposts of the British Empire. The first European cable was not a success, its small diameter created too great a resistance to the voltage used and the signal {{was too weak to}} be reliable. An attempt to increase the voltage pressure resulted in insulation breakdown and subsequent failure of the telegraph link. The cables are heavily <b>armoured</b> for <b>protection</b> against damage as they come ashore, a lighter construction technique is used at depth on the ocean floor. Modern cables are usually Fibre optic and are much lighter in construction, international information is now made available of the locations of submarine cables. When the system was completed, central government in Britain had a method of effective communication with its civil servants and military commanders throughout the world. At the outbreak of World War II, the existing surface installations were thought to be far too vulnerable to attack, and in 1941, miners were employed to cut tunnels into the solid granite of the valley's hillside to house the telegraphy equipment. Porthcurno telegraphy facility closed in 1970, 100 years after it first began its operations.|$|R

5000|$|Beginning on 18 June 1918, the Royal Air Force (formerly the Royal Flying Corps) ordered {{large numbers}} of the Sopwith TF.2 Salamander, a single seat biplane.

Of the 37 Salamanders produced {{before the end of}} October 1918, only two were delivered to France, and the war ended before those planes could see action. Whether the Salamander should be considered in more modern parlance as a fighter-bomber or a dive bomber again depends on the definition of dive.

50|$|The 2nd Light Division {{created on}} 10 November 1938 {{from the region}} of Thuringia. The light {{divisions}} were created under the instigation of the cavalry arm of the German Army, who feared their scouting and screening roles were being {{taken over by the}} Panzerwaffe. The division was designed to provide mobility and some <b>armoured</b> <b>protection</b> to its forces, and was composed of the 6th and 7th Mechanized Cavalry Regiments, the 7th Reconnaissance Regiment, and the 66th Panzer Battalion. These were supported by the 78th Artillery Regiment, the 58th Engineer Battalion and the 42nd Anti-tank Battalion. Its single panzer battalion was equipped with the Panzer I training tank and the Panzer II interim production tank. Both these vehicles were small, lightly armed and lightly armoured. In 1939 the division was part of the German 10th Army during the Invasion of Poland.|$|E

5000|$|The {{introduction}} of Krupp armour in six inch thickness rendered the [...] "armoured" [...] protection scheme more effective {{for the largest}} first class cruisers, and no large first class protected cruisers were built after 1898. The smaller cruisers, unable to bear the weight of heavy armoured belts retained the [...] "protected" [...] scheme up to 1905, when the last units of the [...] and es were completed. There was a general hiatus in British cruiser production after this time, apart from a few classes of small, fast scout cruisers for fleet duties. When the Royal Navy began building larger cruisers (>4,000 tons) again around 1910, they used a mix of armoured decks and/or <b>armoured</b> belts for <b>protection,</b> depending on class. These modern, turbine powered cruisers are properly classified as light cruisers.|$|R
500|$|The Bristols were {{considered}} protected cruisers, with an <b>armoured</b> deck providing <b>protection</b> for the ships' vitals. The armoured deck was [...] thick over the magazines and machinery, [...] over the steering gear and [...] elsewhere. The conning tower {{was protected by}} [...] of armour, with the gun shields having [...] armour, as did the ammunition hoists. As the protective deck was at the waterline, the ships were given a large metacentric height {{so that they would}} remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships rolling badly making them poor gun platforms. One problem with the armour of the Bristols, which was shared with the other Town-class ships, was the sizable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap and made the guns' crews vulnerable to leg injuries in combat.|$|R
