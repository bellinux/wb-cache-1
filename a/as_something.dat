5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body <b>as</b> <b>something</b> that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel <b>as</b> <b>something</b> only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E

5|$|Fluent in Pashto, English, and Urdu, Yousafzai {{was educated}} mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, {{who is a}} poet, school owner, and an {{educational}} activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School. She once stated to an interviewer that {{she would like to}} become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter <b>as</b> <b>something</b> entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.|$|E
5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, a troop sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve <b>as</b> <b>something</b> of a mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, {{reducing the amount of}} transit time required and increasing travel efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The Roseberys' {{house party}} would leave Dalmeny and tour {{towns and cities}} across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the {{speakers}} often addressing vast crowds {{from the back of}} an American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings have been described <b>as</b> <b>something</b> between a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.|$|E

5|$|The now-common trope {{of dinosaurs}} {{existing}} in isolated locations in today's world {{appeared at the}} same time, with Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 book The Lost World and the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs as pioneers. The Lost World crossed into the movies in 1925, setting heights for special effects and attempts at scientific accuracy. It is unusual, even today, for attempting to portray dinosaurs <b>as</b> <b>something</b> other than monsters that spent their lives in combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded <b>as</b> <b>something</b> of a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, {{with the hope}} of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E
5|$|To {{art critic}} Robert Hughes, the {{painting}} represents {{the theme of}} family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water. Historian Lizabeth Cohen says that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker with a job or a government protecting the hungry and homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was not as much a government responsibility <b>as</b> <b>something</b> born from participation in the mass consumer economy.|$|E

5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised <b>as</b> <b>something</b> out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp <b>as</b> <b>something</b> of a villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than}} a tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E

5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight <b>as</b> <b>something</b> of a bit player in their lives. As I got {{further into the}} Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is {{different}} from liking them as characters, of course—I {{wanted to have a}} character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them <b>as</b> <b>something</b> else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{received}} a formal education at Diocletian's court, {{where he learned}} Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy. The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city. Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held <b>as</b> <b>something</b> of a hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served {{in a variety of}} tribunates; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299AD). By late 305AD, he had become a tribune of the first order, a tribunus ordinis primi.|$|E
