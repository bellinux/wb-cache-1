40|$|The project {{elaborated}} {{design of}} two manufacturing technologies for component called counterpart of ball from <b>alluminum</b> <b>alloy.</b> Based on the literature study and {{consultation with the}} company CNC program was made for machining technology. For pressure casting the part was modified according to the technological requirements. Comparing these technologies showed preferable method of manufacturing for mass production...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{present the}} effect of filler {{material}} to the corrosion behavior of AA 6061 <b>alluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> welded joint. Study were made to observe {{the effect of}} filler material type ER 4043, ER 047 and the increment of welding current, 30 A, 35 A, and 40 A on corrosion rate of welded AA 6061 joints. Welding was done by using Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding and corrosion test was conducted in a lab using potentiostat. From the experiment, specimens with the highest corrosion rate is specimen 4 with the value of corrosion rate 2. 88 mmpy and specimen with the lowest value of corrosion rate is specimen 3 with the value as low as 0. 32828 mmpy. As the conclusion, filler material type ER 4043 increase corrosion resistance on the welding joint and current 40 A is better in order the heighten the corrosion resistance of the material...|$|R
40|$|The NASA-supported {{program at}} the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) to develop carbon fiber-aluminum matrix {{composites}} is described. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used to uniformly deposit thin, smooth, continuous coats of TiC on the fibers of graphite tows. Wet chemical coating of fibers, followed by high-temperature treatment, was also used, but showed little promise as an alternative coating method. Strength measurements on CVD coated fiber tows showed that thin carbide coats can add to fiber strength. The ability of aluminum alloys to wet TiC was successfully demonstrated using TiC-coated graphite surfaces. Pressure-infiltration of TiC- and ZrC-coated fiber tows with aluminum alloys was only partially successful. Experiments were performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of carbide coats on carbon as barriers to prevent reaction between <b>alluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> and carbon. Initial results indicate that composites of aluminum and carbide-coated graphite are stable for long periods of time at temperatures near the alloy solidus...|$|R
