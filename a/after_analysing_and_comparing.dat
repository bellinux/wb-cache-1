40|$|ABSTRACT: The field {{measurements}} and the questionnaire surveys of indoor environment in twenty urban residential buildings, which {{were held in}} October 2005 and December 2005 in Chongqing, are presented in the paper. The {{field measurements}} consist of thermal environment, indoor air quality, visual environment and acoustical environment in these buildings, while the questionnaire surveys reveal building characteristics, occupants ’ life styles and the subjective prediction of indoor environment. <b>After</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparing</b> the results of objective tests and subjective surveys, the comprehensive evaluation {{of the study is}} drawn as follows: relative humidity is generally above 70 % and some proper measures are required to remove the atmosphere moisture. 35 % of residential buildings exceed the national standard of formaldehyde concentration. The toilets are severely polluted due to the too high ammonia concentration. However, the total occupant satisfaction is more than 80 %, so the indoor air quality reaches the acceptable state...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose for}} this essay {{was to find}} out what {{differences}} there are between the adjectives generous and greedy regarding usage frequency and in what contexts they are used. My research for this paper is based on a computer search program called MP 2. 2 which was applied to the A files of the British National Corpus. <b>After</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparing</b> the two adjectives, the following conclusion was drawn: Generous was five times as often used compared to greedy, and a possibility why this is so may be that people prefer to use more positively loaded words. The fact that generous had a better result than greedy, may be a reason why this adjective was used in so many more metaphorical expressions than greedy, because if people often use a word, sooner or later they will come up with new areas of usage. In the metaphorical expressions generous often signified quantity, whereas greedy was extended to the meaning of “taking something more figuratively”. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is {{the distribution of}} radioactive strontium in organism. The thesis {{is divided into three}} main parts. In the first part I describe general problems of radioactive strontium, talk about possible ways of entrance of this radionuclide into organism and discuss resulting health hazards. In the second part I mentioned three case studies dealing with contamination by radioactive strontium. The first case study describes the long term contamination by 90 Sr in the Techa river population. The second one is the study of a group of volunteers who received 85 Sr and subsequently the excretion, elimination and retention of this radionuclide in the organism of the volunteers were observed. The last case study describes the influence of the external radiation on distribution of the radioactive strontium in the organism of rats. The third part of my graduation thesis contains the discussion on the problem of distribution of radioactive strontium in the organism of mammals. The aim of my bachelors thesis was to make analysis of the distribution of radioactive strontium in organism according to different ways of its entrance into the organism. My hypothesis was that the degree of damage to the organism does not depend on the way of entrance of this radioactive strontium into the organism. The hypothesis was rejected <b>after</b> I <b>analysed</b> <b>and</b> <b>compared</b> all avaliable data...|$|R

However, there is limited research on the topic, more specifically in connection with charitable events. Therefore, through the use of qualitative and quantitative research methods, this dissertation will contribute to the developing topic of social networking, and the impact it has on charitable events. Quantitative research has been carried out on 147 event attendees to charitable events, and qualitative research was conducted through group interviews, which were carried out with three charitable organisations that use social networking as part of their marketing strategy. In doing so, this will provide different viewpoints on the topic at hand and a range of opinions from several charities. The rich data collected was analysed and referred back to the literature where appropriate. Additionally, the categorisations of any potential themes were established through thematic data analysis. Accordingly, the themes for the study were developed and highlighted in connection to the aim, which included the consideration into the impacts of social networking sites as a marketing aspect for charitable events. Outcomes of the study were clarified <b>after</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparing</b> the results with the literature review.

Though it allows a large supporting stiffness, small interference of the streamline flow and a high measuring precision for large attack angle, it can not be used in measuring the dynamic derivatives. 3) 	Wire-driven parallel suspension system has opened a new horizon for measuring the static and dynamic derivatives of the aircraft in LSWT. Using the same system based on position control and force control in robotics, it allows to realize the free flight of the aircraft model and to obtain the static and dynamic derivatives. However, the results given in this Chapter can only be considered as a preliminary step in establishing feasibility，although the wire-driven parallel suspension system is a very interesting design, and it may be sufficiently developed into a routine practical system...|$|E

Social media is a topic, which has been researched across many different sectors, however it has not been addressed with aspects to events experience and marketing promotion. Therefore through the use of qualitative research methods, this dissertation will contribute to the already existing research into social media, whilst relating it to event experience, satisfaction and promotion. Qualitative research has been carried out via the use of a focus group and semi-structured individual interviews, within the students of Queen Margaret University. The data collected was categorised into any potential themes, and then analysed and referred back to the literature.

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore 18 F-FET kinetics and tumour-to-background contrast in meningiomas of various histologies. MethodsA group of 24 patients with suspected cerebral meningioma on MRI/CT had an additional dynamic 18 F-FET PET scan prior to surgery. Time–activity curves (TAC) of 18 F-FET uptake in the tumours and tumour-to-brain ratios (TBR) for early (3 – 14 min after injection) and late 18 F-FET uptake (20 – 40 min <b>after</b> injection) were <b>analysed</b> <b>and</b> <b>compared</b> with histological subtypes and WHO grade. 18 F-FET uptake in critical structures in the skull base was also evaluated in terms of tumour-to-tissue (T/Tis) ratio.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a disease}} which affects hyaline {{cartilage}} within the joint and leads to severe pain for the patient. Chondrocytes within the cartilage of OA patients have a limited capability to repair lesions in the tissue and as a result, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) which {{have the ability to}} differentiate into cartilage, are being investigated for cell- based therapies for OA. One restriction for the use of BMSCs in clinical trials is the rarity and heterogeneity of the starting population. It is therefore important to identify cell surface markers for BMSCs which produce a high quality cartilage matrix after many population doublings in vitro. Tissue engineered cartilage produced by BMSCs from OA patients at early and late passage <b>after</b> thawing was <b>analysed</b> <b>and</b> <b>compared</b> <b>and</b> {{it was found that the}} amount and quality of cartilage matrix was significantly reduced at late passage. To identify the most chondrogenic cells, individual BMSCs were sorted from five OA patients using flow cytometry, cultured for 20 population doublings and assessed for their cartilage tissue engineering capacity. BMSC clones which produced high quality tissue engineered cartilage were compared with BMSCs which produced a low quality cartilage using microarray analysis to find the genetic identities of the different populations. These markers were tested at the protein level using flow cytometric analysis and one protein, HLA DR was identified as a potential marker for poorly chondrogenic BMSCs. HLA DR positive cells were stably removed from the whole population and removal of these cells did not affect the quality of tissue engineered cartilage produced. Two protein markers for the most chondrogenic BMSCs were identified and investigated, FGFR- 2 and ROR- 2. There were no significant differences in the quality of tissue engineered cartilage produced by FGFR 2 positive and negative populations. ROR- 2 expression increased in culture as cells became confluent and cells cultured at a high cell density expressing increased ROR- 2 had a trend to produce higher quality tissue engineered cartilage than those cultured at low density before chondrogenic analysis. These results highlight the heterogeneity in the cartilage producing capabilities of the BMSC population at the level of the individual cell and document the discovery of ROR- 2 as a potential marker for a BMSC population which could be utilised in trials of BMSC based therapies for OA in the future.

40|$|Impact {{assessment}} is an often-heard term {{on the development}} scene. It is usually used loosely and vaguely to indicate the effect or results of interventions by development programmes. <b>After</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparing</b> various development NGOs, Chris Roche, the author of Impact Assessment for Development Agencies, defines impact assessment roughly as 'a systematic analysis of lasting and significant changes, both positive and negative, in people s life brought about by a given action or a series of actions'. So impact is not a direct intervention such as a dam, a credit system or a seed supply programme but about how that changes real life for the beneficiaries. The book presents a theoretical overview of the subject {{as well as the}} design of impact assessment processes and the different tools and methods available {{in a wide range of}} development work.

40|$|Abstract: We propose {{and discuss}} the {{application}} of Artificial Intelligence techniques to the classification of stellar spectra. Two types of systems are considered, knowledge-based systems (Expert Systems) and different classes of neural networks. <b>After</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparing</b> the performance of both systems in the classification of stellar spectra, we reach the conclusion that neural networks are more adequate to determine the spectral types and luminosity of stars, whereas knowledge-based systems are more performative in determining global temperatures. In {{order to determine the}} best approach to the classification of each spectrum type, we describe and analyse the performance and results of various neural networks models. Backpropagation networks, self-organising maps and RBF networks in particular were designed and tested, through the implementation of different topologies, to obtain the global classification, spectral type and luminosity of stars. The best networks reached a success rate of approximately 97 % for a sample of 100 testing spectra. The morphological analysis algorithms that were developed in the knowledgebased systems are used to extract and measure spectral features, and to obtain the input patterns of the neural networks. Some networks were trained with this parameterisation, others with flux values of specific spectral zones; it was the first strategy that resulted in a better performance. Our approach is focused on the integration of several techniques in a unique hybrid system. In particular, signal processing, expert systems, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks are integrated by means of a relational database, which allows us to structure the collected astronomical data and to contrast the results of the different classification methods. In addition, we designed several models of artificial neural networks that were trained with synthetic spectra, and included them as an alternative classification method. 153 Iciar Carricajo et al...|$|E
40|$|The Night Owl and Other Poems” is a {{collection}} of poems that explores four areas of the human condition, destruction, humanity, sorrow and love, and explores how these four areas are affected under a variety of experiences and situations. Written during my travels throughout Asia and Europe, the collection uses the spectrum of my interactions during this time to interrogate the ideologies that motivate people’s actions in the world. The collection of poems is not penned in a particular style but erratically dances through a gamut of poetic forms and schools mirroring the turbulence of my emotions and their manifestations during this period. Each poem is spoken from the viewpoint of a different character, building on the concept that we all have multiple characters harbouring inside our minds, and each character is alive in different ways, leading to an often jarring juxtaposition of emotional tone between the works. Each section of the poetic manuscript relies heavily on abstract and surreal imagery. It transitions from sexual and destructive landscapes to internal and nature laden imagery and was heavily influenced by a combination of Beat poets, Romantic poets and Modern poets such as Allen Ginsberg, Seamus Heaney, Langston Hughes and Galway Kinnell. Supplementing the poetic collection is my philosophical manifesto exploring the unassailable relationship between human imagination and poetry through the application and analysis of objective procedural poetic techniques, where I argue that the human imagination is intrinsically married to poetry and the two cannot be divorced. It begins by laying out five explorative hypotheses to be tested. The philosophy then defines the term “objective procedural poetry” and explores the regions of the poetic sphere that have used or relied on this concept, untangling the history and complex relationship of subjectivity and objectivity in the composition of a poem. Following this, a variety of objective translational and non-translational transformations are applied on a range of my own poetry and that of others, <b>after</b> which I <b>analyse</b> <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> the outcomes to determine if a new self-standing artistic work has been derived or alternatively whether the original has been reimagined in a new artistic light. My philosophy then explores and dissects two specific areas of poetry, DADA and the “cut up”, <b>and</b> <b>compares</b> these techniques <b>and</b> their outcomes with the earlier results. Drawing on the extensive collection of examples, tests, results and analysis produced and conducted throughout the work, the philosophy concludes by affirming that the five hypothesis {{at the beginning of the}} philosophy have been adjudged true. Purely objective production of poetry does not result in artistic works, and thus every poetic work to a degree must be founded in the use of the subjective human imagination and condition...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. P-glycoprotein (p-gp), {{a member}} of the {{superfamily}} ATP-binding cassette (ABC) is known to be present in the absorptive enterocytes of the gastro-intestinal tract and many other tissues in the body where it acts mainly as a defence mechanism against exogenous assault. Defects in p-gp is speculated to result in the development of diseases as mutations in genes are causes of numerous diseases in the metabolic mosaic that underlies health. Due to the importance of p-gp, particularly in the intestines, mutation of the gene encoding this protein may lead to the presence of unusual compounds, xenobiotics in the body and the urine. It is thought that defective p-gp in the intestine might also lead to the absorption of some metabolites of bacterial origin and residue of digestion which normally would have been refluxed back into the gut by the p-gp. To investigate if defective p-gp may be involved in the manifestation of unusual compounds and organic acids in the urine, inhibition of intestinal p-gp was proposed. Grapefruit juice (GJ), a natural beverage commonly taken by the majority of the populace has been reported to inhibit p-gp activity in the intestine (Spahn-Langguth & Langguth, 2001). Grapefruit juice was administered to healthy subjects in this study and the sugars and organic acids content of the urine sample <b>after</b> administration was <b>analysed</b> <b>and</b> <b>compared</b> with the controls (urine samples taken from the same set of subjects before grapefruit juice administration). These were determined by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry respectively. The thin layer chromatography revealed that {{there was no difference between}} the concentrations of sugars in the control and samples after the administration of grapefruit juice. This might indicate that the inhibition of p-gp or mutation of the gene encoding p-gp does not result in the presence of sugars in the urine. The analysis of organic acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry method showed a remarkable difference between the organic acids present in the controls and urine samples after the administration of grapefruit juice as well as their concentrations. The organic acids solely from microbial origin were statistically <b>analysed</b> <b>and</b> the results gave statistically significant increase in these organic acids in the adults. There was no statistically significant increase in the children. In conclusion, this study confirmed that grapefruit juice inhibits p-gp in the intestine and this resulted in the presence of unusual organic acids from microbial origin in the urine of the adults. The presence of some of these organic acids have been indicated in some metabolic disorders and are also known to give rise to toxic effects on brain, liver, muscle and other tissues. There is the need to do more study on p-gp expression in children so that its functional roles and effect of the mutation of the gene encoding this protein can be known. Master...|$|R

The exact thrust that the propeller will produce and the thrust that will be lost toe to the viscous forces is, nowadays, known only when the vessel is already built and the test of thrust of the boats, called bollard pull test, is performed. Thanks to the informatics development, the computational fluid dynamics is bringing betler results every day. The importance of numerical simulations in various fields of application is by now widely accepted. There are in particular relevant cases where experiments are too costly, too dangerous or even impossible when the process to be simulated is not even observable in experiments. Therefore computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations it is an economic and reliable way to determinate the boat capacities before its co nstructio n.
