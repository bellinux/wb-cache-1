5000|$|Machias, Maine {{was used}} as a base for privateering against Nova Scotia and as a staging and supply point <b>for</b> American Patriot <b>attacks</b> on Fort Frederick, Saint John and Fort Cumberland. In 1776, privateers from Machias had burned Fort Frederick at Saint John to the ground. In 1777, American forces briefly {{controlled}} Saint John. In response, Major John Small personally led a force to drive out the Americans. When the 84th Regiment landed at Saint John on June 30, 1777, the Americans retreated to the woods. The 84th marched through the woods and were ambushed by the American. Twelve Americans and one member of the regiment were killed. Weeks later, on July 13, 1777, American privateers again attacked Saint John and were repulsed by the 84th. In August 1777, the Americans attacked yet again and were successful, carrying off 21 boatloads of plunder. [...] The 84th immediately began to replace the low-lying Fort Frederick with Fort Howe, which overlooked the settlement. Fort Howe became instrumental in curtailing privateer action and {{was used as}} an <b>assembly</b> point <b>for</b> <b>attacks</b> on the 13 Colonies.|$|R
2500|$|Prisoners {{later said}} that the <b>assembly</b> <b>for</b> the <b>attack</b> had been seen but that the officer in command had ordered the German {{artillery}} to cease-fire just as the British attack began. Possession of The Mounds gave observation over Grandcourt and observation posts were pushed forward over the ridge. Work began on the extension of communication trenches soon after the attack, {{to be ready for}} another advance planned for 19 October. The 39th Division attacked [...] Redoubt at [...] with two battalions of the 118th Brigade and one from the 117th Brigade in support and captured the remaining German positions in the redoubt, in fighting which went on until , as a third 118th Brigade battalion pushed forward on the left. Next day the Germans counter-attacked the redoubt three times, two of the attacks using flame-throwers. On 16 October the 116th Brigade moved from the north bank of the Ancre and took over the redoubt, which was shelled all through 17 October. An attack by II Corps intended for 19 October was postponed because of heavy rain.|$|R
500|$|At 05:45 on 12 July, Leibstandartes {{headquarters}} started receiving {{reports of}} the sound of many tank engines as the Soviet tanks moved into their <b>assembly</b> areas <b>for</b> the <b>attack.</b> At around 06:50, elements of Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment nudged forward and drove the Soviet infantry out of Storozhevoe, while elements of the division's 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment fanned out from the Oktyabrsky State Farm. The Soviet forces began a preparatory artillery barrage at around 08:00, and as the last shells fell at 08:30, Rotmistrov radioed the code words [...] "Stal! Stal! Stal!" [...] ("Steel, Steel, Steel!") – the order to commence the attack. With that the Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army began their advance.|$|R
50|$|If the {{political}} situation so requires, the DA team may operate completely or partially out of proper uniform. In some cases, which international law accepts as a legitimate ruse of war, a direct action force may infiltrate to the target area in disguise, but must make some distinguishing insignia visible before taking any combat actions. While the entire mission was not completed {{due to a lack}} of helicopters, the DA force, in Operation Eagle Claw, which was to make the actual attack on the occupied American Embassy in Tehran, would wear nondescript clothing until they reached the <b>assembly</b> point <b>for</b> the <b>attack.</b> At that time, before using any weapons, they would remove black coverings over American flags, putting them in compliance with having a proper insignia or uniform.|$|R
5|$|Wilder-Neligan was in {{temporary}} command of his battalion during the Second Battle of Bullecourt in May 1917, {{part of the}} Battle of Arras. <b>For</b> the <b>attack</b> on the German trenches known as O.G. 1 and O.G. 2, the 9th Battalion was placed {{under the command of}} the 1st Brigade. Before the <b>attack,</b> he arranged <b>for</b> his men to create dumps of barbed wire, stakes, hand grenades and other equipment and tools near to the battalion <b>assembly</b> point <b>for</b> the <b>attack.</b> He ensured that telephone lines were laid as far forward as possible, then briefed his company commanders and supporting units. Fierce bomb fights occurred in both objective trenches as soon as the 9th Battalion attacked, but the Queenslanders gradually pushed the Germans back. A heavy German barrage then fell on the captured trenches. During the battle, the unit suffered 160 casualties, mainly from bombs. For his actions at Bullecourt, Wilder-Neligan was recommended for the Belgian Order of the Crown, although there is no record of an appointment to the order. For other brief periods {{in the first half of}} 1917 he was acting commanding officer of the 9th Battalion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{capture of}} the redoubt was {{considered}} by some German officers to be a worse blow to morale than the fall of Thiepval. The 28th Reserve Division positions in the Ancre valley were exposed to British ground observation and made Grandcourt a deathtrap. The trenches were demolished and movement had to be from shell-hole to shell-hole; {{it was easy to}} get lost and blunder into British positions. Ludendorff and Rupprecht considered a retirement from the salient that had formed around St Pierre Division and Beaumont Hamel as the Germans had been pushed off the west end of Bazentin Ridge. Below objected because there were no better positions to retire to and preferred to counter-attack to regain Feste Staufen and the positions nearby. In 2005, Prior and Wilson wrote that the attack on the Mounds succeeded because of detailed preparation, the attacking units being fresh, despite the bad weather and resting battalions being used for digging and carrying. The artillery preparation was considered excellent and the <b>assembly</b> <b>for</b> the <b>attack</b> was so well covered by the bombardment, that the attack was a tactical surprise. The infantry were more experienced, keeping close to the creeping barrage and the German artillery-fire was judged to have been feeble. In 2009, Philpott wrote that it had taken the Reserve Army/5th Army more than a month to capture {{the north end of the}} Thiepval Ridge against a reinvigorated German defence. The advance was costly and the front line had been moved barely [...] forward.|$|R

50|$|The 38th entrained at Arras on September 25, {{reaching}} their <b>assembly</b> position <b>for</b> the <b>attack</b> on Cambrai the following day. The battalion was tasked with capturing the railway near Bourlon, and the attack {{began on the}} morning of September 27. The battalion crossed the Canal at Inchy; at the outset the it captured 25 machine guns and 150 prisoners, but by noon there was stiff opposition. Before the day was over the 38th had captured a battery of 5.9 guns, a battery of 77-mm guns, 28 machine guns, 2 anti-tank guns and 200 prisoners. The battalion continued on September 28 to capture positions in Marcoing Trench. At this time Lieut. Col. Gardner, who was in command of the battalion, was killed. The task of the 38th now was to cross the Douai-Cambrai Road; on September 29 the battalion moved forward and that day nearly all the officers and NCOs of the battalion were killed or wounded. The losses may be appreciated by the fact that on September 26 the 38th went into the line 570 strong and came out on September 30 with 96.
