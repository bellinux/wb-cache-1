5|$|The Undiscovered Country was {{released}} on VHS and in widescreen and pan and scan formats on Laserdisc in June 1992; the release <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes of new footage to the film. Because of a trend in supermarket video sales and rentals, Paramount offered rebates for the home video release of The Undiscovered Country through boxes of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats. The Laserdisc version of the film was the tenth highest-selling video during 1992. The home video cut was later released for the film's 1999 DVD debut.|$|E
5|$|Played at Chelmsford {{after the}} semi-final, Vipers' captain Charlotte Edwards won the toss and elected to bowl first. The Western Storm opening batsmen, Stafanie Taylor and Rachel Priest started well, {{propelling}} the score to 71 without loss after ten overs. In the subsequent over, Arran Brindle dismissed Taylor for 35, and her miserly bowling helped {{to slow the}} Storm's scoring. Heather Knight and Priest got out soon after one another, scoring 6 and 57 respectively, before the Storm's middle-order batsmen; Fran Wilson (16*), Lizelle Lee (6), Sophie Luff (2) and Georgia Hennessy (9*), <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more runs to bring their total to 140 from 20 overs. Brindle and Tash Farrant were the pick of the bowlers, both conceding less than five runs per over.|$|E

5|$|At first, Botaneiates lacked {{enough troops}} to oppose Bryennios, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had consolidated his control over his native Thrace, effectively isolating the capital from the remaining imperial territory in the Balkans. Botaneiates sent an embassy under the proedros Constantine Choirosphaktes, a veteran diplomat, to conduct negotiations with Bryennios. At {{the same time he}} appointed the young Alexios Komnenos as his Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief), and sought aid from the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman, who sent 2,000 warriors and promised even more. In his message to Bryennios, the aged Botaneiates (76 years old at his accession) offered him the rank of Caesar and his nomination as heir to the throne. Bryennios agreed in principle, but <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> conditions of his own, and sent the ambassadors back to Constantinople for confirmation. Botaneiates, who likely had initiated negotiations only to gain time, rejected Bryennios's conditions, and ordered Alexios Komnenos to campaign against the rebel.|$|E

25|$|Steamtown National Historic Site {{has since}} sold {{a few pieces}} from the Blount collection, and <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> others deemed of greater {{historical}} significance to the region. By 2008, low visitor attendance and the need of costly asbestos removal from many pieces of the collection were spurring discussion about privatizing Steamtown.|$|E
25|$|Two small lean-to {{wood and}} zinc {{structures}} were <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years ago. The auditorium was adapted to air conditioning features, with acoustic ceiling and related fixtures having been added.

25|$|Tinderbox is {{the seventh}} studio album by English {{alternative}} rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees, released in 1986.

25|$|In 1988, he had {{directed}} {{about two-thirds of}} Zombi 3 in the Philippines before having to return abruptly to Italy due to a second bout of hepatitis. The film was finished by an un-credited Bruno Mattei. Fulci later said that he hated the finished product and tried unsuccessfully to get his name removed from the credits. Mattei has said in interviews that the film was Fulci's, and that he (Mattei) just <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> extra scenes to pad out the running time.|$|E
25|$|The game {{features}} {{many more}} characters, both enemy and otherwise that further delineate {{the story and}} lengthen the quest. The PSP version <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> new characters, including an elderly man named Bly, a woman named Mistel, and an angelic figure referred to simply as #367.

25|$|Along {{with the}} major networks, some media {{conglomerates}} also run second-tier television systems (e.g., Rogers Media's Omni Television and Bell Media's CTV Two). These systems share the same parent companies as most of their local stations, and such stations can be considered O as well. For example, all of CTV Two's local stations are owned by Bell Media. On the other hand, Canwest's E! <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> private affiliates not owned by Canwest in Western Canada prior to its demise in 2009; those affiliates have since joined Rogers' City network.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to expand beyond the talk and court shows that KDFW had based its {{syndicated}} programming slate around since the July 1995 switch, the station <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> off-network sitcoms between the late 1990s and the mid-2000s—such as Seinfeld (which later moved to KDAF), King of the Hill (which later moved to KTXA), 3rd Rock From the Sun and Malcolm in the Middle—mainly {{as part of its}} late-night schedule. After sister station KDFI assumed rights to most of the sitcoms KDFW had previously aired in the 2008-09 season, no off-network comedies aired on KDFW's schedule (a rarity for a Fox station) until September 2013, when the station began airing reruns of Modern Family.|$|E
25|$|So {{infectious}} was {{the interest}} that George Loddiges and fellow nurserymen created {{during the early}} nineteenth century in the splendour of new ferns, trees, palms - indeed plants of all kinds - that he was prompted to begin marketing a series of volumes containing coloured engravings of the many new species and varieties. Entitled The Botanical Cabinet it ran to twenty volumes and 2,000 plates. Facing each plant portrait, George Loddiges <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lines of text outlining the source of the seeds and invariably adding a religious perspective. Many of the drawings for the publications were made by George himself, his daughter Jane and the young Edward Cooke who became a leading Victorian artist, and whose father, George Cooke, engraved a number of the plates.|$|E
25|$|There {{were five}} initial charges lodged against the Templars. The first was {{renunciation}} of and spitting {{on the cross}} during initiation into the Order. The second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel, posterior and mouth. The third was telling the neophyte (novice) that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly. The fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol {{in the form of}} a human head with a great beard, and that this idol was adored in all chapters. The fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating Mass. Subsequently, the charges would be increased and would become, according to the procedures, lists of articles 86 to 127 in which will be <b>added</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other charges, such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order.|$|E
