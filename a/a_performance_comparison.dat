The subjective assessment used the same test methodology and images as those used by the JPEG committee when it evaluated JPEG XR. For 4:2:0 chroma sampled images the average bit rate reduction for HEVC compared to JPEG 2000 was 20.26% for PSNR and 30.96% for MOS while compared to JPEG it was 61.63% for PSNR and 43.10% for MOS.|$|E

It uses cloud {{computing}} capabilities {{to enhance the}} quality of service (QoS) in next generation 5 G networks. The basic concept of Cloud RAN is to separate the digital baseband processing units (BBUs) of conventional cell sites, from the Remote Radio Heads (RRHs), and move them to the cloud for centralized signal processing and management. In this paper, we highlight key technologies and tradeoffs that drive Cloud RAN. We propose a new model of C-RAN architecture which introduces a flexible split of RAN functionalities between an edge cloud, Cloud-RRH, and the central Cloud.
