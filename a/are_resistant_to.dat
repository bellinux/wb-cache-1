Diarrhoeal disease in children is self limiting and can be treated withrehydration and other supportive therapy without antibiotics. The antibiotics are used onlyfor treatment of dysentery, cholera and persistant diarrhoea. In the present study, 275 stool specimens were collected, 180 (65. 5 %) from Muzzamil Abayazid Hospital in Mayo District, Khartoum State and 95 (34. 5 %) from Ibrahim Mallik Teaching Hospital in Elsahafa, Khartoum State during the period from November 2001 to October 2002 from children under five years of age with diarrhoea. After culture in selective and differential media 283 clinical isolates were obtained.

Approximately 60 % (n = 267) <b>were</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> {{one or more}} antimicrobials, and 19 · 6 % (n = 88) <b>were</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> two or more antimicrobials.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to find the prevalence of ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae among K. pneumoniae isolates separated from Egyptian patients with suspected nosocomial infections, to detect their drug resistance pattern and to look for bla SHV and bla CTX-M genes in such organisms. Subjects and methods: 138 K. pneumoniae isolates from Egyptian patients with suspected nosocomial infections were screened for ESBL production by the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibilities. Phenotypic identification for ESBL production was confirmed by double disc synergy test, phenotypic confirmatory double disc test and by MicroScan panel system. bla SHV and bla CTX-M genes in ESBL producing K. pneumoniae were detected using multiplex PCR. Results: The prevalence of ESBL producing K. pneumoniae was 21 % (30 / 138). Their pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility showed that 90 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> (Sulphamethoxazole/Trimethoprim), 70 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> (Amoxicillin/Clavulanate), 63. 3 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> Cefotaxime and Ceftazidime, 60 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> Amikacin, 46. 7 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> Doxycycline, Cefoxitin, Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin, 40 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> Cefepime, 20 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> Ertapenem and (Sulbactam/Cefoperazone), 13. 3 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), 10 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> (Imipenem/Cilastatin) and Gentamycin and 6. 7 % <b>was</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> Meropenem and Ciprofloxacin. Among the ESBL producing K. pneumoniae, three out of 30 (10 %) and 16 out of 30 (53. 3 %) were positive for bla SHV and bla CTX-M genes respectively. It could be concluded that ESBL producing isolates of K. pneumoniae have been increasingly recognized in the hospital settings in Egypt and are associated with multiple drug resistance. Thus, molecular {{identification of}} the genes encoding beta lactamases would be essential for a reliable epidemiological investigation of their transmission in hospitals and antimicrobial resistance...|$|R
