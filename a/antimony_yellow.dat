50|$|Naples yellow, {{also called}} <b>antimony</b> <b>yellow,</b> {{can range from}} a {{somewhat}} muted, or earthy, reddish yellow pigment to a bright light yellow, and is the chemical compound lead(II) antimonate. Its chemical composition is Pb(SbO3)2/Pb3(SbO4)2. It {{is also known as}} jaune d'antimoine. It {{is one of the oldest}} synthetic pigments, dating from around 1620. The related mineral pigment, bindheimite, dates from the 16th century BC. However, this natural version was rarely, if ever, used as a pigment.|$|E
5000|$|Titanium <b>yellow,</b> also nickel <b>antimony</b> {{titanium}} <b>yellow,</b> nickel <b>antimony</b> titanium <b>yellow</b> rutile, CI Pigment Yellow 53, or C.I. 77788, is {{a yellow}} pigment with the chemical composition of NiO·Sb2O3·20TiO2. Its CAS number is [...] It {{is a complex}} inorganic compound. Its melting point lies above 1000 °C, and has extremely low solubility in water. While it contains antimony and nickel, their bioavailability is very low, so the pigment is relatively safe.|$|R
5000|$|Titanium <b>Yellow</b> (nickel <b>antimony</b> {{titanium}} <b>yellow</b> rutile, [...] ) {{is created}} by adding small amounts of the oxides of nickel and antimony to titanium dioxide and heating. It is used to produce yellow paints with good white coverage and has the LBNL paint code [...] "Y10".|$|R
50|$|González Quiñones {{employed}} traditional {{materials and}} kept {{most of the}} traditional methods. However, he produced both traditional and contemporary designs, with the clay coming from the nearby Sierra de Santa Rosa. The artist used both molds and turntables with 95% of his round items having been made on the latter. His colors and designs were relatively conservative, using mineral paints such as copper oxide for green, <b>antimony</b> for <b>yellow</b> and cobalt for blue, all prepared locally.|$|R

5000|$|The fifteenth-century wares that {{initiated}} maiolica as an {{art form}} were the product of an evolution in which medieval lead-glazed earthenwares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily. Such archaic wares are sometimes called [...] "proto-maiolica". During the later fourteenth century, the limited palette of colours was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to include cobalt blue, <b>antimony</b> <b>yellow</b> and iron-oxide orange. Sgraffito wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide glaze was scratched through to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware. Scrap sgraffito ware excavated from kilns in Bacchereto, Montelupo and Florence show that such wares were produced more widely than at Perugia and Città di Castello, the places to which they have been traditionally attributed.|$|E
40|$|The {{compounds}} {{responsible for}} the colours and decorations in glass and glazed ceramics include: colouring agents (transition metal ions), pigments (micro-and nano-precipitates of compounds that either do not dissolve or recrystallize in the glassy matrix) and opacifiers (microcrystalline compounds with high light scattering capability). Their composition, structure and range of stability are highly dependent {{not only on the}} composition but also on the procedures followed to obtain them. Chemical composition of the colorants and crystallites may be obtained by means of SEM-EDX and WDX. Synchrotron Radiation micro-X-ray Diffraction has a small beam size adequate (10 to 50 microns footprint size) to obtain the structural information of crystalline compounds and high brilliance, optimal for determining the crystallites even when present in low amounts. In addition, in glass decorations the crystallites often appear forming thin layers (from 10 to 100 micrometers thick) and they show a depth dependent composition and crystal structure. Their nature and distribution across the glass/glazes decorations gives direct information on the technology of production and stability and {{may be related to the}} color and appearance. A selection of glass and glaze coloring agents and decorations are studied by means of SR-micro- XRD and SEM-EDX including: manganese brown, <b>antimony</b> <b>yellow,</b> red copper lusters and cobalt blue. The selection includes Medieval (Islamic, and Hispano Moresque) and renaissance tin glazed ceramics from the 10 th to the 17 th century AD...|$|E
50|$|The white opaque surface makes {{tin glaze}} a good base for painted {{decoration}}. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly cobalt oxide for blue, copper oxide for green, iron oxide for brown, manganese dioxide for purple-brown and <b>antimony</b> for <b>yellow.</b> Late Italian maiolica blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called istoriato. To these oxides modern potters {{are able to}} add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes fritted. In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and blended colours which were {{not strong enough to}} penetrate the opaque glaze made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.|$|R
50|$|Ancient milk glasses used {{crystals}} {{of calcium}} antimonate, {{formed in the}} melt from calcium present in the glass and an <b>antimony</b> additive. Opaque <b>yellow</b> glasses contained crystals of lead antimonate; bindheimite mineral {{may have been used}} as the additive. Under oxidizing condition, lead also forms incompletely dissolved lead pyroantimonate (Pb2Sb2O7). From 2nd century BC tin oxide appears in use as opacifier, likely in the form of cassiterite mineral. Opaque yellow can be produced as lead stannate; the color is paler than the lead antimonate one. Later calcium and sodium phosphates became used; bone ash contains calcium phosphate in a high proportion. Calcium fluoride was also used, especially in China.|$|R
50|$|The Klein Iser Works {{were left}} in the capable hands of his kinsman Karl Kittel. Kittel retired in 1853 and was {{replaced}} by Johann Bengler, a bookkeeper from Christiansthal, who headed up the works for nearly forty years. Begler invented a number of coloured glass types including jet black, lily <b>yellow,</b> <b>antimony</b> ruby, marble-like variations, and the Venetian aventurine. He was awarded the Empire’s Golden Service Cross as a tribute to his glassmaking skills. In the early 1850s two long ‘pulling rooms’ were added to the glassworks. These were used to stretch glass to make tubes for the six faceted cut and polished seed beads then in demand.|$|R
40|$|By {{courtesy}} of the Director of 's Rijks Museum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, I have received a number of eastern Lymantriidae for determination. From among these, four species from N. Celebes and one from W. Java are hereinafter described as new. RIDGWAY'S Color Standards and Color Nomenclature 1912 has been employed in the colour descriptions and the Comstock-Needham system for the wing neuration. 1. Porthesia argyrochila sp. nov. ♀. Palpus pale orange yellow. Antenna tawny olive. Head and thorax warm buff to light orange yellow. Abdomen drab above and beneath, anal tuft pale orange yellow. Pectus and legs pinkish buff, mixed on tibia and tarsus of foreleg and tibia of middle leg with light orange yellow. Forewing warm buff, grading to <b>antimony</b> <b>yellow</b> along the costa and in the terminal area; the whole wing except along the costa and in the terminal area irrorated thickly with bistre; a preterminal fascia, continued round the tornus and along the inner margin to one-half, broken at the veins, dark in some lights and giving in others a metallic silvery reflection; fringe warm buff. Hindwing drab, somewhat lighter along the termen; fringe light buff. Underside of both wings, and fringes, drab to tawny olive. Expanse: ♀♀ 30 — 34 mm. 1 ♀ (holotype) and 1 ♀ (paratype) Goeroepahi, N. Celebes, July 1917, W. KAUDERN. Also, in the British Museum ex Oberthür collection, 1 ♀ taken between Maros and Tjamba, S. W.

40|$|The work {{is focused}} on {{identification}} of lead tin yellow types I and II, Naples yellow, and also on discrimination of a less common, distinct yellow pigment, the ternary Pb-Sb-Sn oxide. The knowledge about all those Pb-based yellows was in fact forgotten after introduction of modern synthetic yellows in 19 th century. As late as {{in the last decade}} of the 20 th century, the existence of Pb-Sb-Sn yellow and its production have been rediscovered, and only then it has been identified in colour layer of artworks. Pb-Sb-Sn yellow has recently been identified in colour layer of 17 th century Italian paintings by Sandalinas and Ruiz-Moreno [C. Sandalinas, S. Ruiz-Moreno, Lead tin-antimony yellow, historical manufacture, molecular characterization and identification in seventeenth-century Italian paintings, Stud. Conserv. 49 (2003) 41 e 52], and here we report the finding of this pigment in Mid-European painting of the 18 th and 19 th cen-turies. Lead tin yellows, lead <b>antimony</b> <b>yellow</b> (Naples yellow), and lead antimony tin yellow were synthesized in laboratory following historical recipes, their colour was analyzed, and their structure was confirmed to provide a basis for their routine identification in microsamples of art-works by X-ray microdiffraction. Unequivocal identification of Pb-based yellows could help in authentication of traditional European paintings, because their use was temporally and also geographically specific. Combination of elemental microanalysis (X-ray fluorescence electron micro-analysis) and X-ray powder microdiffraction were found very efficient in the microanalysis of colour layers of artworks with Pb-based yellow...|$|E
