5|$|In Costa Rica, 28people were killed, 75were injured, and 18were missing. Rainfall caused 20rivers {{to burst}} their banks, {{flooding}} 75settlements, including {{the city of}} Quepos, Costa Rica on the Pacific coast. At Ciudad Neily, Costa Rica, the Rio Corredores broke through <b>a</b> <b>dike.</b> In total, 7,500Costa Ricans were rendered homeless. Damages in Costa Rica amounted to $65million.|$|E
5|$|In January1929, Fred C. Elliott {{explained}} {{during a}} Congressional hearing that because no state funds were available and state law {{did not allow}} {{for the construction of}} <b>a</b> <b>dike,</b> Congress was petitioned for funding and authorization. Bror G. Dahlberg, Congressmen Herbert J. Drane and William J. Sears of Florida's 1st and 4th congressional districts respectively, Fred Henry Davis, former Congressman Walter F. Lineberger from California, and U.S. Senator Park Trammell of Florida also testified. Drane stated that he had attempted since 1924 to bring about flood control. After President Herbert Hoover's visit to the area in February 1929, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. Congress approved the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930, signed into law by President Hoover on July3, 1930.|$|E
5|$|Severe hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 caused catastrophic {{damage and}} {{flooding}} from Lake Okeechobee {{that prompted the}} Army Corps of Engineers to build <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after World War II, {{and the creation of}} the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to Everglades National Park, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades.|$|E

50|$|Opperdoes used to {{be located}} 4 or 5 {{kilometres}} from the sea-dike that existed around 781. However, the <b>dike</b> was in <b>a</b> very bad condition and in 1318 Willem van Henegouwen, the ruler, agreed the build <b>a</b> new <b>dike.</b> In 1334 <b>a</b> new <b>dike</b> was built between Medemblik and Barsingerhorn.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands, a dike-ring is {{the area}} of land that is {{protected}} from flooding by <b>an</b> individual <b>dike.</b> <b>As</b> the Netherlands are constantly at risk from floods, the entire nation has been subdivided into dike-ring areas.|$|R
5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{flood in}} 1959 {{led to the}} {{construction}} of <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> along the Little Miami River in 1962–1963.|$|E

25|$|The dam {{will consist}} of <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> of 220 feet high by 1,230 feet wide. It will use 368,000 cubic yards of {{compressed}} concrete. As of 22 March 2009, 88 percent of the concrete work had been completed. Its scheduled completion date is 2013. The total investment is $375 million USD.|$|E
25|$|By 1925, {{the market}} {{ran out of}} buyers to pay the high prices, and soon the boom became a bust. The 1926 Miami Hurricane, which nearly {{destroyed}} the city further depressed the real estate market. In 1928 another hurricane struck Southern Florida. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane made landfall near Palm Beach, severely damaging the local infrastructure. In townships near Lake Okeechobee, the storm breached <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> separating the water from land, creating a storm surge that killed over 2,000 people and destroying the towns of Belle Glade and Pahokee.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} form a sea cave, the host rock must first contain a weak zone. In {{metamorphic}} or igneous rock, this is typically either a fault as in the caves of the Channel Islands of California, or <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> as in the large sea caves of Kauai, Hawaii’s Na Pali Coast. In sedimentary rocks, {{this may be a}} bedding-plane parting or a contact between layers of different hardness. The latter may also occur in igneous rocks, such as in the caves on Santa Cruz Island, California, where waves have attacked the contact between the andesitic basalt and the agglomerate.|$|E

50|$|The {{next step}} was to move the dikes ever-more seawards. Every cycle of high and low tide left a small layer of sediment. Over the years these layers had built up to such a height that they were rarely flooded. It was then {{considered}} safe to build <b>a</b> new <b>dike</b> around this area. The old dike was often kept as a secondary defense, called <b>a</b> sleeper <b>dike.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{southern}} {{coastal areas}} were originally amphibious flood plains and swampy land. In areas {{especially vulnerable to}} storm surges, people settled behind elevated levees and on natural areas of high ground such as spits and geestland. As early as 500 BC, people were constructing artificial dwelling hills higher than the prevailing flood levels. It was only around {{the beginning of the}} High Middle Ages, in 1200 AD, that inhabitants began to connect single ring dikes into <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> line along the entire coast, thereby turning amphibious regions between the land and the sea into permanent solid ground.|$|E

Mrs. Brinker, Hans, and Gretel must all work to support the family and are looked down upon in the {{community}} because of their low income and poor status. Hans has a chance meeting with the famous surgeon Dr. Boekman and begs him to treat their father, but the doctor is expensive and gruff in nature following {{the loss of his}} wife and disappearance of his son. Eventually, Dr. Boekman is persuaded to examine the Brinkers' father. He diagnoses pressure on the brain, which can be cured by a risky and expensive operation involving trephining.|$|E
25|$|In a {{proposal}} to the Port of Portland, the west channel of the Willamette River next to Swan Island {{would have to be}} widened, and <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> built to keep high water out. The project extended its timeline in May 1926, forcing the USPS to keep using Pearson Airfield in Vancouver to deliver mail to the city. Most of the accommodations for the USPS at Swan Island Municipal Airport opened in September 1926, but commercial services were still being readied. The airfield only took-up a fraction of the land on Swan Island. The other areas were cleared and leveled so industrial growth could take place. During its construction, the Port of Portland requested that the Swan Island Municipal Airport be the future site of the Pacific Coast Air Derby, which was approved.|$|E

This area, administered for the benefit of wildlife and people, was known as Tinicum Wildlife Preserve. [...] The areas of open water along with the adjacent heavily vegetated tidal wetlands, formed an ideal habitat for thousands of migratory waterfowl.|$|R

25|$|Artwork, {{exterior}} details, landscaping, {{and other}} {{finishing touches on}} the construction of Federal Triangle occupied the period from 1938 to 1947. Landscaping issues of the Grand Plaza and Circular Plaza were considered in January 1934. To protect the Federal Triangle from flooding by the Potomac River (as had happened in 1871), the north and west grounds of the Washington Monument were raised in the summer of 1938 by about six feet (two metres) in order to form <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> against any future floodwaters. The final art installation in the complex was the Oscar Straus Memorial Fountain, designs for which were first considered in December 1933. Plans for the memorial were brought before President Roosevelt for his approval the same month. Discussion continued into 1934. The Federal Triangle project was considered complete with the installation of the Straus Memorial in 1947.|$|E
25|$|In 1629 {{the city}} {{suffered}} its worse flooding in recorded history. The Río Aculhuacán broke through its dikes, flooding {{the entire city}} from 1 to 2 meters deep. Transportation was by canoe, and many families left the city permanently. The rains continued, and the flood waters did not recede. Probably 30,000 persons died, and it was feared that the capital might disappear completely. Parts of the city remained flooded for four years. On May 19, 1630, the viceroy ordered the capital moved to Tacubaya, nearby but on higher ground, pending an open discussion in the guilds of the city. The guilds were opposed, resolving instead to restart the engineering works. By {{the end of the}} year, the engineer Enrico Martínez had restarted the work. By 1632 the Huehuetoca canal had finally been completed and the Calzada de San Cristóbal, atop a wall surrounding the city that served as <b>a</b> <b>dike,</b> had been renovated.|$|E
25|$|The {{watershed}} includes School Section Lakes, Goggins Lake, Long Lake and Benz Lake. Brown's Creek {{flows through}} the Brown's Creek Park and Nature Preserve northwest of Stillwater, then proceeds east to it confluence with the St. Croix River. At one time in its history, Brown’s Creek was diverted into McKusick Lake, which supplied water to Stillwater residents. By 1955 fisheries managers recognized that warm lake water was putting a strain on the trout population in Brown’s Creek. In {{an effort to reduce}} water temperatures for the benefit of trout, <b>a</b> <b>dike</b> was constructed to separate the stream from the lake and return the flow back to Brown’s Creek. The dike still exists today. In 1999, Browns Creek underwent a re-route in the fall of 1999 that shortened this section of the stream from 5,130 feet to 2,000 feet in order to lower water temperatures by avoiding water warming in previous meander through a wetland just north of Lake McKusick, increasing stream velocity and decreasing organic matter in the stream. This project by the city of Stillwater and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources also restored natural riparian vegetation as the creek traverses the Oak Glen Golf Course.|$|E

25|$|The third column, with Generals Pulteney, Don and Coote, {{likewise}} {{found the}} terrain difficult. This column {{was forced to}} use the road on <b>a</b> <b>dike,</b> called the Langedijk (long dike) that divides several polders. This dike was flanked on the right hand by a deep drainage canal, {{and on the other}} side the many ditches in the land also hindered easy deployment. The road led to the village of Oudkarspel where the 1st Batavian division of General Daendels had built some fieldworks (the Dutch complained that Brune had prohibited the full development of fortifications, which made the defence more difficult). The first attack on this strongpoint by Pulteney ended in disaster with the British fleeing in panic until they could be rallied behind another dike that gave some cover against the Dutch artillery fire. Several other British frontal attacks were also repulsed with great loss, and an encircling movement proved impracticable due to the canal. General Daendels made the mistake of ordering an under-strength sally from his redoubt by 100 grenadiers. Not only was this easily repulsed, but the rout of the grenadiers enabled the pursuing British, following hot on their heels, to penetrate the Dutch entrenchments and rout the entire group of defenders. This rout could only be stopped at the end of the Langedijk. The retreating troops suffered very heavy losses due to British artillery fire. Daendels finally personally led a counter-attack with only one battalion of grenadiers, but by then the debacle on the British right wing had been communicated to Pulteney, who therefore was already withdrawing to his starting position. The British therefore made no net territorial gains, but they had dealt the Batavians heavy losses in casualties and prisoners.|$|E
