5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee {{many years to come}} to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} criticized as too militaristic.

5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance. <b>Accepted</b> <b>in</b> the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a closeted homosexual, Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl, and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> the Dance department, despite having {{no interest in the}} subject. Coco Hernandez is <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing as part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by his talents than hers.|$|E
5|$|In a 1905 paper, Einstein {{postulated}} that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta).

Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E

However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective Regional Development Agencies and a new system of Local authority leaders' boards.|$|E

30|$|It is {{relevant}} {{at this point}} to recall that different measures of the equivalents between money and another attribute can be defined according to whether a loss or a gain is incurred. The theory of reference-dependent preferences, which applies the ideas of prospect theory to riskless choice, define four valuation measures (found in Bateman et al. [3] and in Munro and Sugden [20]): willingness to pay (money one would pay in return for a given gain in the attribute), willingness to accept (money one would <b>accept</b> <b>in</b> return for a given loss in the attribute), equivalent loss (money loss one would <b>accept</b> <b>in</b> place of a given loss in the attribute), and equivalent gain (money gain one would <b>accept</b> <b>in</b> place of a given gain in the attribute). A central assumption in the theory is loss aversion: losses are valued more heavily than gains. This implies that the four valuation measures need to be different and satisfy certain inequalities.|$|R

5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.|$|E
5|$|Based on his {{participation}} in the debate and his reputation, Hoffmann received the commission to design the new building. Without any kind of competitive bidding or restrictions, he was commissioned to design it with space for approximately 1,000 employees. In 1900, the prosperous city decided the building should feature a tower. Hoffmann's design was <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 1901, and demolition of the existing buildings began. The cornerstone was laid in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press. In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the Society. Those articles were often sensationalist and served to put the Society in a bad light. The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E

In 1970 he received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class.

5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always <b>accepted.</b> <b>In</b> some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome of brainstem death. Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
