5|$|Asser is {{sometimes}} cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, {{which is now}} known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire Life is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> lighting.|$|E

5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. What this means is addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Procopius {{provides}} {{the primary source}} {{for the history of}} Justinian's reign. The Syriac chronicle of John of Ephesus, which does not survive, was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> later chronicles, contributing many additional details of value. Both historians became very bitter towards Justinian and his empress, Theodora. Other sources include the histories of Agathias, Menander Protector, John Malalas, the Paschal Chronicle, the chronicles of Marcellinus Comes and Victor of Tunnuna. Justinian is widely regarded as a saint by Orthodox Christians, and is also commemorated by some Lutheran churches on 14 November.|$|E
5|$|The moors {{had been}} used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> {{domestic}} fuel, {{in the form of}} peat, since at least the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and probably as early as the Roman or pre-Roman periods. In the early 1800s, peat was still being formed: William Harrison reported that a short time after moving to Thorne, a rise in the surface of the moors has obscured Crowle Church, previously visible from his home.|$|E

A photograph by Cecil Beaton in which Elizabeth wears the red Order of the British Empire robes has been considered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> the portrait.|$|E
5|$|WWV {{had been}} {{broadcasting}} second pulses since 1937, but these pulses were {{not tied to}} actual time. In June 1944, the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO's clock <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> its time signals. Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Frequencies of 600Hz and 440Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35MHz. The 30 and 35MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953.|$|E

Another source of germanium is fly ash of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium. Russia and China used this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> germanium. Russia's deposits are located in the far east of Sakhalin Island, and northeast of Vladivostok. The deposits in China are located mainly in the lignite mines near Lincang, Yunnan; coal is also mined near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia.|$|E

5|$|Bede {{also had}} correspondents who {{supplied}} him with material. Albinus, the abbot {{of the monastery}} in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and {{with the assistance of}} Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great's correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the Historia Ecclesiastica; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information {{about the history of the}} church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As {{a result of this}} work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> {{what they thought was}} gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a {{study of}} American {{television}} viewers and found that fans of The Daily Show had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign {{survey conducted by the}} Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as The Daily Show <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds while those who cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.|$|E
5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū from ca. 1120 is {{the most}} {{important}} setsuwa compilation. It is an anonymous collection of more than 1,000 anecdotes or tales. About two-thirds of the tales are Buddhist, telling about the spread of Buddhism from India via China to Japan. As such it is the first world history of Buddhism written in Japanese. This National Treasure is also known as the Suzuka Manuscript and consists of nine volumes covering setsuwa from India (vols. 2 and 5), China (vols. 7, 9, 10) and Japan (vols. 12, 17, 27, 29). It is considered to be the oldest extant manuscript of the Konjaku Monogatarishū and has served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> various later manuscripts.|$|E
