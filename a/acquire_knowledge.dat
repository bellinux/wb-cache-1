Al-ShÉfi‘Ê contributed much to this field with his classification of knowledge into two categories, ‘ilm al-‘Émmah and ‘ilm al-khÉÎÎah. Al-GhazÉlÊ, who developed ‘ilm al-mu‘Émalah and al-mukÉshafah, suggested a method of revivification (iÍyÉ’) in order to integrate the sciences of <b>acquired</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Al-DihlawÊ developed and classified knowledge into ‘ilm al-ÍuÌËrÊ and al-ÍuÎËlÊ, and suggested the concept of taÏbÊq in reforming <b>acquired</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Their discussions on the reformation of <b>acquired</b> <b>knowledge</b> have paved the way for modern scholars to derive concepts for the integration of human knowledge...|$|R

25|$|Developmental psychology, and {{especially}} the psychology of cognitive development, opens a special perspective for educational psychology. This is so because education and the psychology of cognitive development converge {{on a number of}} crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. Education aims to help students <b>acquire</b> <b>knowledge</b> and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding and problem-solving capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and level of knowledge they can assimilate, which, in turn, {{can be used as a}} frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why Piaget's theory of cognitive development was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education. In the same direction, the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and working memory capacities that characterize successive age levels.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the Spanish Conquest in {{the early}} 16th century, the native peoples of Mesoamerica {{maintained}} several literary genres.

2500|$|During the Middle Ages Aristotle's {{theory of}} tabula rasa was {{developed}} by Islamic philosophers starting with Al Farabi, developing into an elaborate theory by Avicenna and demonstrated as a thought experiment by Ibn Tufail. For Avicenna (Ibn Sina), for example, the tabula rasa is a pure potentiality that is actualized through education, and knowledge is attained through [...] "empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" [...] developed through a [...] "syllogistic method of reasoning in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts". The intellect itself develops from a material intellect (al-'aql al-hayulani), which is a potentiality [...] "that can <b>acquire</b> <b>knowledge</b> to the active intellect (al-'aql al-fa'il), {{the state of the}} human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge". So the immaterial [...] "active intellect", separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.|$|E

He says, [...] "no man can see God without purity and that no man can know God without becoming a sinner. Dostoevsky tried to reproduce this concept in his art. In Stages on Life's Way, published the next day, he used David and Solomon as examples of those prototypes who did become pure in God's sight by becoming sinners. [...] "While David lay upon the ground with crushed and contrite heart, Solomon arose from his couch, but his understanding was crushed. Horror seized him when he thought {{of what it was}} to be God’s elect. He surmised that holy intimacy with God, the sincerity of the pure man before the Lord, was not the explanation, but that a private guilt was the secret which explained everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Youth {{empowerment}} examines six interdependent dimensions: psychological, community, organizational, economic, {{social and}} cultural. [...] Psychological empowerment enhances individual's consciousness, belief in self-efficacy, awareness {{and knowledge of}} problems and solutions and of how individuals can address problems that harm their quality of life. This dimension aims to create self-confidence and give youth the skills to <b>acquire</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Community empowerment focuses on enhancing the community through leadership development, improving communication, and creating a network of support to mobilize the community to address concerns. Organizational empowerment aims to create a base of resources for a community, including voluntary organizations, unions and association that aim to protect, promote and advocate for the powerless. Economic empowerment teaches entrepreneurial skills, how to take ownership of their assets and how to have income security. Social empowerment teaches youth about social inclusion and literacy as well as helping kids find the resources to be proactive in their communities. Cultural empowerment aims to recreate cultural practices and redefine cultural rules and norms for youth. Through these dimensions of empowerment, programs can work on empowering youth {{in one or more}} aspects of their lives.|$|E

2500|$|Psychometricians {{generally}} regard IQ {{tests as}} having high statistical reliability. A high reliability implies that – although test-takers may have varying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions, {{and although they}} may have varying scores when taking different IQ tests at the same age – the scores generally agree {{with one another and}} across time. Like all statistical quantities, any particular estimate of IQ has an associated standard error that measures uncertainty about the estimate. For modern tests, the standard error of measurement is about three points. Clinical psychologists generally regard IQ scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes. In a survey of 661 randomly sampled psychologists and educational researchers, published in 1988, Mark Snyderman and Stanley Rothman reported a general consensus supporting the validity of IQ testing. [...] "On the whole, scholars with any expertise in the area of intelligence and intelligence testing (defined very broadly) share a common view of the most important components of intelligence, and are convinced that it can be measured with some degree of accuracy." [...] Almost all respondents picked out abstract reasoning, ability to solve problems and ability to <b>acquire</b> <b>knowledge</b> as the most important elements.|$|E
2500|$|Piaget {{attributed}} {{different types}} of psychosocial processes to different forms of social relationships, introducing a fundamental distinction between {{different types of}} said relationships. Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is asymmetrical, and, importantly, the knowledge that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form. Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission, illustrating it through reference {{to the way in}} which the elders of a tribe initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group. Similarly, where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child, it is through social transmission that children can <b>acquire</b> <b>knowledge.</b> By contrast, in cooperative relations, power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more symmetrical relationship emerges. Under these conditions, authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible; each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts, consider the positions of others, and defend his or her own point of view. In such circumstances, where children’s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence, Piaget believed [...] "the reconstruction of knowledge", or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems, exists. Here the knowledge that emerges is open, flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Judah expounded {{the words}} of [...] "Attend and hear, O Israel: This day you have become a people unto the Lord your God."

Rabbi Judah explained that the words [...] "this day" [...] served to teach that every day the Torah is as beloved to those who study it as on the day when God gave it at Mount Sinai. The Gemara explained that the word [...] "attend" [...] ( [...] , hasket) in [...] teaches that students should form groups (aso kitot) to study the Torah, as one can <b>acquire</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the Torah only in association with others, and this is in accord with what Rabbi Jose ben Hanina said when he interpreted {{the words of}} [...] "A sword is upon the boasters ( [...] , baddim) and they shall become fools," [...] to mean that a sword is upon the scholars who sit separately (bad bebad) to study the Torah. The Gemara offered another explanation of the word [...] "attend" [...] ( [...] , hasket) in [...] to mean, [...] "be silent" [...] (has) listening to the lesson, and then [...] "analyze" [...] (katet), as Rava taught that a person should always first learn Torah, and then scrutinize it.|$|E
