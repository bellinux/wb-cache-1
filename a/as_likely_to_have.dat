5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola {{where his father}} had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long {{been the target of}} similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.|$|E
25|$|Only four {{possible}} coalitions {{were seen}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a majority after the election: SPÖ–ÖVP, ÖVP–FPÖ–BZÖ, SPÖ–GRÜNE–BZÖ and SPÖ–FPÖ–BZÖ; {{all but a}} new grand coalition were seen as unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who have}} already had a {{fracture}} are at least twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> another fracture compared to someone {{of the same age}} and sex. Early menopause/hysterectomy is another predisposing factor.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} herpes zoster (HZ) are poorly defined. An age-matched, case-control study was {{conducted}} to assess the effect of physical trauma on HZ, using Medicare data. HZ cases were 3. 4 times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> controls <b>to</b> <b>have</b> experienced trauma in the week before HZ onset, but the magnitude of the association between trauma and HZ declined over time. Cases who had cranial HZ were> 25 times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> con-trols <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had cranial trauma in the week before HZ onset. Therefore, recent trauma can be a trigger for HZ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a {{sanguine}} temperament. In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda, redheads are seen <b>as</b> most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a Pitta temperament.|$|R
25|$|People with {{vaginismus}} {{are twice}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a history of}} childhood sexual interference and held less positive attitudes about their sexuality, whereas no correlation was noted for lack of sexual knowledge or (non-sexual) physical abuse.|$|E
25|$|Preterm birth. Low {{birth weight}} and preterm birth are {{strongly}} associated with many health problems, such as visual impairment and cerebral palsy, and children born after IVF are roughly twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> cerebral palsy.|$|E
25|$|Translocation Down {{syndrome}} {{is often referred}} to as familial Down syndrome. It is the cause of about 4.5% of the observed Down syndromes. It does not show the maternal age effect, and is just <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come from fathers as mothers.|$|E
50|$|Males {{are twice}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> females <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this characteristic, and {{it tends to}} run in {{families}}. In its non-symptomatic form, it is more common among Asians and Native Americans than among other populations, and in some families {{there is a tendency}} to inherit the condition unilaterally, that is, on one hand only.|$|R
50|$|Youth who {{reported}} {{having sex with}} {{both males and females}} are at the greatest risk for disordered eating, unhealthy weight control practices compared to youth who only have same- or other-gender sex. Bisexual women are twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> lesbians <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an eating disorder and, if they are out, <b>to</b> be twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> heterosexual women <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an eating disorder.|$|R
5000|$|Vennemann's {{theories}} on [...] "Vasconic" [...] toponymy and hydronymy were opposed by linguists such as P. R. Kitson (1996), and Baldi & Richard (2006), who {{pointed out that}} most linguists see unusual European hydronyms <b>as</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Indo-European roots of some kind.|$|R
25|$|The {{expedition}} later {{visited the}} Province of Quigate, the Province of Coligua and Palisema. The chief of Palisema sent the expedition {{on to the}} land of the Cayas, where they found the town of Tanico. Linguistic analysis in the 1930s by John Swanton and in the 1980s by Robert L. Rankin point to the Koroa tribe <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the Coligua.|$|E
25|$|The {{data show}} that the Kohanim were {{more than twice as}} likely to belong to Haplogroup J than the average non-Cohen Jew. Of those who did belong to Haplogroup J, the Kohanim were more than twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an STR pattern close to the CMH-6, {{suggesting}} a much more recent common ancestry for most of them compared to an average non-Kohen Jew of Haplogroup J.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the rise in abstinence-only {{education}} remains a question. To date, no published studies of abstinence-only programs have found consistent and significant program effects on delaying the onset of intercourse. In 2007, a study ordered by the U.S. Congress found that middle school students {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were just <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex (and use contraception) in their teenage years as those who did not. Abstinence-only advocates claimed that the study was flawed because it was too narrow and began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and that other studies have demonstrated positive effects.|$|E
50|$|Cousins {{attempted}} {{to differentiate between}} similar approaches, e.g. collaborative, participatory, and empowerment evaluation. Cousins asked whether EE is practical (focusing on decision making), or transformative (focusing on self-determination) and viewed self-evaluation <b>as</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a self-serving bias. This critic noted the variability in attempts at empowerment evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Trachoma {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Chlamydia trachomatis, which spreads through contact with an infected person. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections make the eyelashes turn inward, scratching the cornea. This causes excruciating pain. Although children are the most susceptible to infection, the effects are often not felt until adulthood. Women, traditionally the caretakers of the home, are twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the advanced stage of the disease, called trichiasis.|$|R
5000|$|... found {{subjects}} were more lenient when sentencing attractive individuals than unattractive ones, even though {{exactly the same}} crime was committed. The researchers attributed the result to a societal perception that people {{with a high level}} of attractiveness are seen <b>as</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> successful futures due to corresponding socially desirable traits.|$|R
25|$|A place cell {{is a type}} of {{pyramidal}} neuron within the hippocampus that becomes active when an animal enters a particular place in its environment; this place is known as the place field. A given place cell will have only one, or a few, place fields in a typical small laboratory environment, but more in a larger region. There is no apparent topography to the pattern of place fields, unlike other brain areas such as visual cortex—neighboring place cells are <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> nearby fields as distant ones. In a different environment, typically about half the place cells will still have place fields, but these will be in new places unrelated to their former locations.|$|E
25|$|On September 27, 1996 Karyn left work at 5 p.m. {{with the}} intent to pick up her son Christopher and then shop for a dress at the Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth, Illinois. Later that night a black Pontiac Bonneville was {{discovered}} in central Illinois on westbound I-72 with its engine still running, its headlights on, and the driver's side door open. The car was reported to be registered to David Swann, Karyn's boyfriend, but contained some of Karyn's personal effects including her purse and driver's license. Swann reported her as a missing persons and a search campaign was conducted. At this time it was theorized that Karyn could have been the victim of a car-jacking, as investigators did not view her <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> voluntarily left the area due to her recently signing with a modeling agency for a job.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a study {{ordered by}} Congress found that middle school {{students}} {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were just <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex in their teenage years as those who did not. From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers of the same age; moreover, they had sex {{for the first time at}} about the same age as other students. The study also found that students who took part in the abstinence-only programs were just as likely to use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate. Abstinence-only education advocates claim the study was too narrow, began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and ignored other studies that have shown positive effects.|$|E

500|$|The {{most common}} causes of TBI in the U.S. include violence, {{transportation}} accidents, construction, and sports. Motor bikes are major causes, increasing in significance {{in developing countries}} as other causes reduce. The estimates that between 1.6 and 3.8million traumatic brain injuries each year {{are a result of}} sports and recreation activities in the US. In children aged two to four, falls are {{the most common cause of}} TBI, while in older children traffic accidents compete with falls for this position. TBI is the third most common injury to result from child abuse. Abuse causes 19% of cases of pediatric brain trauma, and the death rate is higher among these cases. Although men are twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a TBI. Domestic violence is another cause of TBI, as are work-related and industrial accidents. Firearms and blast injuries from explosions are other causes of TBI, which is the leading cause of death and disability in war zones. According to Representative Bill Pascrell (Democrat, NJ), TBI is [...] "the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan." ...|$|E
500|$|B. verticillata {{plants are}} {{generally}} killed by fire and regenerate from seed. A field study after a mild fire in Torndirrup National Park published in 1994 found that plants burnt by fire were ten times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seedlings come up under their crown as unburnt plants (with {{an average of}} 25.2 seedlings per burnt plant), and burnt spikes released {{double the number of}} seeds as unburnt spikes. Despite this, interfire recruitment (seedlings arising between fires) has also been recorded, and might be more common than in other Banksia species. Observations at several of the populations showed many plants produced their first seed anywhere from 13 to 17 years of age, leading to a recommendation of 20 years between fires to allow seed banks to accumulate. [...] If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause a population decline or even local extinction. Too long a time between fires also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, the Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames {{argued that}} the {{programme}} would contribute little to the subject: [...] "We do {{need to have a}} rational, informed debate about how to improve our welfare system, but the editorial line taken by supposedly factual ‘reality TV’ adds very little to that." [...] The programme was condemned by the current Ladywood MP, Labour's Shabana Mahmood: [...] "I found it shocking that Channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment. It was profoundly wrong." [...] In the Radio Times, Clare Short, who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood, said the series was [...] "totally unrepresentative" [...] of the area, and condemned it as [...] "crummy and misleading". Others have also criticised Benefits Street, arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject. Labour MP Anne Begg, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, said that the programme was a [...] "misrepresentation" [...] of people claiming benefits, arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of the overall welfare bill. Referring to the first episode that featured a shoplifter, Chris Williamson (also a Labour MP) said it was [...] "irresponsible" [...] to portray him as a typical benefits claimant. Owen Jones, a columnist for The Independent, described the series as [...] "medieval stocks updated for a modern format". In an article for the Birmingham Mail, writer and television personality Samantha Brick, a native of Birmingham, said that the series was an [...] "atrociously unbalanced" [...] view of the city. Shadow Welfare Minister Chris Bryant claimed that the residents of The Bishop's Avenue in Hampsteadknown as Billionaire's Row because of its expensive propertieswere <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> drink and drugs problems as the residents of James Turner Street.|$|E

40|$|Social {{support has}} been {{identified}} as a key predictor of psychological morbidity following adverse life-events. However, the majority of the research has focused exclusively on women, despite evidence of significant gender difference in the utilisation and role of social support.
