25|$|From 1995 to August1997, the Nevada State Railroad Museum {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{of whether the}} McKeen could be restored to working order. The study found {{that most of the}} historic material needed could be salvaged or replicated, {{with the exception of the}} engine, transmission and <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
500|$|The North Mountain House {{was long}} {{known for its}} rustic charms; it was heated with open fireplaces, {{decorated}} with animal skins and hatracks made of antlers, and had two live black bears on chains in the field {{across the road from}} the house. In 1895 and 1900 the stone house was refurbished, and telephone service, <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting,</b> and steam heat were added. In 1900 The Sullivan Review newspaper recalled its former state and wrote of the changes: [...] "We hardly call that an improvement. ... When the North Mountain House is lighted by gas, heated by a modern furnace, etc., its great charm is gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{lighthouse}} {{was constructed}} in 1895 {{and for a while}} served as the rear light in the range. It had a , timber framed corrugated galvanized iron clad tower, with a lantern and a balcony. The original optical apparatus was a 4th order fixed lens with kerosene wick burner. In 1930 the light was converted to <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting,</b> with sun valve and flasher. By 1977 the original lens had been removed and a solar powered Tideland ML-300 electric beacon installed. [...] A pilot station was established on the foreshore nearby in 1919, and closed in 1963.|$|E

50|$|The last {{lighthouse}} keeper was Evard Jansen. He remained {{until the}} light was automated in 1927.The original light was replaced with an automated, <b>acetylene</b> <b>light</b> on a skeleton tower. It was deactivated in 1963.|$|R
50|$|The {{two seat}} body was built {{in-house}} from aluminium over a wood frame and supplied with a folding hood (top) and one piece windscreen. Although the first cars featured <b>acetylene</b> <b>lights,</b> a dynamo lighting set {{was provided by}} 1921.|$|R
2500|$|Planning for the Star car {{began in}} 1897 {{when the company}} {{acquired}} a 3.5hp Benz car and used it {{as the basis for}} the design of their own car. The early vehicles were heavily influenced by existing car makers and the 1898 3.5 was essentially a single-cylinder 3.5hp Benz and often called the Star-Benz; it had two speeds, chain drive, wire spoke wheels, <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting,</b> electric ignition, and Clipper pneumatic tires standard, for ₤189. Star then purchased the rights to produce Star-Benz cars in Wolverhampton and began production at the Stewart Street Works. [...] The cars were now being sold under the Star Motor Company name, a registered subsidiary of Star Engineering Limited, who adopted a policy of building as much as possible in-house. The Star-Benz model sold well and around 250 were made. The cars initially sold for £189 but in 1900 they were selling for £168 and the company was producing 20 a week.|$|E
50|$|Dalen's {{system of}} <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> for marine {{navigation}} proved very reliable, {{as exemplified by}} the lighthouse at Chumbe Island off Zanzibar. This lighthouse was constructed in 1904 and converted to un-manned automatic acetylene gas operation in 1926. The <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> installation, controlled by a sun valve, remained in use until the lighthouse was converted to a solar-powered (photovoltaic) system in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The first Xtra was {{a single}} seater (monocar) with a light plywood on ash frame body with an {{occasional}} seat behind the driver {{on top of the}} engine. It featured <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting.</b> A top speed of above 30 mph (48 km/h) was claimed.|$|E
50|$|In 1915 {{the light}} source and the {{generator}} were transported to Russia. During Germany's occupation of Latvia, they installed an <b>acetylene</b> <b>light</b> source. During WWI, the lighthouse was shelled by artillery. The original lighthouse was patched up, {{but it had}} to be demolished in 1932.|$|R
50|$|The first Cape Liptrap {{lighthouse}} {{was established}} in 1913. It was a 2.1 metre steel tower with an <b>acetylene</b> <b>light.</b> As a lighthouse keeper was never stationed at Cape Liptrap, it is really the first automatic Commonwealth funded light {{to be put into}} service.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, by the United States Lighthouse Service {{installed}} {{an automatic}} <b>acetylene</b> <b>light</b> {{to replace the}} hand operated oil lamp. Thus, {{it was no longer}} necessary to occupy the site since the light was automated. Captain Armstrong continued to be responsible for Peninsula Point until 1931.|$|R
50|$|Bagley {{took office}} on May 22 and presided over his first session of court on May 24 at the {{courthouse}} in Oregon City with a civil suit between Albinia Olds and the Oregon <b>Acetylene</b> <b>Lighting</b> Company. As a judge he oversaw famous trials including the yellow ticket trials and the Bowles trial. Bagley retired from the bench on January 15, 1935, and returned to private practice in Hillsboro and Bagley & Hare.|$|E
50|$|Wigham {{made many}} other inventions, {{largely in the}} area of {{maritime}} safety. He invented new oil-lamps, gas-lights and electric-lights, gas-powered fog signals, buoys, petroleum-fuelled buoy lights and <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> equipment. He was working on new electric illumination systems {{at the time of his}} death in 1906. Lights supplied by Edmundson & Co were used in lighthouses all over the globe; the firm still exists today as F. Barrett & Co, of Dublin.|$|E
50|$|Looking {{much like}} a long-barrel pistol, the Ronson Pisto-Lighter was {{exhibited}} at the 1912 Olympia (UK) car show on the Klaxon stand. It consisted of a file-like member which was drawn up {{the barrel of the}} pistol against a strong spring, and when the trigger was pressed it was released rubbing against a 'flinty substance' contained in the cap where the front sight of the pistol would be. This action was said to produce a constellation of sparks sufficient to light an acetylene lamp in the wildest wind. At the time <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> was standard for motor vehicles.|$|E

50|$|The second {{lighthouse}} {{was constructed}} in 1895 {{and for a while}} served as the rear light in the range. It had a 7.87 m, timber framed corrugated galvanized iron clad tower, with a lantern and a balcony. The original optical apparatus was a 4th order fixed lens with kerosene wick burner. In 1930 the light was converted to <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting,</b> with sun valve and flasher. By 1977 the original lens had been removed and a solar powered Tideland ML-300 electric beacon installed. A pilot station was established on the foreshore nearby in 1919, and closed in 1963.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{models were}} produced, the 'Standard model' which had <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> and bulb horn, priced in 1930 at £57/10/6 and the 'De Luxe model' which had {{electric}} lighting and instrument panel, priced in 1930 at £63/2/6. In 1931 both were designated A/2 and minor changes included a four speed gearbox with improved gear ratios with lower 1st and higher top gear {{and a more}} rounded petrol tank, the Amal carburettor jet was changed from 70 to 55 and {{the diameter of the}} exhaust pipe was increased with ports on the head spaced further apart (65/8" [...] instead of 51/8").|$|E

5000|$|It was {{originally}} planned {{to name the}} station after the village. However, the operating company also had a station at Newbiggin, Temple Sowerby, {{only a few miles}} away, and it was thought that the duplication of names would cause confusion with ticketing and operational matters. Accordingly, the station was named Blencow (without a final ‘e.') It {{was one of the first}} on the line to be illuminated by [...] "modern" [...] <b>acetylene</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1891 Trouvé {{developed}} electric multi-colored fountains {{for domestic}} and outdoor use. Seeing {{the limitations of}} electrical supply without the reliable support of a national grid, in 1895 he took the recent discovery of <b>acetylene</b> <b>light</b> and had soon harnessed it for domestic lighting. [...] Among his 75 innovations,(see below) he also developed an electric massaging machine, an electric keyboard instrument based on Savart's wheel, a battery-powered wearable lifejacket, a water-jet propelled boat and a streamlined bicycle, {{as well as several}} children's toys.|$|R
2500|$|... 1925 Sunbeam Model A, with an {{asthmatic}} side-valve 350cc single-cylinder engine, a hand-shift three-speed gearbox, {{a manual}} oil pump, <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>lights</b> and no milometer ...|$|R
50|$|In 1912 {{they made}} their first car, a cyclecar powered by an air cooled 998 cc V-twin engine which they built themselves. The tubular steel chassis had half {{elliptic}} springs all round. Drive was to the rear axle through a cone clutch, three speed gearbox with differential and finally a belt or chain to each rear wheel. A top speed of 50mph (80km/h) was claimed. The bodywork was open with two seats and <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> at the front and a single oil light at the rear. The basic car cost £110 or £120 with windscreen, hood, lights and horn. It was no longer being advertised in 1913 so production may have ceased.|$|E
5000|$|Mass {{was celebrated}} {{at the church}} {{sporadically}} for its first eight years; only in 1845, after several priests from the Congregation of the Precious Blood began serving St. Rose and several surrounding parishes, were the parishioners able to have regular services. By the 1850s, the log church building had become too small, so a replacement brick structure was constructed {{at a cost of}} $6,000 and consecrated in mid-1854. Measuring 42 ft by 75 ft, it was periodically modernized; by 1907, it featured such improvements as <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting.</b> [...] However, this structure in turn was becoming too small by this time; four years later, a third church building was begun, and it was consecrated in September 1912.|$|E
50|$|The 1914 {{model was}} {{exhibited}} at the 1913 Olympia show, the company still named Swift Cycle Co Ltd, at which time its price was £140 'fully equipped'. For 1914 the car changed over to steel channel frame carried on four semi-elliptic leaf springs. The car had worm and sector steering, and the brakes comprised a pedal operated transmission brake and two hand-lever operated external contracting brakes. The two-seater body had the seats slightly staggered, and the specification included the hood, adjustable windscreen, a boot, mudguards, running boards, and an <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> set. The engine remained at 970cc and was fitted with an Eisemann magneto and Claudel carburettor. The clutch was a leather lined cone type fitted into the external flywheel. The petrol tank was placed behind the dashboard and fed the carburettor by gravity.|$|E
50|$|Completed in 1877, the new {{lighthouse}} was 34 ft {{high and}} had an oil lantern with a 5th order Fresnel lens. In 1919 the oil lantern was replaced with an <b>acetylene</b> <b>light.</b> After it was discovered to be leaning to one side, in 1929 the lighthouse was removed and replaced with an 18 ft steel tower. The old iron lighthouse was transported back to Buffalo where it was later renovated and reinstalled as the East Charity Shoal Light on the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1935.|$|R
50|$|This {{light was}} {{decommissioned}} in 1924 and boarded up, {{being replaced by}} an automated <b>acetylene</b> <b>light</b> atop a 35 ft tall black steel skeleton tower {{to the east of}} the old light. The old station property and buildings were sold to Earl J. Coffey on August 24, 1925, and some time thereafter the steel skeletal tower was replaced by the currently operational cylindrical D9 tower with solar-powered 200 mm acrylic optic, which is basically a tube with a light on the top. It is functional, but spartan.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the passage}} of the 1912 Commonwealth Navigation Act, from 1 July 1915 Queensland handed over {{responsibility}} for its 30 manned lights and 37 unattended lights, beacons, and buoys to the Australian Government, who constructed additional lightstatons and made substantial upgrades to existing lights, with many lighthouses converted to unattended <b>acetylene</b> <b>lights.</b> The bulk of the expenditure was concentrated north of Cooktown where seven new lighthouses were constructed to guide ships through the Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef. Manned lighthouses were phased out in favour of less expensive, utilitarian-designed, unmanned structures.|$|R
50|$|She {{continued}} to be based at Paekakariki until 1916 when she was shipped to Greymouth in the South Island, where she saw service hauling the Greymouth - Otira mail trains. Her wooden cab was replaced {{at this stage in}} steel, and <b>acetylene</b> <b>lighting</b> replaced the original kerosene. In the early 1920s she was relegated to shunting and banking duties at Otira. For work in this role, 453 was fitted with back up sanding and a tender-cab, with the tender coal flare cut off and ladders fitted to access the tender body. In 1925 N 453's original boiler was removed and replaced with a new NZR built boiler. Despite this, in November 1926 No.9 was withdrawn from service, dismantled and tipped into the Bealey River on the Midland Line to check erosion. Why the locomotive was removed from service is not known, however all useful and re-usable components from the locomotive were removed, including the boiler which saw further service on Wb 300.|$|E

The cars initially sold for £189 but in 1900 they were selling for £168 and the company was producing 20 a week.One a week was being made in 1899, and in the first year, they made their first export sale, to Auckland, New Zealand. Exports became a major part of Star's business, particularly to Australia and New Zealand. In 1891 Lisle had adopted a 6 pointed star as their logo which led to a successful suit against Mercedes in 1902 where it was found they had infringed Star's copyright with their 3 or 4 pointed star emblem. In 1900, production had expanded to facilities in Dudley Road and Nelson, Stewart, Ablow, and Dobb Streets. A two-cylinder three-speed model appeared that year, also, at the Richmond Automobile Club Show. Encouraged by founder Edward Lisle, they were also being entered in the 1000 Miles' Trial (where it proved fragile), along with [...] "every test or competition for which they were eligible". In 1901, the 7 and 10 with vertical twin De Dion engines and in 1902 a four-cylinder 20 hp appeared. In 1903, copying the leading maker, Mercedes, Star introduced a 12 hp four, and set a record of 39 mph (63 km/h) on a 2-mile (3.2 km) run in County Cork, Ireland, under the auspices of the Irish Automobile Club. In addition, two Stars ran in the Isle of Man qualifying races for the Gordon Bennett Cup; neither 10-litre car made it. From 1904 only four-cylinder models were made.|$|E

60|$|All {{that had}} been left of the old Spanish house which had been Stillwell's home for so long was the bare, massive structure, and some of this had been cut away for new doors and windows. Every modern convenience, even to hot and cold running water and <b>acetylene</b> <b>light,</b> had been installed; and the whole {{interior}} painted and carpentered and furnished. The ideal sought had not been luxury, but comfort. Every door into the patio looked out upon dark, rich grass and sweet-faced flowers, and every window looked down the green slopes.|$|R
50|$|The first {{lighthouse}} on {{this site}} was privately erected in 1830. In 1858, the Lighthouse Service contracted with the Ellis and O'Neil firm to erect the present octagonal tower, which is connected directly to the keeper's house. Together with the Isle La Motte Light, it forms a rough line marking the channel {{through the center of}} the lake. It remained in service until 1931, when a steel tower was erected on the property with an automated <b>acetylene</b> <b>light</b> on top. The keeper's house was transferred to the customs service for use in battling smuggling during Prohibition. The tower and house were eventually sold to a private individual.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was designed}} by the Victorian Public Works Department and erected by the contractors Coates Brothers. It is of a traditional design consisting of a cylindrical tower and capital, similar to many late nineteenth century Victorian lighthouses, such as the earlier Point Hicks Lighthouse. It is built of reinforced concrete and surmounted by a Chance Brothers lantern. The original oil lamp of the light was first replaced with an <b>acetylene</b> <b>light</b> and later an electric light. Surrounding its base is the octagonal, two-storey, brick signal station and observation room. Halfway up the tower is a cantilevered platform supporting red and green navigation lights.|$|R
