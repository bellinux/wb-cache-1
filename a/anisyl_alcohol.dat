40|$|When Penicillium simplicissimum {{is grown}} on veratryl alcohol, <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> or 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol, an {{intracellular}} covalent flavin-containing vanillyl-alcohol oxidase is induced. The induction is highest (up to 5 % of total protein) during the growth phase. In addition to vanillyl-alcohol oxidase, an intracellular catalase-peroxidase is induced. Induction of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase in P. simplicissimum is prevented {{by the addition}} of isoeugenol to veratryl alcohol-containing media, but growth is unaffected. The inhibitory effect of isoeugenol on induction is not observed when <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> or 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol is used as the growth substrate. Based on the induction experiments and the degradation pathways for veratryl and <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> we propose that induction of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase is superfluous when P. simplicissimum is grown on these aromatic alcohols. However, the enzyme plays an essential role in the degradation of the methyl ether of p-cresol, 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol. ...|$|E
40|$|The white-rot {{basidiomycete}} Phanerochaete chrysosporium metabolized 3 -(4 ′-ethoxy- 3 ′-methoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 ″-methoxyphenyl) {{propionic acid}} (V) in low-nitrogen, stationary cultures, {{conditions under which}} ligninolytic activity is expressed. The ability of several fungal mutant strains to degrade V reflected their ability to degrade [14 C]lignin to 14 CO 2. 1 -(4 ′-Ethoxy- 3 ′-methoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 ″-methoxyphenyl) - 2 - hydroxyethane (VII), <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and 4 -ethoxy- 3 -methoxybenzyl alcohol were isolated as metabolic products, indicating an initial oxidative decarboxylation of V, followed by α, β cleavage of the intermediate (VII). Exogenously added VII was rapidly converted to <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and 4 -ethoxy- 3 -methoxybenzyl alcohol. When the degradation of V was carried out under 18 O 2, 18 O was incorporated into the β position of the diarylethane product (VII), indicating that the reaction is oxygenative...|$|E
40|$|The {{white rot}} fungus Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS 55 {{produces}} veratryl, anisyl, 3 -chloroanisyl, and 3, 5 -dichloroanisyl alcohol {{and the corresponding}} aldehydes de novo from glucose. All metabolites are produced simultaneously with the extracellular ligninolytic enzymes and have an important physiological function in the fungal ligninolytic system. Both mono- and dichlorinated <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> are distinctly better substrates for the extracellular aryl alcohol oxidases than veratryl alcohol. The aldehydes formed are readily recycled by reduction by washed fungal mycelium, thus creating an extracellular H 2 O 2 production system regulated by intracellular enzymes. Lignin peroxidase does not oxidize the chlorinated <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> either in the absence or {{in the presence of}} veratryl alcohol. It was therefore concluded that the chlorinated <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> are well protected against the fungus's own aggressive ligninolytic enzymes. The relative amounts of veratryl alcohol and the chlorinated <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> differ significantly according to the growth conditions, indicating that production of veratryl alcohol and the production of the (chlorinated) anisyl metabolites are independently regulated. We conclude that the chlorinated anisyl metabolites biosynthesized by the white rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS 55 can be purposefully produced for ecologically significant processes such as lignin degradation...|$|R

The characterisation of two new products from 1, 4 -dimethoxybenzene and 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetramethoxybenzene is also reported. The ability of di-, tri- and tetramethoxybenzene derivatives to facilitate the oxidation of less readily oxidised substrates such as <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and 4 -methoxymandelic acid has also been studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGrowth of Penicillium simplicissimum on <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> veratryl {{alcohol or}} 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol, is {{associated}} with the synthesis of relatively large amounts of the hydrogen peroxide producing flavoprotein vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO).

The C-terminus of the primary structure of VAO displays a WKL-COOH sequence which might function as a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS 1). As VAO activity results in production of hydrogen peroxide also the subcellular location of a recently characterized co-inducible catalase-peroxidase was studied.

40|$|AbstractThe white-rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. BOS 55 {{produced}} de-novo several aromatic metabolites. Besides veratryl {{alcohol and}} veratraldehyde, compounds which {{are known to}} be involved in the ligninolytic system of several other white-rot fungi, other metabolites were formed. These included anisaldehyde, 3 -chloro-anisaldehyde and a yet unknown compound containing two chlorine atoms. Additionally GC/MS analysis revealed the production of small amounts of <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and 3 -chloro-anisyl alcohol. After 14 days, the extracellular fluid of Bjerkandera BOS 55 contained 100 μM veratraldehyde and 50 μM 3 -chloro-anisaldehyde. This is the first report of de-novo biosynthesis of simple chlorinated aromatic compounds by a white-rot fungus. Anisaldehyde and 3 -chloro-anisaldehyde were also produced by Bjerkandera adusta but not by Phanerochaete chrysosporium...|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been reported that Pleurotus pulmonarius secretes a versatile peroxidase that oxidizes Mn 2 +, as well as different phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic compounds; this enzyme has also been detected in other Pleurotus species and in Bjerkandera species. During culture production of the enzyme, {{the activity of the}} main peak was as high as 1, 000 U/liter (measured {{on the basis of the}} Mn 3 +-tartrate formation) but this peak was very ephemeral due to enzyme instability (up to 80 % of the activity was lost within 15 h). In culture filtrates inactivation was even faster; all peroxidase activity was lost within a few hours. Using different inhibitor compounds, we found that proteases were not responsible for the decrease in peroxidase activity. Peroxidase instability coincided with an increase in the H 2 O 2 concentration, which reached 200 μM when filtrates were incubated for several hours. It also coincided with the onset of biosynthesis of anisylic compounds and a decrease in the pH of the culture. <b>Anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is the natural substrate of the enzyme aryl-alcohol oxidase, the main source of extracellular H 2 O 2 in Pleurotus cultures, and addition of <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to filtrates containing stable peroxidase activity resulted in rapid inactivation. A decrease in the culture pH could also dramatically affect the stability of the P. pulmonarius peroxidase, as shown by using pH values ranging from 6 to 3. 25, which resulted in an increase in the level of inactivation by 10 μM H 2 O 2 from 5 to 80 % after 1 h. Moreover, stabilization of the enzyme was observed after addition of catalase, Mn 2 +, or some phenols or after dialysis of the culture filtrate. We concluded that extracellular H 2 O 2 produced by the fungus during oxidation of aromatic metabolites is responsible for inactivation of the peroxidase and that the enzyme can protect itself in the presence of different reducing substrates...|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} {{faujasite}} (FAU) zeolites with different Si:Al ratio, and/or hierarchical porosity introduced via post-synthetic alkaline desilication treatment, {{have been evaluated}} as solid acid catalysts for esterification pretreatments of pyrolysis bio-oil components. Acetic acid esterification with aliphatic and aromatic alcohols including methanol, <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> benzyl alcohol, p-cresol and n-butanol was first selected as a model reaction to identify the optimum zeolite properties. Materials were fully characterised using N 2 porosimetry, ICP, XRD, XPS, FT-IR, pyridine adsorption, NH 3 TPD, In-situ ATR and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). IGC demonstrates that the surface polarity and hence hydrophobicity of FAU decreases with increased Si:Al ratio. Despite possessing a higher acid site loading and acetic acid adsorption capacity, high Al-content FAU possess weaker acidity than more siliceous catalysts. Esterification activity increases with acid strength and decreasing surface polarity following the order FAU 30 >FAU 6 >FAU 2. 6. The introduction of mesoporosity through synthesis of a hierarchical HFAU 30 material further enhances esterification activity through improved acid site accessibility and hydrophobicity. Methanol was the most reactive alcohol for esterification, and evaluated with HFAU 30 for the pretreatment of a real pyrolysis bio-oil, reducing the acid content by 76 % under mild conditions...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid" Mn-peroxidase (hMnP) {{isolated}} from the white rot fungus Panus tigrinus 8 / 18 was studied with respect to its reactions with veratryl alcohol {{in the presence of}} typical laccase mediators in the reaction mixture. Eight compounds were tested as potential mediators in this reaction and only 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and 3 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 3 -benzotriazin- 4 (3 H) -one (HBTO) were found to be effective. Up to 99 % of 1 M veratryl alcohol was oxidized with formation of veratraldehyde as a reaction product over 24 h depending on the buffer system used. Except for veratryl alcohol, <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> but not benzyl alcohol was oxidized in this reaction. Reactions with the participance of mediators were not catalytic, and the mediators were consumed during reaction with formation of dehydroxylated derivatives. Reactions with both HBT and HBTO resulted in temporal inactivation of hMnP. Kinetics of hMnP inactivation revealed it to be a pseudo-third order reaction. Investigation of the transformation of the absorption spectra of hMnP redox cycle intermediates in the presence of HBT or HBTO showed that the most likely reason of hMnP inactivation was its interaction with non-oxidized mediators...|$|E

In this work a rapid reliable and specific RP-HPLC method coupled with diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the simultaneous determination and quantification of the 24 volatile chemicals: amyl cinnamal, benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, citral, eugenol, hydroxy-citronellal, isoeugenol, amylcinnamyl alcohol, benzyl salicylate, cinnamal, coumarin, geraniol, Lyral (hydroxy-methylpentylcyclohexene carboxaldehyde), <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> benzyl cinnamate, farnesol, Lilial (2 -(4 -tert-butylbenzyl) propionaldehyde) linalool, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, hexyl cinnamal, limonene, methylheptin carbonate, alpha-isomethyl ionone (3 -methyl- 4 -(2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -yl) - 3 -buten- 2 -one). The 24 analytes were appropriately separated over a running time of 40 min, on a C 18 column using a simple gradient elution (acetonitrile/water) with flow rate from 0. 7 to 1. 0 ml/min and UV acquisition at 210, 254 and 280 nm. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r 2 > 0. 99) within test ranges. The method was successfully applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of the potential allergens in four commercial scented products, with satisfactory accuracy and precision. The results indicated that this simple and efficient method {{can be used for}} quality assessment of complex matrices such us cosmetic scented products...|$|E
40|$|The biocatalytic {{synthesis}} of anisyl acetate fragrance {{was carried out}} by direct esterification of acetic acid with <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> in sponge-like ionic liquids (SLILs), e. g. N,N,N,N-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([C 16 tma][NTf 2], N,N,N,N-octadecyltrimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([C 18 tma] [NTf 2]), etc. as reaction/separation media under conventional and microwave (MW) heating. These SLILs are temperatureswitchable ionic liquid/solid phases that behave as sponges. As liquid phases, they are excellent monophasic reaction media for the lipase-catalyzed {{synthesis of}} anisyl acetate, the product yield being improved up to 100 % for 2 hour reaction under the appropriate reaction conditions (i. e. SLIL concentration, alcohol: acid molar ratio, enzyme amount, dehydrating molecular sieves, temperature and MW heating). As a function of the phase behaviour of different SLIL/anisyl acetate mixtures, a new clean separation protocol based on the centrifugation of the solid IL/flavour ester through nylon membranes was proposed, which provided a nearly full separation of the solid SLIL and the easy recovery of the reaction mixture. The enzymatic synthesis of anisyl acetate in [C 16 tma] [NTf 2] under MW assistance, followed by the separation step of the solid SLIL, provided a nearly solvent-free fragrance product with up to 0. 89 g/mL concentration. The catalytic activity of the enzyme / SLIL system remained unchanged for ten consecutive operational cycles. This work reports a straightforward and sustainable approach for producing anisyl acetate as a natural flavour and demonstrates to be suitable for scaling-up, providing a high potential for practical application. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The cDNA {{encoding}} vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (EC 1. 1. 3. 7) {{was selected}} from a cDNA library constructed from mRNA isolated from Penicillium simplicissimum CBS 170. 90 grown on veratryl alcohol by immunochemical screening. The vaoA-cDNA nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1680 base pairs encoding a 560 -amino acid protein with a deduced mass of 62, 915 Da excluding the covalently bound FAD. The deduced primary structure shares 31 % sequence identity with the 8 α-(O-tyrosyl) -FAD containing subunit of the bacterial flavocytochrome p-cresol methyl hydroxylase. The vaoA gene was isolated from a P. simplicissimum genomic library constructed in λEMBL 3 using the vaoA-cDNA as a probe. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the vaoA gene with the cDNA nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene is interrupted by five short introns. Aspergillus niger NW 156 prtF pyrA leuA cspA transformed with the pyrA containing plasmid and a plasmid harboring the complete vaoA gene including the promoter and terminator was able to produce vaoA mRNA and active vanillyl-alcohol oxidase when grown on veratryl alcohol and <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> A similar induction of the vaoA gene was found for P. simplicissimum, indicating that similar regulatory systems {{are involved in the}} induction of the vaoA gene in these fungi. Introduction of a consensus ribosome binding site, AGAAGGAG, in the vaoA-cDNA resulted in elevated expression levels of active vanillyl-alcohol oxidase from the lac promoter in Escherichia coli TG 2.

30|$|Lignin {{peroxidase}} activity with substrate n-propanol {{was observed at}} {{a broad range of}} temperature from 10 to 90  °C signifying its excellent thermostability. The optimum temperature for AgNP synthesis using bacterial SE extract was 70  °C (Singh et al. 2013). In view of these facts, {{it is clear that the}} purified enzyme possess the ability to catalyze the reactions at high temperature and can be one of the proteins involved in AgNP synthesis from silver ions. Similar broad range temperature stability has been reported for lignin peroxidase enzymes purified from A. calcoaceticus NCIM 2890 (Ghodake et al. 2009) and B. laterosporus MTCC 2298 (Gomare et al. 2008). However, in contrary to our results, Kalyani et al. (2011) showed the maximum {{peroxidase activity}} at 40  °C, which reduced drastically at temperature above 40  °C. Fungal lignin peroxidases exhibit temperature optimum in the range of 23 – 25  °C (Wang et al. 2008). In accordance with our study, magnesium sulfate and ammonium nitrate has been reported to act as lignin peroxidase activator and inhibitor, respectively (Kalyani et al. 2011). Manganese ions have also been reported to enhance the production of lignin peroxidase in Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Wang et al. 2008). Microbial peroxidases have wide substrate specificity and can easily interact with hydroxyl and methoxy-substituted phenols (Kim and Shoda 1999; Yang et al. 2005). Lignin peroxidase from P. chrysosporium showed maximum activity with ferrocyanide followed by N,N-dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylenediamine, <b>anisyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> veratryl alcohol and guaiacol (Glumoff et al. 1990). Purified lignin peroxidase, in our study, also exhibited broad substrate specificity. However, the results are contradictory where we obtained higher activity with guaiacol than veratryl alcohol. It is well documented that lignin peroxidase in fungi degrades lignin with involvement of veratryl alcohol, which is a secondary metabolite and acts as a cofactor for the enzyme (Wang et al. 2008).|$|E
