5|$|Israeli eating customs also {{conform to}} the wider Mediterranean region, with lunch, rather than dinner, being the focal meal of a regular workday. “Kibbutz foods” have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts, and may consist of various types of cheeses, both soft and hard, yogurt, labne and sour cream, {{vegetables}} <b>and</b> <b>salads,</b> olives, hard-boiled eggs or omelets, pickled and smoked herring, a variety of breads, and fresh orange juice and coffee.|$|E
5|$|John Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), {{still with}} rather few {{precedents}} to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest.

Bills of fare are given for each month of the year.|$|E

40|$|Mayonnaise <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> {{dressing}} {{are fast}} becoming popular condiments for Malaysian. The {{aim of this}} study was to obtain the nutritional composition of mayonnaise <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> dressing commercially available in the Malaysian market. The data will be used to update the Malaysian Food Composition Database which was last updated in 1997. A total of six brands from each type of mayonnaise <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> dressing were sampled from local supermarkets in the Klang Valley and analysed using standard methods. The validity of test data was monitored with the application of internal quality controls in line with the requirements of ISO 17025. The energy contents of mayonnaise <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> dressings were up to 626. 40 kcal/ 100 g. Our findings were also in agreement with the energy labelling on the packaging. Sodium was high in mayonnaise <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> dressing because it is used in the final mixture of both condiments to improve their characteristics for certain reasons. Mayonnaise <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> dressing have been identified as potent sources of vitamin A and vitamin E and both condiments were found to contain high levels of these antioxidants. It can be concluded that this study are useful not only in providing information on the nutritional content of several commercial types of mayonnaise <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> dressing, but also in improving the public understanding of healthy food choices...|$|R

5|$|Much of Raël's {{advocacy}} concerning futuristic {{technology is}} described in his 2001 book, Yes to Human Cloning. He supported human genetic engineering {{in order to avoid}} genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular race or religion. Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology will make it possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially a power plant in each house), fur-like furnishings that are self-cleaning with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat <b>and</b> <b>salads</b> will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.|$|E

5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods <b>and</b> <b>salads.</b> At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E
5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables <b>and</b> <b>salads,</b> sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E
5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups <b>and</b> <b>salads,</b> suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E

25|$|The new {{restaurant}} was immediately popular. Washington Post food critic Phyllis Richman declared the restaurant's signature hamburger its best entree.
