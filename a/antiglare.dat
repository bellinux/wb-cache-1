50|$|Internationalised ECE Regulation 48, {{in force}} {{in most of}} the world outside North America, {{currently}} specifies a limited range within which the vertical aim of the headlamps must be maintained under various vehicle load conditions; if the vehicle isn't equipped with an adaptive suspension sufficient to keep the headlamps aimed correctly regardless of load, a headlamp leveling system is required. The regulation stipulates a more stringent version of this <b>antiglare</b> measure if the vehicle has headlamps with low beam light source(s) that produce more than 2,000 lumens - xenon bulbs and certain high-power halogens, for example. Such vehicles must be equipped with headlamp self-leveling systems that sense the vehicle's degree of squat due to cargo load and road inclination, and automatically adjust the headlamps' vertical aim to keep the beam correctly oriented without any action required by the driver.|$|E

40|$|The {{eyes and}} wings of some species of moth {{are covered with}} arrays of {{nanoscale}} features that dramatically reduce reflection of light. There have been multiple examples where this approach has been adapted for use in antireflection and <b>antiglare</b> technologies with the fabrication of artificial moth-eye surfaces. In this work, the suppression of iridescence caused by the diffraction of light from such artificial regular moth-eye arrays at high angles of incidence is achieved {{with the use of}} a new tiled domain design, inspired by the arrangement of features on natural moth-eye surfaces. This bio-mimetic pillar architecture contains high optical rotational symmetry and can achieve high levels of diffraction order power reduction. For example, a tiled design fabricated in silicon and consisting of domains with 9 different orientations of the traditional hexagonal array exhibited a ~ 96 % reduction in the intensity of the ? 1 diffraction order. It is suggested natural moth-eye surfaces have evolved a tiled domain structure as it confers efficient antireflection whilst avoiding problems with high angle diffraction. This combination of antireflection and stealth properties increases chances of survival by reducing the risk of the insect being spotted by a predator. Furthermore, the tiled domain design could lead to more effective artificial moth-eye arrays for <b>antiglare</b> and stealth applications...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) able to directly emit circularly polarized (CP) electroluminescence (CP-OLEDs) are rapidly gaining much interest, {{due to their}} possible applications in displays with <b>antiglare</b> filters and 3 D displays. Development of more efficient CP-OLEDs can open their use also in point-of-care and personalized diagnostic tools, since CP light alteration {{can be related to}} health state of irradiated tissues. In this work it is shown that the performance of chiral europium complex-based CP-OLEDs can be improved both in terms of external quantum efficiency (measured on all the Eu bands) and degree of polarization of emitted photons (as measured by the dissymmetry factor gEL), by proper active layer formulation and through a fine tuning of the architecture of the device. Polarization performances (gEL = − 1) are obtained about three times higher than for any other CP-OLED reported so far. Moreover, for the first time, it is shown that the position of the recombination zone (RZ) plays a major role on the polarization outcomes. In order to rationalize these results the level of light polarization is related to the position of the RZ allied with the reflection on the cathode through a simple mathematical model. The values predicted by this model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental ones...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of periodic surface-relief structures with grating constants from 200 nm to 100 microns on large areas {{leads to a}} wide field of applications. Effects of interest are the antireflection properties of high aspect ratio subwavelength gratings and the light management by structures in the micrometer scale. The size of the homogeneously structured area and the ease of producability is decisive for the commercialisation of such functional surfaces. Microstructures like these can be produced on large areas by holographic exposure processes. Subsequent holographic exposures with differing parameters lead to combined structures with distinct properties. Master structures in photoresist {{can be used to}} fabricate nickel stampers. Techniques like UV roller casting and hot embossing can be employed to replicate such microstructures on large areas with high precision. With such replication processes a very cost effective mass production is possible. With our holograph ic set-up periodic surface relief structures with various grating types and profile shapes can be realised with a good homogeneity on an area with dimensions up to 600 × 800 mm 2. The combination of stochastic and periodic structures offers the chance to obtain a multifunctional surface with <b>antiglare</b> and broadband antireflection properties.

40|$|Interference {{lithography}} (IL) is {{the best}} suited technology for the origination of large area master structures with high resolution. In prior works, we seamlessly pattern areas of up to 1. 2 x 1. 2 m 2 with periodic features, i. e. a diffraction grating with a period in the micron range. For this process we use an argon ion laser emitting at 363. 8 nm. Thus, feasible periods {{are in the range}} of 100 μm to 200 nm. Edge-defined techniques or also called (self-aligned) double patterning processes can be used to double the spatial frequency of such structures. This way, we aim to reduce achievable periods further down to 100 nm. In order to replicate master structures, we make use of nanoimprint lithography (NIL) processes. In this work, we present results using IL as mastering and NIL as replication technology in the fields of photovoltaics as well as display and lighting applications. In photovoltaics different concepts like the micron-scale patterning of the front side as well as the realization of rear side diffraction gratings are presented. The benefit for each is shown on final device level. In the context of display and lighting applications, we realized various structures ranging from designed, symmetric or asymmetric, diffusers, antireflective and/or <b>antiglare</b> structures, polarization optical elements (wire grid polarizers), light guidance and light outcoupling structures...|$|E
40|$|Context: There {{is growing}} body of {{evidence}} that use of computers can adversely affect the visual health. Considering the rising number of computer users in India, computer-related asthenopia might take an epidemic form. In view of that, this study was undertaken to find out the magnitude of asthenopia in computer operators and its relationship with various personal and workplace factors. Aims: To study the prevalence of asthenopia among computer operators and its association with various epidemiological factors. Settings and Design: Community-based cross-sectional study of 419 subjects who work on computer for varying period of time. Materials and Methods: Four hundred forty computer operators working in different institutes were selected randomly. Twenty-one did not participate in the study, making the nonresponse rate 4. 8 &#x 0025;. Rest of the subjects (n = 419) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent. Other relevant information was obtained by personal interview and inspection of workstation. Statistical Analysis Used: Simple proportions and Chi-square test. Results: Among the 419 subjects studied, 194 (46. 3 &#x 0025;) suffered from asthenopia during or after work on computer. Marginally higher proportion of asthenopia was noted in females compared to males. Occurrence of asthenopia was significantly associated with age of starting use of computer, presence of refractive error, viewing distance, level of top of the computer screen with respect to eyes, use of <b>antiglare</b> screen and adjustment of contrast and brightness of monitor screen. Conclusions: Prevalence of asthenopia was noted to be quite high among computer operators, particularly in those who started its use at an early age.

40|$|A key {{consideration}} {{in the design of}} any solar cell is the reduction of reflectance from the top surface. Traditional thin film antireflection schemes are being challenged by new techniques that involve texturing on the subwavelength scale to form ‘moth-eye’ arrays, so called because they are inspired by Nature’s answer to unwanted reflections, the arrays of pillars found on the eyes and wings of some species of moth. In this work, a new method is presented for the optimization of thin film coatings that accounts for the angular and spectral variations in incident solar radiation from sunrise to sunset. This approach is then extended to silicon moth-eye arrays to assess how effectively these surfaces can provide antireflection for silicon solar cells over a full day. The reflectance spectra of moth-eye surfaces are found to depend on the period of the arrays and the height and shape of the pillars, and consequently these parameters can be optimized for the solar spectrum. Simulations predict that replacing an optimized double layer thin film coating with a moth-eye array could increase the full day cell performance by 2 % for a laboratory cell and 3 % for an encapsulated cell. Compared to a perfectly transmitting interface, this corresponds to losses in short circuit current of only 5. 3 % and 0. 6 % for a laboratory and an encapsulated cell, respectively. Furthermore, fabrication of silicon moth-eye arrays by electron beam lithography and dry etching leads to predicted percentage losses at peak irradiance, compared to an ideal antireflective surface, of only 1 %. The potentially more scalable technique of nanoimprint lithography is also used to fabricate antireflective moth-eye arrays in silicon, over areas as large as 1 cm 2, demonstrating great potential for stealth and <b>antiglare</b> applications in addition to photovoltaics.

40|$|Electroactive {{materials}} which undergo reversible optical changes through electrochemical redox reactions by {{the application}} of an electric field are called electrochromic (EC) materials. Among various electrochromes, organic electrochromes such as poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and viologens can modulate visible light and offer high contrast ratios and fast switching times. In the present thesis, PEDOT/fulleropyrrolidine films were prepared {{for the first time}} and the optical response of the film is completely altered by the presence of the fullerene derivative; a coloration efficiency of 386 cm 2 C- 1 was acheived. Electrohromic devicves (ECDs) with a PEDOT film as cathode and a Prussian blue (PB) film as anode were constructured and the superior EC performance of the an in-situ polymerized ionic liquid based gel electrolyte compared to a conventional gel electrolyte was demonstrated. The optimized in-situ polymerized gel was then used in a heptyl viologen based ECD and the switching of a large area device (8 cm  6 cm) for <b>antiglare</b> electrochromic rearview (ECRA) mirrors was demonstrated. PEDOT films were then transposed over plastic substrates and their ability to serve as a transparent conductor and an electrochromic electrode was shown. Similarly viologens offer different colors depending on the N-substituent. Although a variety of viologens were synthesized in the past, a reversible and high write-erase efficiency continues to pose a formidable challenge. To address this concern, new derivatives of viologens were synthesized by the use of substituents like butylbenzimidazole and ethylindole, their ECDs were constructed and characterized. Further, a hybrid viologen was also prepared by using a phosphonitrillic trimer (P 3 N 3 Cl 6) as a central core and the potential of this viologen for durable, high contrast ECDs was shown. These viologen based ECDs showed very high contrast ratios, high coloration efficiencies, short response times and the devices can endure more than 2000 cycles without undergoing degradation. These devices and materials are very much useful for applications such as flexible displays, energy saving switchable windows in buildings and automobiles and ECRA mirrors...|$|E
