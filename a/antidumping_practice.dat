40|$|Blonigen and Haynes (2002) {{calculated}} that pass-through of antidumping duty estimates to U. S. pricing of 200 % {{would be required}} to eliminate potential antidumping duties. However, this calculation was based on an error in interpretation of U. S. <b>antidumping</b> <b>practice,</b> that antidumping duties themselves are subtracted in an antidumping calculation. In fact there is no such subtraction, and a pass-through of 100 % theoretically suffices to eliminate potential antidumping duties. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of antidumping measures could represent {{a source of}} mounting frictions in the trading systems among Canada, United States and Mexico. Mexico is an active user of antidumping measures suggesting that both private sector groups and government policy makers have found antidumping measures to be a convenient response to the pressures of import competition. In the last two decades, Mexico has opened its economy to international commerce. Nevertheless, its economy and legal system are not {{comparable to those of}} the United States or Canada, although it has adopted analogous antidumping laws. The Mexican <b>antidumping</b> <b>practice</b> is based today on common law practices influencing civil law formalities. In the NAFTA context, more specifically, in its Chapter 19, legal problems facing the binational panel review system have arisen from Mexico's different legal tradition, notably in the areas of transparency and procedural issues, standard of review, parallel amparo and the power of panel vis-a-vis national courts. The procedural requirements of the Antidumping Agreement prove a challenge for Mexico and will likely lead to trade disputes concerning procedure because it lacks the tradition of administrative and legal process...|$|E
40|$|The World Trade Constitutional Court Sungjoon Cho Abstract Although a court, as a {{judicial}} organ, usually fulfils its mission by resolving specific disputes brought to it, it occasionally goes beyond this simple dispute-resolving function and more actively engages in building policies which define, and “constitute,” the very polity {{to which the}} court belongs, as was seen in Brown v. Board of Education. If this “constitutional adjudication” is an integral function of any domestic high court, could (and should) an international tribunal, in particular the World Trade Organization (WTO) tribunal, also play such a distinctive role? This paper contends that the WTO tribunal has in fact assumed such role by having recently struck down a hoary <b>antidumping</b> <b>practice</b> called “zeroing” which tends to inflate dumping margins and thus is a central vehicle for contingent protection embedded in the antidumping mechanism. The paper observes that the recent proliferation of antidumping measures as a new protectionist instrument has motivated the AB’s hermeneutical departure from the past interpretation which had endorsed the practice. This, it argues, is a “constitutional” turn of the WTO which a positivist, inter-governmental mode of thinking, as is prevalent in other international {{organizations such as the}} United Nations, cannot fully expound. Critically, this turn originates from bold ideas which envision, and thus “constitute,” new institutional meaning and possibilities within the WTO. In other words, the AB’s exegesis is anchored firmly by a discernible purpose of cabining trade distortive/restrictive consequences from the use of zeroing which have long been left unchecked. Finally, WTO members, the paper maintains, must preserve the anti-zeroing jurisprudence as constitutional norms in the absence of extraordinary circumstances tantamount to a constitutional amendment...|$|E
40|$|The author {{analyzes}} current {{trade policies}} and {{challenges faced by}} the transition economies - especially countries {{in the former soviet}} Union - as they are integrated into the world trading system. With few exceptions, transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Baltics, have been well integrated into the multilateral trading system. Their trade regimes differ - and the main challenges they face involve their integration into the European Union. Integration into the multilateral trading system, including progress toward membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), varies significantly among the other countries of the former Soviet Union. Armenia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Moldova have adopted relatively liberal trade regimes and are either already members of the WTO or are close to it. These four countries need to strengthen the capacity of broad market-based (especially trade-related) institutions, including customs, the financial sector, and institutions to facilitate trade. The momentum for market and trade reform appearsto have stalled in some of the larger countries of the former Soviet Union: Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. Their trade regimes are not especially restrictive, but weak operations in fundamental market institutions inhibit their effective integration into the world trading system. These problems, together with persistent protective pressures, inhibit progress and accession to the WTO. The remaining countries in Central Asia, as well as Belarus, have far to go in introducing market-oriented reforms and institutions, and the kind of trade liberalization needed for integration into international trade. The countries of the former Soviet Union must make most of the reform and adjustment effort, but WTO members must make changes as well - especially the United States and the European Union. Both need to review their policies toward non-market economies on <b>antidumping</b> <b>practices</b> and (in the European Union) on safeguards. Countries where market decisions prevail should not be subjected to non-transparent and arbitrary procedures. In particular, countries that have been judged to be"market"economies in the process of gaining access to the WTO should be excluded from procedures applied for antidumping and safeguard measures in non-market economies.

40|$|A {{century has}} passed since the Government of Canada adopted the first {{recorded}} antidumping law in 1904. The Canadian legislation was soon followed by similar legislation {{in most of the}} major trading nations in the industrialized world prior to and after World War I. Antidumping provisions were later incorporated into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) following World War II. Nowadays, virtually all of the industrialized and developing countries in the world economy have adopted antidumping legislation. In view of the long and increasingly widespread use of antidumping measures, we marked the centennial of Canada’s 1904 legislation with a symposium at the University of Michigan on March 12, 2004. The symposium papers document the experiences with antidumping and then ask whether and how antidumping can be reformed. Although we all would probably agree that the best solution would be to retract all antidumping legislation, this is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. Antidumping laws serve a variety of purposes, and powerful political forces {{stand in the way of}} eliminating these laws. Antidumping provides a stronger and more focused means of safeguards protection against surges of imports than GATT-legal safeguards laws permit. Antidumping also formalizes a meaning for “unfair trade” that, though essentially meaningless from an economic standpoint, strikes a chord in public perception. And finally, in spite of its appearance of being constrained by objective administrative rules, <b>antidumping</b> in <b>practice</b> is a potent political tool that governments are able to manipulate in order to satisfy powerful constituents. With all this going for it, antidumping is unlikely ever to be relinquished as an economic policy tool by governments. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyIntroduction The {{interaction}} between antidumping and antitrust is a polemic issue in every integration process for both legal and economic reasons. From a legal perspective, <b>antidumping</b> rules allow <b>practices</b> such as price undertakings and quantitative trade restrictions that are forbidden by competition law, and punish {{certain types of}} price differentiation that are justifiable under the antitrust rules. From an economic viewpoint, the two policies pursue different objectives that eventually may lead to conflicting situations. Antidumping is a trade remedy for industries injured by import competition. The final goal of antitrust is to promote consumer welfare and productive efficiency, which in part depend upon market contestability, wherein import competition often plays a key role. This paper addresses several issues from three complementary perspectives. Section 2 summarizes the current debate about antidumping rules in the United States. This debate includes a large and growing academic literature that has been surveyed recently by Blonigen and Prusa (2001), papers and speeches by influential personalities such as Kenneth Dam, Alan Greenspan and Joseph Stiglitz, and the active participation of business associations, lawyers, lobbyists and politicians. This diverse collection of policy suggestions provides a normative background for the discussion {{in the rest of}} the paper. Section 3 reviews the instruments used by the European Union and the U. S. government for reconciling a strong enforcement of competition laws with an intense use of antidumping measures. Section 4 highlights some peculiarities of the FTAA process. Section 5 presents the main conclusions...|$|R
