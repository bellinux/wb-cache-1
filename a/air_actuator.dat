However, an SiC mirror is difficult to shape because the material is very hard and brittle. We are developing an SiC mirror by means of the ELID (ELectrolytic In-process Dressing) grinding method, a grinding machine with rotary table of 800 mm in diameter and precision of 10 nm in control resolution, and computational simulations. The ELID grinding method is versatile for fabrications of very hard materials.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} effort {{over the}} past several decades, the mechanics of earthquake rupture remains largely unknown. Moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes nucleate at 7 – 15 km depth and most information is retrieved from seismology, but information related to the physico-chemical processes active during rupture propagation is below the resolution of this method. An alternative approach includes the investigation of exhumed faults, such as those described here from the Adamello Massif (Italian Alps), and the use of rock deformation apparatus capable of reproducing earthquake deformation conditions in the laboratory. The analysis of field and microstructural/mineralogical/geo- chemical data retrieved from the large glacier-polished exposures of the Adamello (Gole Larghe Fault) provides information on earthquake source parameters, including the coseismic slip, the rupture directivity and velocity, the dynamic friction and earthquake energy budgets. Some of this information (e. g., the evolution of the friction coefficient with slip) can be tested in the laboratory with the recently installed Slow to HIgh Velocity Apparatus (SHIVA). SHIVA uses two brushless engines (max power 280 kW) and an <b>air</b> <b>actuator</b> in a rotary shear configuration (nominally infinite displacement) to slide solid or hollow rock cylinders (40 / 50 mm int/ext diameter) at: (1) slip rates ranging from 10 lm s- 1 up to 9 m s- 1; (2) accelerations up to 80 m s- 2; and (3) normal stresses up to 50 MPa. In comparison to existing high-speed friction machines, this apparatus extends the range of sliding velocities, normal stresses and sample size. In particular, SHIVA has been specifically designed to reproduce slip velocities and accelerations that occur during earthquakes. The characterization of rock frictional behavior under these conditions, plus the comparison with natural fault products, is expected to provide important insights into the mechanics of earthquakes...|$|E

The device produced head impact velocity and HIC results that were very repeatable when impacting surfaces with consistent force/deflection properties.

40|$|Recently, in the {{environment}} that coexists with human, the researchof the robots that thinks about life is demanded. As for human behavior,safety and flexibility are necessary for the robots because it is verycomplex. In addition, we demand {{the ability to move}} the body freelyfrom the robot. However, generally present walking robots are large,heavy, hard body structure. Therefore, there is a possibility of harminghuman when coming in contact at an early speed. So as not to havecome in contact with human up to now, it has avoided clash on therobots side. In a word, software of robots is controlled well and theproblem of the collision has been solved. However, it is difficult to solvethe clash problem completely with the software of the robot becausehuman is complex. Therefore, the walking robot from which the wholebody is encompassed with flexibility is necessary. We investigatedpaying attention to {{the main part of the}} robot like links and actuators. As a result, a lot of solid body links and the solid body actuators areresearched. And, our life has changed greatly by those robots. However,the research of the robot with a flexible whole body is very little. Inaddition, the robot has the problem of the passing speed of takingabout as much as eight minutes a drive. On the other hand, a flexiblerobot of the polymer gel should be used with the liquid. Therefore,there is a problem that the range that can be driven is limited. Therefore, the robot where it walks by a flexible body has not beenachieved globally. Then, a flexible robot greatly depends on theactuator. A lot of artificial muscular actuators are researched now. However, those actuators have the problem that the rigidity is low asthe link and the using in water. In addition, mounting is difficultthough there is a robot that moves rubber by using the <b>air</b> <b>actuator,</b> too. Thus, there is no actuator that can use flexibility as a walking robot. Then, we developed some flexible robots where it walked by using thedisplacement of a flexible link of laminae. These robots are locomotionstrategies different from a past mechanism. And, we finally aim toexpand the field of research of the flexible walking robot. This dissertation is composed of Chapter 6, and each content of achapter is as follows. Chapter 1 describes the background and thetrend of the research, and shows the issues and the problem of a pastrobots. Next, I explains the purpose, and the composition of thedissertation has been put together. In Chapter 2, I investigated aflexible actuator. And, I proposes the FFP actuator that combines SMA(shape-memory alloy) and a lamina for a walking robot. As for theproduced FFP （Flexible Flat Plate ）actuator, it is disengaged from theliquid and assembly in the robot is easy because of a simplemechanism. In addition, the dynamic characteristic of the FFPactuator is evaluated for the development of the robots from the nextchapter. In Chapter 3, to expand the field of research of the flexiblewalking robot, some kinds of the FFP actuators are presented. Theexpansion of the movement morph and the effectiveness of the robotsare referred by achieving the robot. In Chapter 4, the two-leggedwalking robot was developed for the flexible walking robot of thesimplest composition and the control. And, the examination ofeffectiveness and the problem is added from the result of the walkingachievement. In Chapters 5, quadruped walking robot was developed. And, the payload of the robot was confirmed. The gait pattern of therobot (advancement walking, retreat walking, and turn walking) wasestablished at eventually. Chapter 6 refers the view and the problemin the future. As mentioned above, this dissertation is a summary ofpurport of developing the walking robot using the displacement of aflexible link, and expanding the flexible walking robot field. 電気通信大学 200...|$|E

They are hard to transport to other areas once installed. Pneumatic linear actuators are likely to leak and this makes them less efficient than mechanical linear actuators.|$|R
