40|$|We {{present the}} results of our study of astrometric {{stability}} of 200 -in Hale (Mt. Palomar) and 10 -m Keck II (Mauna Kea) telescopes, both with Adaptive Optics (AO) facilities. A group of nearby visual binaries and multiples was observed in near infrared, relative separations and position angles measured. We have also checked the influence of some systematic effects (e. g. <b>atmospherical</b> <b>refraction,</b> varying plate scale factor) on result and precision of astrometric measurements. We conclude that in visual binaries astrometrical observations it is possible to achieve much better precision than 1 miliarcsecond, which in many cases allows detection of the astrometrical signal produced by planetary-mass object.
