40|$|Technology has had {{an undeniable}} impact on both society and law, {{particularly}} {{in the realm of}} personal data. The use of bots has allowed for the processing of information on an unprecedented scale. This thesis asks whether the General Data Protection Regulation (“the GDPR”) will be able to provide appropriate protection for data subjects when processing is performed by bots, while also balancing the rights and interests of data controllers, and promoting the healthy and socially desirable development of technology. In chapter I, this thesis begins by searching for a common definition of bots. It is concluded that “what is a bot?” cannot be answered with a simple definition, but should instead involve asking whether a particular program exhibits a number of different factors, including whether it is self-executing, whether it acts without human interference and whether it operates within a wider network. The thesis then divides bots into three broad categories: automated process bots, data miners and decision makers. The thesis then turns to the law. It begins with an overview of data protection law in Europe, summarising the hierarchy of laws and their purposes. It concludes that European data protection law operates on three levels: human rights (e. g. the ECHR), general regulation (e. g. the GDPR) and then specific regulation (e. g. the ePrivacy Directive). Chapter II of this thesis contains an in-depth analysis of the GDPR. It examines the most important aspects of data protection law raised by processing by bots: the basic concepts of data protection law (being the concepts of personal data, processing, controller and processor); the justification for processing (with a particular focus on consent); data quality principles and data subject rights; and the right to data portability, the right to object and the right not to be subject to an automated decision. As part of this examination, the thesis looks at the contents of the legal rules, how they apply to processing by bots and whether this is desirable or not. The general findings of this section are that the GDPR has a number of issues when applied to processing by bots, but that none of these issues necessarily prevent data controllers from using bots, and many provisions do encourage bots to develop in a socially desirable way. However, notable issues with the law include that the definition of personal data is extremely wide when considering the capabilities of bots to identify, or re-identify, data subjects from supposedly anonymous data sets; that consent may not provide an adequate level of protection for data subjects (both in general and particularly in relation to bots); that the data quality principles are extremely vague and may not fit processing by bots particularly neatly; that the right to object, although clearly intended to apply to bots, is somewhat limited by other factors; and that the right not to be subject to <b>automated</b> <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making suffers from a number of drafting ambiguities, but (if interpreted correctly) could provide good protection, although there is a risk that the ability to consent to such decisions will render this protection useless in practice. Chapter III then examines the impact of the different regulatory approaches. This chapter begins by looking at the weaknesses of the general regulatory approach, before considering whether a specific regulatory approach aimed directly at bots would be able to address these issues. It is concluded that although the specific regulatory approach does have some strengths, its weaknesses (e. g. difficulties with defining the scope of the regulation) render it unattractive as a solution. Instead, the thesis recommends a hybrid approach, where a general regulatory structure is complimented by specific rules where necessary. Finally, ch. III looks at non-legal regulation and concludes that it can be a useful compliment to help address some of the ambiguities caused by a general regulatory approach. The thesis concludes by considering the arguments discussed above and finding that, on balance, the GDPR is capable of providing adequate protection to data subjects, while balancing the rights and interests of data controllers and promoting the healthy and socially desirable development of technology. However, the current implementation of the GDPR is not perfect. There is, therefore, still work to be done on improving the law, both in terms of statutory interpretation of the existing laws, the use of amending legislation where necessary, and the growth of complimentary non-legal regulatory methods...|$|E

40|$|Beach, 1997). These reviews {{have focused}} {{primarily}} on models of <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making {{and the state of}} the art in that realm. None of these reviews have given much attention to the burgeoning body of literature on group decision making. The group decision making literature has reached a high growth rate in the last decade primarily due to the interest in group process and, especially, to effective teamwork as businesses have organized work structures more and more around teams. Nevertheless, linkages between the vast research in <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making and group decision processes are slight. For instance, there is a large body of work on normative <b>decision</b> models in <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making (Von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1947; Edwards, 1954), but these models are rarely mentioned in the literature on group decision making. This paper presents a model of group decision making process that partially fills this gap. <b>Individual</b> <b>decision</b> making has its roots in the model of the rational man beginning as far back as Bernouli and the 1740 ’s. These models of decision making were mathematical, based upon statistical principles. The rational man model assumes that the decision maker is a) completely informed, b) infinitely sensitive, c) rational (Stevenso...|$|R

We therefore combine the predominant design for ambiguous prospects in <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making, the two-color Ellsberg urn, with predominant designs in financial trading, the double auction and the call market, and compare trading in risky and in ambiguous assets. Our results suggest that markets are able to wash out ambiguity effects, which we do observe in an <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making control. We find no effects on transaction prices or quotes and also no effects on volume, volatility, or portfolios. This applies both to double auctions and call markets, with and without simultaneous trading of risky and ambiguous assets, and {{even in the absence of}} arbitrage. ...|$|R
40|$|This report proposes an {{extension}} to existing models of non-expected utility (NEU) in the stated preference (SP) literature.

Empirical testing of the proposed decision model {{was carried out in}} Australia using a dichotomous choice contingent valuation study of a national carbon pollution reduction scheme (CPRS). The results of the study demonstrate that subjective expectations of the context scenario and subjective policy expectations are important determinants of <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making in a stated preference framework. The results of the study also demonstrate that decision weight functions are non-linear (quadratic) in subjective scenario expectations and subjective policy expectation. Although evidence was found to link willingness to pay to scenario ambiguity, policy ambiguity was found to have no statistically significant influence on <b>individual</b> <b>decision</b> making. non-expected utility, scenario ambiguity, policy ambiguity, climate change, Australia, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, C 93 -D 81,...|$|R
