40|$|For MWPC {{used for}} X-ray {{position}} detection, simulation {{study of the}} <b>anode</b> wire <b>modulation</b> effect of the detector was carried out with Garfield program. Different gas mixtures were used as the working gas in the simulation, so as to obtain {{the influence of the}} X-ray cross section and electron diffusion coefficient of the working gases on the <b>anode</b> wire <b>modulation</b> effect of MWPC which has a anode wire spacing of 2 mm. Results show that, though working gas with higher X-ray cross section implies a larger average drift distance of ionized electrons, using of such gas mixtures is of little use to improve the <b>anode</b> wire <b>modulation</b> effect of MWPC. And the transverse electron diffusion coefficient is the determining factor that affects the extent of the <b>anode</b> wire <b>modulation</b> effect of the detector...|$|R

40|$|A 500 MHz, 300 KW Klystron power {{amplifier}} provides RF {{power to the}} ALS Storage Ring. In order to accommodate the amplitude and phase changes during beam stacking and decay, which demand continuously varying power levels from the Klystron, four loops are used to keep the system operating properly, with two of those loops dedicated to keeping the two cavity tuners on tune. Description of the control loops and their performance data will be given. Using the <b>modulation</b> <b>anode</b> of the Klystron in the amplitude loop will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{morphology}} of {{the ceramic}} coatings can be modulated by gas evolution on anodes during micro arc oxidation (MAO) processes. A novel technique to enhance gas evolution using Na 2 CO 3 ―containing solution was proposed. MAO ceramic coatings were fabricated on AZ 31 magnesium alloy using Na 2 CO 3 {{as a special}} additive in Na 3 PO 4 +KOH +NaF base electrolyte. The effects of Na 2 CO 3 addition on the reaction of gas evolution near the <b>anode,</b> morphology <b>modulation</b> and chemical composition were investigated by using GC―MS, SEM, XRD and FTIR, respectively. The results show that both O 2 and CO 2 are evolved from the anode with Na 2 CO 3 addition during MAO process. MgCO 3 {{is found in the}} coating during the anodic oxidation before MAO, while only MgO is detected in the coating after MAO process. It is attributed to the decomposition of MgCO 3 to MgO and CO 2 due to local high temperature. Na 2 CO 3 addition has slight effect on the microstructure of the coating and MgO is the main phase no matter whether Na 2 CO 3 is utilized. With the addition of Na 2 CO 3 the number of larger―size pores decreases and porosity in the coatings increases...|$|R
40|$|For {{possible}} future accelerator projects, as, e. g., the Super-Conducting Proton Linac, SPL, at CERN, {{it would be}} desirable to reuse {{as much of the}} LEP/RF equipment as possible. In the SPL, as in other proposed proton linacs, pulsed operation is required with RF pulse-lengths varying between 1 and 3 ms and a pulse repetition rate of 50 Hz. The LEP klystrons are equipped with a <b>modulation</b> <b>anode</b> by means of which their beam current and hence the output power can be controlled. In LEP the klystron output power had to be varied very slowly when the energy was ramped. In order to keep a high efficiency also in pulsed mode the rise- and fall-time of the beam pulse in the klystron should be considerably less than 100 µs. This goal was achieved by modifying the tetrode modulator, the HV line between modulator and klystron, and the filter network of the HV power supply. SPICE simulations were performed to evaluate the optimum values of capacitors and inductors in the HV filtering network of the LEP 100 kV, 40 A power converter when a specified DC pulse shape is required and up to eight klystrons are to be powered by one HV supply. These simulations are presented, together with the experimental results obtained on a modified LEP klystron/power converter assembly...|$|R
40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is {{an intense}} neutron source for neutron {{scattering}} experiments. The project {{is in the}} research stage, with construction funding beginning next year. The SNS is comprised of an ion source, a 1, 000 MeV, H{sup {minus}} linear accelerator, an accumulator ring, a neutron producing target, and experimental area to utilize the scattering of the neutrons. The linear accelerator is RF driven, and the peak beam current is 27 mA and the beam duty factor is 5. 84 %. The peak RF power required is 104 MW, and the H{sup {minus}} beam pulse length is 0. 97 ms at a 60 Hz repetition rate. The RF pulses must be about 0. 1 ms longer than the beam pulses, due to the Q of the accelerating cavities, and {{the time required to}} establish control of the cavity fields. The modulators for the klystrons in this accelerator are discussed in this paper. The SNS is designed to be expandable, so the beam power can be doubled or even quadrupled in the future. One of the double-power options is to double the beam pulse length and duty factor. The authors are specifying the klystrons to operate in this twice-duty-factor mode, and the modulator also should be expandable to 2 ms pulses at 60 Hz. Due to the long pulse length and low RF frequency of 805 MHz, the klystron power is specified at 2. 5 MW peak, and the RF system will have 56 klystrons at 805 MHz, and three 1. 25 MW peak power klystrons at 402. 5 MHz for the low energy portion of the accelerator. The low frequency modulators are conventional floating-deck <b>modulation</b> <b>anode</b> control systems...|$|R
