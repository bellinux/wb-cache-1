This {{research}} is conducted to determine the spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addict</b> in Pontian District, Johor from 2007 to 2010. This research is also conducted to investigate the spatial relationship between socio-economic aspects and their influence on the <b>drug</b> <b>addict</b> particularly in the selected study area. The variables {{used in this study}} consist of new and repeated <b>drug</b> <b>addicts,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> and ages <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addict.</b> The socio-economic focuses on the types of employment and level of education. The data are analyzed using Mean Center and Standard Deviation Ellipse to assess the mean and spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in the study area. Then, the analysis involves the use of Getis Ord-G* and Moran’s I to identify the hotspot and coldspot <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in Pontian District. In contrast, the <b>drug</b> <b>addict</b> data and socio-economic factors were analyzed using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) in order to gauge the relationship between the included factors. The research findings show that the distribution pattern <b>of</b> new <b>drug</b> <b>addict</b> occur in the urban and sub-urban areas. On the other hand, the status <b>of</b> repeated <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> are identified in the rural areas. The correlation between the new and repeated <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> with high school education and the types of employment (agro) show there is random spatial relationship between <b>drug</b> <b>addicts,</b> levels <b>of</b> education and types of work. Therefore, this research is believed to be able to assist in illustrating <b>drug</b> <b>addict</b> phenomena together with its relationship to socio-economic factor spatially. The use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and spatial statistics are good effort to help various goverment sectors especially National Anti Drug Agencies (AADK) and Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) in monitoring and subsequently combating the spread <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> and subsequently developing a safer environment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Many {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> individuals exhibit impaired performance on executive function tests but {{a few studies have}} been conducted on executive functions <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in Iran. To contribute to this understanding, the present study was designed to assess some domains related to executive functions including cognitive flexibility, attention and speed of mental processing in a sample <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in comparison with a sample of non-drug addicts. Methods: 155 male addicts between 25 to 35 years of age were selected from outpatient addiction clinics in Karaj, Iran. This group consisted of 3 subgroups of opium (n= 40), hydrochloride heroin (n= 63), and methamphetamine (n= 52) addicts. A control group was selected matching the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in gender, age, education and scio-economic status and included 130 healthy non-drug taking males. A battery of standardized executive function tests including the Color trail making test, Stroop color word test, and Symbol digit modalities test were administered. Data analysis was conducted by performing Co-variance (MANCOVA) in SPSS. v. 16. 0. Results: The study findings indicated that the group <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects performed significantly worse compared with the controls on all executive measures. There were also significant differences among the 3 subgroups. The hydrochloride group had the worst performance compared the methamphetamine and opium groups respectively. <b>Drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects with longer duration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction were much worse on all measures in comparison with <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects with shorter duration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction. Discussion: The study results confirmed that the functions of specific brain regions underlying cognitive flexibility, attention and speed of mental processing were significantly impaired in the group <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects. These impairments were also significantly related to type <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> used and duration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction that may contribute to most of behavioral disturbances found in <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> and need specific attention for intervention and treatment programs...|$|R

Negative factors <b>of</b> re-socialization <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in the area of legal awareness are: low assessment of legal norms in the sphere <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> trafficking leading to neglect them; distrust to the legal system of the state; readiness for violations of the law and the deliberate denial of the role of law in the society. Social and psychological factors that contribute to the re-socialization of addicts are: recognition oneself sick, desire to recover; religion; critical attitude to the past and to own experience; formation of the system of social values (primarily spiritual and family); the presence of life goals and plans; moral control regarding drug use; problem-oriented strategies of coping-behavior. Low level of legal awareness in the field of using psychoactive substances hinder re-socialization; weak motivation for retrieval (recovery); inadequate self-esteem; distorted system of values and beliefs (inadequacy of real and declarative values, immaturity of value orientations, lack of life goals and plans); unformed emotional and behavioral self-control; resistance to changes (the presence of a rigid system of mental protection and inadequate coping-strategies); weak moral control <b>of</b> regarding <b>drug</b> abuse; specificity <b>of</b> lifestyle (rental lifestyle, self-centeredness).

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I address the quality <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in {{dependence}} on the duration <b>of</b> their <b>drug</b> use and their age. <b>Drug</b> <b>addicts</b> {{have a number of}} social problems and are also exposed to health risks. The objective of my thesis was to determine the quality-of-life score of those persons, and to ascertain whether their quality of life differs in comparison with the general population and also in comparison between the individual groups into which the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> were divided according to the period <b>of</b> the <b>drug</b> use. In order to achieve these objectives, I raised hypotheses H 1 : <b>Drug</b> <b>addicts</b> have lower quality of life than the general population, H 2 : The quality <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> deteriorates in relation with the length of the addiction, and H 3 : The quality <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> is lower with increased person age. The method used in my work was SF- 36 questionnaire. From the results of my work it follows that, in statistic terms, <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> have considerably lower quality of life than the control group in all 8 examined fields (domains). Actually, in three domains the average score achieved by the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> did not reach even a half of the score achieved by the control group. Hypothesis H 1 was confirmed. Comparison of individual groups <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts,</b> namely the persons addicted for 11 - 15 years and the group of users (0 - 5 years), revealed an interesting value of emotional restriction of roles. From this comparison it follows that the persons who have been <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> for rather a long time {{have not been able to}} hold their social roles in the society in emotional terms any more, which confirms also hypothesis H 2. In the end was hypothesis H 3 confirmed. It is also obvious from the results of my work that, while working with <b>drug</b> <b>addicts,</b> the attention needs to be given to their motivation to undertake treatment so that their quality of life ceases to deteriorate and, on the contrary, improves again in their life without drugs...|$|R

40|$|The Effectiveness <b>of</b> Therpay for <b>Drug</b> <b>Addicts</b> and Their Integration within Society The {{purpose of}} my thesis "The Effectiveness <b>of</b> Therapy for <b>Drug</b> <b>Addicts</b> and Their Integration in Society" is to {{elucidate}} {{the lifestyles of}} addicts during different stages of therapy and to help people to understand the problems <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts.</b> The function <b>of</b> the brain can be altered by a number <b>of</b> psycho-active <b>drugs</b> that can influence a person's behavior, conscience, morals and mood. Drug addiction results in an uncontrollable urge to acquire <b>drugs,</b> regardless <b>of</b> the consequences. This behavior leads to a gradual exclusion <b>of</b> the <b>drug</b> <b>addict</b> from society. Re-integration into society must be the goal of treatment. The social exclusion of addicts seriously hampers their attemts to find employment. Many addicts started to use illicit drugs {{before the age of}} 18 years. Their education has not been completed and their bonds with their family members have been broken. Health problems caused by drugs, alcohol, a low quality nourishment, often untreated infections, poor hygiene, poor or absent living arrangements are factors that contribute to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> from society. The abstinence from drugs, for longer than three months, creates a precondition for recovery and re-integration into society. However, {{in the absence of a}} postive change in attitude of the addict towards society and in the abscence of a social safety net, drug abstinence alone does not represent a reliably positive prognostic indicator. Complex social services that include protected housing, employment, job counselling, out-patient or in-patient psychotherapy, are necessary for successful treatment...|$|R
