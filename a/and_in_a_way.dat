In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E

25|$|Patrick {{decides to}} {{continue}} working at General Hospital, and relocates to Port Charles. Robin also decides {{to stay in the}} place she called home for most of her life. The two often disagree on patients' treatment, with Patrick leaning toward more invasive surgeries and Robin wanting to use drug therapies. The opposing physicians quarrel at the hospital on a daily basis. But it is Noah and Patrick's non-existent father/son relationship that helps develop Patrick and Robin's relationship. When he was a teenager, Patrick's mother died during a surgery that Noah was performing. Noah could not forgive himself and turned to alcohol as a result. He became a neglectful father and his relationship with Patrick suffered severely. At the same time, Robin developed her own set of father issues with the re-emergence of a not-so-dead Robert Scorpio. Early on, Robin and Patrick connected because of their dead beat nonexistent fathers. Though her father left shortly after he returned and never fully healed their broken relationship, Robin tried to mend the fence between Patrick and Noah <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> acted as mediator. Robin and Patrick learn more about each other's pasts and soon Robin is able to convince Patrick to talk to his father. In conversation, Patrick admits his love for his father and inspires Noah to go to rehab.|$|E

The baptism in the Spirit makes real <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> renews Christian initiation". Emphasis of the event is on the release of existing spiritual gifts already given to the individual through baptism in water and confirmation.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{praised the}} episode's ending, saying [...] "I think we're {{most proud of}} the ending: Mulder's quest is re-established (and Daniel Sackheim {{directed}} it beautifully) with Mulder sitting alone in a church with only his faith. The story, again, was fueled by Mulder's belief and emotional connection with this case.

500|$|Another {{important}} weakness {{grew from}} the contradiction between {{the idea of}} collective security that {{formed the basis of}} the League and international relations between individual states. The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that might endanger their national interests, to support states for which they had no normal affinity. This weakness was exposed during the Abyssinia Crisis, when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe [...] "to defend against the enemies of internal order", in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia {{as a member of the}} League.|$|E

Whitney was created as part of her new family; the daughter of Bianca's deceased partner Nathan Dean. She was described as [...] "a teenage drama queen, unable to engage brain before mouth and constantly finding herself in and out of trouble". Bianca sees Whitney as one of her own, and also as [...] "a friend and confidante". EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer said that his vision for the character was someone [...] "quite spiky, quite , a bit of an equal to Bianca, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> a version of Bianca at that age". Shona McGarty was cast in the role.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's first live {{performance}} of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] {{was at the}} 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. She started the performance by descending from a flight of stairs, wearing a pin-striped suit and a monocle. Later she removed the coat to reveal her bustier, and together with her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory, performed a dance routine called voguing. Ian Inglis, author of Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time noted that the historical importance of Madonna's performance at the Video Music Awards {{was due to the}} televisual venue. Inglis explained that since Madonna's performance was striking primarily as a high-energy, provocatively choreographed, dance production number, it went on to highlight the 'TV' part of MTV, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> heralded her and the network as a cultural arbiter.|$|E
500|$|Glicken's {{father said}} in 1991 {{that his son}} died {{pursuing}} his passion, {{and that he was}} [...] "totally absorbed" [...] with volcanology. United States Geological Survey co-worker Don Peterson adds that Glicken was keen in his enthusiastic approach to observation, and praises his accomplishments throughout his career and as a graduate student. Speaking about Glicken's personal passion for his field, his mentor and professor Richard V. Fisher writes, [...] "What happened at St. Helens is something that troubled [...] deeply for a very long time, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> I think it made him even more dedicated than he was before." [...] Associate Robin Holcomb remarks that [...] "Harry was very enthusiastic, very bright, and very ambitious, ambitious to do something worthwhile on volcanoes." [...] Many studies have utilized Glicken's criteria for volcanic landslide recognition, and many subsequent papers on avalanches have acknowledged or referenced Glicken's 1996 report. Reflecting on Glicken's body of work, USGS employee Don Swanson names him as [...] "a world leader in studies of volcanic debris avalanches".|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the {{polarization}} of religion {{viewed in the}} episode, noting that [...] "although 'Signs and Wonder's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith, it offers a pessimistic—and distorted view of religion." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I {{have always been the}} type of person who admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success. [...] This is precisely the mindset I'm feeling after watching 'Signs and Wonders'. I admire the attempt to spook me, to offer up conflicting views of religion and righteousness, even if I'm not completely sure what the point of it all was." [...] Nevertheless, Kessenich praised the snake attack scenes and the episode's occasional quips of humor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+". Despite writing that the snake attack scenes were [...] "surprisingly horrifying" [...] and that the episode contained [...] "plenty [...] to recommend", he was critical about the lack of explanation behind Mackey. Although he had a positive opinion of the first 30 minutes, he wrote that the [...] "last 10 minutes just sink everything good the episode has going, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that hurts everything that came before." ...|$|E
500|$|The crucial {{break from}} the concept of {{constant}} typological classes or types in biology came with {{the theory of evolution}} through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a [...] "struggle for existence" [...] in which favorable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism. Darwin developed his theory of [...] "natural selection" [...] from 1838 onwards and was writing up his [...] "big book" [...] on the subject when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a version of virtually the same theory in 1858. Their separate papers were presented together at a 1858 meeting of the Linnean Society of London. At the end of 1859, Darwin's publication of his [...] "abstract" [...] as On the Origin of Species explained natural selection in detail <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of Darwin's concepts of evolution at the expense of alternative theories. Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe.|$|E
