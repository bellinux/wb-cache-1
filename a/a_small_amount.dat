5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust {{thought that the}} residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking ethylene glycol. Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain.

5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of gene flow may remove genetic differences between {{parts of a}} population.

5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, such as the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.|$|E

30|$|This study aims {{to present}} a new {{application}} of the framework in a full scale lignite production, where the initial resource model generation is automated based on a short-term model. This would immediately increase the production efficiency in a real mining environment, by simply giving the opportunity to react on the changes of the resource model with newly gained information. Moreover, using the real-time updating framework would also decrease the frequency of material misallocation. Having an improved resource model helps to have <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amount</b> of actual lignite being incorrectly allocated to the waste dump. And similarly, <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amount</b> of actual waste send to the stockpile.|$|R
