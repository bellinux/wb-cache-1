40|$|Analyzing {{the halo}} and galaxy catalogs from the Millennium {{simulations}} at redshifts z= 0, 0. 5, 1, we determine the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies {{by measuring the}} average alignments between the major axes of the pseudo inertia tensors from all satellites within cluster's virial radius and from only those satellites within some smaller radius {{as a function of}} the top-hat scale difference. The alignment profiles quantify how well the satellite galaxies retain the memory of the external tidal fields after merging into their host clusters and how fast they lose the initial alignment tendency as the cluster's relaxation proceeds. It is found that the <b>alignment</b> <b>profile</b> drops faster at higher redshifts and on smaller mass scales. This result is consistent with the picture that the faster merging of the satellites and earlier onset of the nonlinear effect inside clusters tend to break the preferential alignments of the satellites with the external tidal fields.

There are several steps that must be performed in creating profile–profile alignments, and each involves choices in parameters and algorithms. These steps include (1) what sequences to include in a multiple alignment used to build each profile, (2) how to weight similar sequences in the multiple alignment and how to determine amino acid frequencies from the weighted alignment, (3) how to score a column from one profile aligned to a column of the other profile, (4) how to score gaps in the profile–profile alignment, and (5) how to include structural information. Large-scale benchmarks consisting of pairs of homologous proteins with structurally determined sequence alignments are necessary for evaluating the efficacy of each scoring scheme. With such a benchmark, we have investigated the properties of profile–profile alignments and found that (1) with optimized gap penalties, most column–column scoring functions behave similarly to one another in alignment accuracy; (2) some functions, however, have much higher search sensitivity and specificity; (3) position-specific weighting schemes in determining amino acid counts in columns of multiple sequence alignments are better than sequence-specific schemes; (4) removing positions in the profile with gaps in the query sequence results in better alignments; and (5) adding predicted and known secondary structure information improves alignments...|$|R

In this work, we present a computational formalism for characterizing the compositional properties of the Type III secretion signal. While various rule sets derived from empirical observations have been suggested, developing a consistent and comprehensive description of the TTSS signal is still of interest. This problem differs from typical signal peptide classification and identification problems (e. g. - nuclear, chloroplast, mitochondrial signal peptides) because known TTSS substrates lack the similarity expected from signal sequences involved in a similar function (e. g. - from a multiple <b>alignment</b> <b>profile</b> or signal consensus sequence). Using a training set derived from empirically verified substrate sequences in Pseudomonas syringae, we apply divergence measures derived from information theory in order to classify similar patterns and characterize the Type III signal. The TTSS characterization developed in this work leads to a diffuse targeting signal confined to the first 50 amino acids starting from the N-terminus. Finally, using the P. syringae training set, the method is applied to verify and predict substrate candidates in other organisms possessing a TTSS. ...|$|E

The present study describes the development of a compu-tational method for predicting disordered proteins using sequence and profile compositions as input features for the training of SVM models. First, we developed the amino acid and dipeptide compositions based SVM modules which yielded sensitivities of 75. 6 and 73. 2 % along with Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) values of 0. 75 and 0. 60, respectively. In addition, the use of predicted secondary structure content (coil, sheet and helices) in the form of composition values attained a sensitivity of 76. 8 % and MCC value of 0. 77.

40|$|Abstract Background Methods of {{alignment}} masking, {{which refers}} to the technique of excluding alignment blocks prior to tree reconstructions, {{have been successful in}} improving the signal-to-noise ratio in sequence alignments. However, the lack of formally well defined methods to identify randomness in sequence alignments has prevented a routine application of alignment masking. In this study, we compared the effects on tree reconstructions of the most commonly used profiling method (GBLOCKS) which uses a predefined set of rules in combination with alignment masking, with a new profiling approach (ALISCORE) based on Monte Carlo resampling within a sliding window, using different data sets and alignment methods. While the GBLOCKS approach excludes variable sections above a certain threshold which choice is left arbitrary, the ALISCORE algorithm is free of a priori rating of parameter space and therefore more objective. Results ALISCORE was successfully extended to amino acids using a proportional model and empirical substitution matrices to score randomness in multiple sequence alignments. A complex bootstrap resampling leads to an even distribution of scores of randomly similar sequences to assess randomness of the observed sequence similarity. Testing performance on real data, both masking methods, GBLOCKS and ALISCORE, helped to improve tree resolution. The sliding window approach was less sensitive to different alignments of identical data sets and performed equally well on all data sets. Concurrently, ALISCORE is capable of dealing with different substitution patterns and heterogeneous base composition. ALISCORE and the most relaxed GBLOCKS gap parameter setting performed best on all data sets. Correspondingly, Neighbor-Net analyses showed the most decrease in conflict. Conclusions Alignment masking improves signal-to-noise ratio in multiple sequence alignments prior to phylogenetic reconstruction. Given the robust performance of <b>alignment</b> <b>profiling,</b> <b>alignment</b> masking should routinely be used to improve tree reconstructions.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the last}} decade, a {{significant}} improvement in detecting remote similarity between protein sequences has been made by utilizing <b>alignment</b> <b>profiles</b> in place of amino-acid strings. Unfortunately, no analytical theory is available for estimating the significance of a gapped <b>alignment</b> of two <b>profiles.</b> Many experiments suggest that the distribution of local profile-profile alignment scores is of the Gumbel form. However, estimating distribution parameters by random simulations {{turns out to be}} computationally very expensive. Results We demonstrate that the background distribution of profile-profile alignment scores heavily depends on profiles' composition and thus the distribution parameters must be estimated independently, for each pair of profiles of interest. We also show that accurate estimates of statistical parameters can be obtained using the "island statistics" for profile-profile alignments. Conclusion The island statistics can be generalized to profile-profile alignments to provide an efficient method for the alignment score normalization. Since multiple island scores can be extracted from a single comparison of two profiles, the island method has a clear speed advantage over the direct shuffling method for comparable accuracy in parameter estimates. </p...|$|R

While several approaches have been proposed to evaluate white matter coherency including fractional anisotropy and fiber tracking in diffusion-weighted imaging, few are available for standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here we present an image post-processing method for this purpose based on Fourier transform (FT) power spectrum. T 2 -weighted images were collected from 19 patients (10 relapsing-remitting and 9 secondary progressive MS) and 19 age- and gender-matched controls. Image processing steps included: computation, normalization, and thresholding of FT power spectrum; determination of tissue <b>alignment</b> <b>profile</b> and dominant alignment direction; and calculation of alignment complexity using a new measure named angular entropy. To test the validity of this method, we used a highly organized brain white matter structure, corpus callosum.

40|$|A major {{computational}} {{challenge in}} the genomic era is annotating structure/function to the vast quantities of sequence information that is now available. This problem {{is illustrated by the}} fact that most proteins lack comprehensive annotations, even when experimental evidence exists. We previously theorized that embedded-alignment profiles (simply "alignment profiles" hereafter) provide a quantitative method that is capable of relating the structural and functional properties of proteins, as well as their evolutionary relationships. A key feature of <b>alignment</b> <b>profiles</b> lies in the interoperability of data format (e. g., alignment information, physio-chemical information, genomic information, etc.). Indeed, we have demonstrated that the Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) are an informative M-dimension that is scored by quantitatively measuring the embedded or unmodified sequence alignments. Moreover, the information obtained from these alignments is informative, and remains so even in the "twilight zone" of sequence similarity (< 25 % identity). Although our previous embedding strategy was powerful, it suffered from contaminating alignments (embedded AND unmodified) and high computational costs. Herein, we describe the logic and algorithmic process for a heuristic embedding strategy named "Adaptive GDDA-BLAST. " Adaptive GDDA-BLAST is, on average, up to 19 times faster than, but has similar sensitivity to our previous method. Further, data are provided to demonstrate the benefits of embedded-alignment measurements in terms of detecting structural homology in highly divergent protein sequences and isolating secondary structural elements of transmembrane and ankyrin-repeat domains. Together, these advances allow further exploration of the embedded alignment data space within sufficiently large data sets to eventually induce relevant statistical inferences.

The profile is usually obtained from a well-conserved region in a multiple sequence <b>alignment.</b> The <b>profile</b> {{is in the form}} of a matrix with each column representing a position in the alignment and each row one of the amino acids. Matrix values give the likelihood of each amino acid at the corresponding position in the <b>alignment.</b> The <b>profile</b> is moved along the target sequence to locate the best scoring regions by a dynamic programming algorithm. Gaps are allowed during matching and a gap penalty is included in this case as a negative score when no amino acid is matched. A sequence profile may also be represented by a hidden Markov model, referred to as a profile HMM.|$|R

Several methods have been proposed for predicting the bonding state of cysteines, either using local context or using global protein descriptors. In this paper we introduce an SVM based predictor that operates in two stages. The first stage is a multi-class classifier that operates at the protein level, using either standard Gaussian or spectrum kernels. The second stage is a binary classifier that refines the prediction by exploiting local context enriched with evolutionary information in the form of multiple <b>alignment</b> <b>profiles.</b> At both stages, we enriched profile encoding with information about cysteine conservation. The prediction accuracy of the system is 85 % measured by 5 -fold cross validation, on a set of 716 proteins from the September 2001 PDB Select dataset...|$|R
40|$|In {{telecare}} adoption, {{the lack}} of a strategic vision and of consistency in design choices have been identified as critical problems. Existing IS alignment literature only offers limited answers to these problems and does not acknowledge the different value configurations that telecare technology can enable. This paper, therefore, integrates work on strategic value configurations with the strategic IS alignment model in order to widen the latter's applicability. Based on the value configurations and related service management literature, a framework involving three distinct alignment configurations is developed for telecare. An analysis of two Dutch telecare projects shows how the proposed <b>alignment</b> <b>profiles</b> can explain the contrasting project outcomes more effectively than the traditional strategic alignment model would have done. The discussion reflects on the generalizability and contribution of an extended strategic alignment model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
