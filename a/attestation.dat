50|$|Historically, one of {{the criticisms}} of the H-1B regime had been that, even though {{applicants}} were required to make particular <b>attestations</b> in their Labor Condition Applications, {{there were very few}} penalties for those who lied or misrepresented facts in their <b>attestations.</b> ACWIA sought to correct their perceived problem by laying out explicit penalties, in addition to the extra <b>attestations</b> required by Section 412.|$|R

5|$|Grimal and Hayes further equate Sheshi with Sharek, a king {{whose sole}} <b>attestation</b> is {{found on a}} stone slab {{detailing}} the genealogy of Ankhefensekhmet, a priest who lived {{at the end of}} the 22nd Dynasty c. 750 BC, some 900 years after Sheshi's estimated lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the canons of Dunblane with the {{responsibility}} of selecting a successor. Bishop Nicholas had died sometime between 1306 (after his last <b>attestation</b> on 26 January) and late 1307. The election was done by compromissarii (a short-list of canons delegated to perform election), with John, Abbot of Arbroath excluded from the vote, perhaps because of his known pro-English tendencies.|$|E
5|$|No {{historical}} <b>attestation</b> of Sheshi {{is known}} for certain. Sheshi is absent from the Turin canon, a list of kings written on papyrus during the Ramesside period and which serves as the primary historical source for the second intermediate period. This is because {{the section of the}} papyrus covering the 13th to 17th Dynasties is heavily damaged and the problem of Seshi's chronological position cannot be resolved from the document.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} <b>attestations</b> {{are needed}} for LCAs filed by a H-1B-dependent employer filing for a non-exempt H-1B nonimmigrant. Even though H-1B-dependence is a global designation applied to the company, the assertion made by the <b>attestations</b> differs based on the specific position in which the worker is being employed. Therefore, an employer who can truthfully make the <b>attestations</b> for one type of worker (such as software engineer) {{may be unable to}} do so for another type of worker (such as manager). For positions where no H-1B workers are being hired, {{there is no need to}} meet the criteria for these <b>attestations</b> even if the employer is H-1B-dependent.|$|R

5|$|Robert {{held the}} office of Dean of York from at least 1147, but may have {{occupied}} the office as early as 1142. He may have been still alive as late as 1157, as it is possible he was the addressee of {{a letter from the}} papacy in January 1157. His last secure <b>attestation</b> as dean is in October 1154. Although Keats-Rohan states in Domesday Descendants that Robert was also Archdeacon of York, he is not so listed in the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae under any of the archdeaconries.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>attestation</b> of the Latin term is {{attributed}} to a charter of Duke Trpimir from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved, leading to doubts over {{the authenticity of the}} claim. The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm. The inscription is not believed to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879–892, during Branimir's rule.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early <b>attestation</b> of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor <b>attestation</b> of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E
5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent <b>attestation,</b> the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E
5|$|Alfred John Shout {{was born}} in Wellington, New Zealand, on 8 August 1882. He was the eldest of nine {{children}} to an English-born father, John Richard Shout, and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (née Kelly, formerly McGovern). Information on Alfred Shout's early life is rather scant and the details differ between sources, but according to his First World War <b>attestation</b> form he was privately educated. In early 1900, Shout travelled to South Africa with his elder half-brother, William McGovern. The brothers sought to join one of the colonial contingents then engaged in the Second Boer War; Alfred enlisted in the newly raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (using the surname Shout) found a place in Bethune's Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was an irregular colonial force formed in eastern Cape Colony, and Shout was allotted to the unit's No.1 Company with the service number 9216.|$|E

5|$|Siward can {{be found}} {{witnessing}} numerous charters during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A Dux ("earl") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two charters in 1050, {{and this may be}} Siward. There is another <b>attestation</b> in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at Lincoln—between Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.|$|E
5|$|Whether Neferhotep I usurped {{the throne}} {{at the expense}} of Sobekhotep III or {{inherited}} it, he possibly acceded to power over a fragmented Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This could explain why Neferhotep's only <b>attestation</b> in Lower Egypt is a single scarab seal. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt. Possible vindications of this are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and 4 scarab seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough power to maintain trade relations with this region.|$|E
5|$|If the Governor General of Canada {{is unable}} to give assent, {{it can be done}} by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not {{actually}} necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an <b>attestation.</b> In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons, whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.|$|E
