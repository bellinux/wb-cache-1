5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in <b>age</b> <b>from</b> Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.).

Children with language difficulty performed poorer than their normal age peers on the index as well. The index was validated against MLU and the two indices moderately correlated with each other. A linear combination of age, D and the index was entered into discriminant analysis, yielding a classification accuracy of 86. 7 % of all the children. The index {{was found to be}} a potentially useful clinical marker of SLI yet replication is needed to confirm the findings. Further modification of the index was discussed. The age and language growth sensitivity of MLU was discussed as well. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesBachelorBachelor of Science in Speech and Hearing Science...|$|R
