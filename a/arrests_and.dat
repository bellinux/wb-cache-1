This included raids on two branches of the Oasis bathhouses, known {{to be the most}} popular in Beijing. In 2000, police arrested 37 men in a Guangzhou gay spa on charges of prostitution. Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{political}} parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished. In its manifesto for the 2011 general election, the Workers' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws, which allow <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> detention without trial only under strict conditions, should be enacted to replace the ISA. The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013.|$|E

City of Lago Vista in 2001, holding that an arrest without a warrant, {{even for a}} misdemeanor, is lawful when authorized by statute.|$|E
5|$|Although Rome {{at first}} rejoiced at {{the demise of}} Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more {{extensive}} trials, as Tiberius persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. <b>Arrests</b> <b>and</b> executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro. The political turmoil continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.|$|E
5|$|During the 1941 {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustaša regime. The Ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews were subjected to mass <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad.|$|E

5|$|During the strike, Berkman {{organized}} {{demonstrations in}} New York {{in support of}} the miners. In May and June, he and other anarchists led several protests against John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The protests eventually moved from New York City to Rockefeller's home in Tarrytown, New York, and resulted in the beatings, <b>arrests,</b> <b>and</b> imprisonments of a number of anarchists. The strong police response to the Tarrytown protests led to a bomb plot by several Ferrer Center anarchists.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937 Heydrich {{directed}} the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing {{public opinion and}} report back their findings. He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches, <b>arrests,</b> <b>and</b> interrogations, thus in effect exercising control over public opinion. In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resisted Hitler's proposed merger with Germany, Heydrich intensified the pressure on Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna stressing the common Germanic blood of the two countries. In the Anschluss on 12 March, Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by the {{regional}} Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched {{a crackdown on}} the opposition that included conducting thousands of <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to dozens of deaths. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{assisted}} in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow oblast.

In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these <b>arrests,</b> <b>and</b> did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May, Morgan {{was in a}} {{position}} to advance in force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking advantage of the poor communications between the various elements of the insurgency. The uprising collapsed, and over the next few days the authorities regained control, making <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the railway introduced new tensions {{between the government and}} the First Nations. The authorities wished to move the indigenous peoples to reservations north of the railway in order to cut them off from the United States border. For their part, the First Nations were unhappy about the railway being built through their lands, stole company horses and disrupted the construction work. The mounted police made <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> the government reduced their rations: by 1883, the threat of starvation had forced the First Nations to relocate to the northern side of the line.|$|E
5|$|The prison barge was {{temporarily}} closed in August 1995 due to less crowded city jails, {{caused by a}} decline in <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> inmate transfers. In late 1996, the prison was slated for reopening due to the rise in arrests from a campaign targeting drugs and drug dealers. The six-month campaign expected more than seven thousand additional arrests than usual, but the ship was not reopened until 1998 when it {{was used by the}} Department of Juvenile Justice. The Bain Center is currently used as a processing facility for inmates in the Department of Corrections system. There are three other processing facilities that each handle specific boroughs.|$|E
