Although {{intended as a}} serial, no sequel was ever made; the production house, Batavia Motion Picture, closed soon afterwards.

5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water <b>as</b> <b>this</b> forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake {{tends to}} be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce.
