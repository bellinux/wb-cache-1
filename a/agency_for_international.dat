40|$|Abstract: {{this article}} {{is part of a}} PhD thesis {{interested}} in confronting the demands of Latin American law enforcement institutions with programs in the security sector reform fostered by foreign <b>agencies</b> <b>for</b> <b>international</b> assistance on the continent. The guiding hypothesis {{of this study is that}} programs of international aid focused on the security sector reform in Latin America overlook law enforcement demands for institutional strengthening. I suggest that the international offering in this area follows a regional agenda, which is basically preventive and is very resistant to work with law enforcement organizations. Part of the work is mapping donor and recipient countries for analyzing programs implemented in Latin American countries. This article presents the literature review for this investigation and the first results of our empiric research...|$|R

The main {{objective of this}} article is two-fold: first, to analyze the three sociopolitical factors that influenced the emergence of emigration policy at the state level, and second, to examine two strategic activities undertaken by state governments in the Central Western region. Public <b>agencies</b> <b>for</b> <b>international</b> migrants carry out various actions such as administering federal government programs, preserving regional identities, promoting human and civil rights for migrants, locating missing persons, and processing official documents. Many of these activities are complementary to those undertaken by federal government.
