40|$|Frequent, {{suboptimal}} use of antimicrobial drugs {{has resulted}} in the emergence of microbial resistance, compromised clinical outcomes and increased costs, particularly {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Mounting on these challenges is the paucity of new antimicrobial agents. Objectives: The study aims to determine the impact of prospective pharmacy-driven antimicrobial stewardship in the ICU on clinical and potential financial outcomes. The primary objectives were to determine the mean length of stay (LOS) and mortality rate in the ICU resulting from prospective pharmacy interventions on antimicrobial therapy. The secondary objective was to calculate the difference in total drug acquisition costs resulting from pharmacy infectious diseases (ID) -related interventions. Methods: In collaboration with an infectious disease physician, the ICU pharmacy team provided prospective audit with feedback to physicians on antimicrobial therapies of 70 patients over a 4 -month period in a 31 -bed ICU. In comparison with published data, LOS and mortality of pharmacy-monitored ICU patients were recorded. Daily cost savings on antimicrobial drugs and charges for medication therapy management (MTM) services were added to calculate potential total cost savings. Pharmacy interventions focused on streamlining, dose optimization, intravenous-to-oral conversion, antimicrobial discontinuation, new recommendation and drug information consult. Antimicrobial education was featured in oral presentations and electronic newsletters for pharmacists and clinicians. Results: The mean LOS in the ICU was 6 days, which was lower than the published reports of LOS ranging from 11 to 36 days. The morality rate of 14 % was comparable to the reported range of 6 to 20 % in published literature. The total drug cost difference was a negative financial outcome or loss of USD 192 associated with ID-related interventions. Conclusion: In collaboration with the infectious disease physician, prospective pharmacy intervention on antimicrobial therapy in the ICU led to positive clinical outcomes and an <b>additional</b> drug <b>cost</b> <b>expense</b> of USD 192...|$|R

We study a {{class of}} games in which {{a finite number of}} agents each {{controls}} a quantity of flow to be routed through a network, and are able to split their own flow between multiple paths through the network. Recent work on this model has contrasted the social cost of Nash equilibria with the best possible social cost. Here we show that <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> are incurred in situations where a selfish “leader ” agent allocates his flow, and then commits to that choice so that other agents are compelled to minimise their own cost based on the first agent’s choice. We find that even in simple networks, the leader can often improve his own <b>cost</b> at the <b>expense</b> of increased social cost. Focussing on the 2 -player case, we give upper and lower bounds on the worst-case <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> incurred. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} also {{available}} electronically at: [URL] {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the additional needs and associated financial costs of disability from the perspective of disabled people themselves. The research took place at a time when it is recognised that disabled people have a range of <b>additional</b> needs and <b>costs</b> (Large, 1991) and have a disproportionate risk of poverty (Gordon, et al., 2000). However, research to date has not provided a clear measure of these <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> (Berthoud, 1998). As a result, levels of nationally provided financial benefits and local services are predicated on limited evidence. Certain state benefits are meant to offset, at least partially, the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> associated with disability, but the extent to which these benefits meet <b>additional</b> needs and <b>costs</b> is unknown. Recently, ‘fairer charging’ policies for local authority domiciliary care have been introduced with the intention that service charges should take into account the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> that individuals incur because of disability. Clear guidance for determining these <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> is proving elusive. The central aim of this research was to provide clear evidence on the extent of these <b>additional</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R
