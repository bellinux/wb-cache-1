The act could not be justified on the basis that the directors honestly believed that {{it would be in the}} best interest of the company. The improper issuance of shares can only be made valid if the decision is ratified by the shareholders at a general meeting, with no votes allowed to the newly <b>issued</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} firms <b>issuing</b> new <b>shares</b> at higher discounts and hence with larger expected dividend increases, use their opportunities for earnings management {{in such a}} way that, by the year of a <b>share</b> <b>issue,</b> they report larger earnings in excess of current dividends than firms that <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> at lower discounts or that do not <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> at all. These excess earnings are useful to successful issuing firms in that they reinforce the buffer of retained earnings available for future dividend payments, thereby conveying credible information about the firm's ability to meet the expected dividend increase implied by the issue announcement. The empirical findings are consistent with this argument. Earnings management <b>Share</b> <b>issue</b> Dividend policy Market reaction...|$|R

40|$|Session 4 - Markets and Financial Stability 2 We {{propose that}} when a firm cross-lists in {{segmented}} markets, in pricing the second <b>issued</b> <b>share,</b> the first <b>issued</b> <b>share</b> price as a reference plays both an informational and anchoring role. We develop a model illustrating the dual-role and relating the anchoring bias to the IPO underpricing of the second <b>issued</b> <b>share.</b> Empirically, we examine a group of Chinese firms that first <b>issued</b> foreign <b>shares</b> and then domestic A-shares, in which the anchoring effect contributes to more A-share underpricing. The anchoring model predicts a positive association between differences in costs of capital and the A-share underpricing, and that this positive association is weaker when participants {{are less likely to}} resort to this anchoring heuristic or/and when the A-share valuation is less uncertain. Empirical results support our dual-role hypothesis. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 24 th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, Sydney, Australia, 14 - 16 December 2011, p. 1 - 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} empirical dividend model is that proposed by Lintner, who argued that firms smooth dividends over time. Many theoretical dividend models, however, either predict that dividends should be highly variable, or at least offer no support for the smoothing hypothesis. We use a switching regression model to test the Lintner model against an alternative which allows dividend behavior to differ depending upon whether or not firms are <b>issuing</b> <b>shares.</b> We reject the Lintner model, finding no evidence of dividend smoothing when firms are not <b>issuing</b> <b>shares,</b> and a high negative dividend growth rate when firms are <b>issuing</b> <b>shares.</b> This description of dividend behavior suggests {{the existence of a}} financing hierarchy in that the marginal source of finance differs over time. To further explore the financing hierarchy, we estimate logit models which explain the decisions by firms to change dividends, and to <b>issue</b> or repurchase <b>shares.</b> The results are consistent with the existence of a financing hierarchy. ...|$|R
