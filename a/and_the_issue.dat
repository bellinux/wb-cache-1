5|$|The Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) (Danish: Muhammedkrisen) {{began after}} the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 editorial cartoons on 30 September 2005, {{most of which}} depicted Muhammad, the principal figure of the religion of Islam. The newspaper announced {{that this was an}} attempt to contribute to the debate about criticism of Islam and self-censorship. Muslim groups in Denmark complained, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the Zapatista revolt {{gathered}} strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14, Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region. However, Zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time that Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the autonomy of Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla and the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside of his control.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward I died in 1307 {{he left a}} {{range of}} {{challenges}} for his son to resolve. One {{of the most critical}} was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E

5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who {{had the support of}} the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's territorial government, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo would {{have the right to}} increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a lawsuit, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an imperious manner towards franchisees, who it believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the Gator Bowl, media and fan {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's possible disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game, the coaching situations at the two schools, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{of whether or not}} Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football. After the Virginia Tech-Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6.5 points. The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began. There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl. In exchange for appearing in the game, the teams were guaranteed to split a payout of $3,313,610.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals as a minority government dependent upon the support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which {{would never have been}} possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 in an attempt to negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E
5|$|The Alversund Bridge was a toll bridge {{which was}} {{paying for the}} debt {{accumulated}} in its construction. By 1968, the debt would be paid off, but the Norwegian Public Roads Administration launched a plan whereby the tolls {{would continue to be}} collected and used to finance a bridge across Salhusfjorden. This was opposed by a group of locals, who brought the issue to the courts, claiming it to be illegal, as a bridge would never be built. Both Oslo District Court and Eidsivating Court of Appeal concluded that the tolls were legal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> was rejected by the Supreme Court. Protests were also raised against the use of a pontoon bridge, as it would limit the vessel size and thus the commercial development in the inner parts of the fjord.|$|E

5|$|The Triangle Link {{was passed}} by the various {{municipal}} councils in February and March 1988. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry, which connected to southern Bømlo, remain, but that the other four ferry services be terminated. During late 1989, advance tolling on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990. However, the start date was not supported by the national government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> placed on hold.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} tension between Norway and the Soviet Union became heated after Norway joined NATO in 1949. The Soviet Union issued memorandums to Norway stating that Svalbard {{could not be}} under a NATO joint command, but this was rejected by Norway, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> laid at rest. A new protest was issued in 1958 after Norsk Polar Navigasjon proposed building an private airport at Ny-Ålesund, which was then actively opposed by the Norwegian government in order to not agitate the Soviet Union. New protests were issued against {{the establishment of the}} European Space Research Organization's Kongsfjord Telemetry Station, although the protests did not stop construction. A compromise about a Norwegian civilian airport was reached in 1971 and Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened in 1975, serving both Soviet and Norwegian towns.|$|E
5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{as to how}} {{to treat}} the wider battlefields surrounding these monuments. At the end of the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but post-war reconstruction meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to the dead of Verdun, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of whether or not to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E

5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of declining birth rates allowed {{women to have}} some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although {{there has been an}} increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
5|$|With {{his good}} {{academic}} reputation, several staff members {{provided him with}} work as a tutor in Ancient History in the Department of Tutorial Classes, but he was prevented from doing so by the Chancellor of the University, Sir William Cullen, who feared that Childe would propagate socialism to students. This infringement of Childe's civil rights was condemned in the leftist community, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{was brought up in}} the Parliament of Australia by centre-left politicians William McKell and T.J. Smith. Moving to Maryborough, Queensland, in October 1918 Childe took up employment teaching Latin at the Maryborough Grammar School. Here too his political affiliations became known, and he was subject to an opposition campaign from local conservative groups and the Maryborough Chronicle, resulting in abuse from disobedient pupils. He soon resigned.|$|E
