25|$|There {{were some}} {{problems}} in Yggdra Union's development. One such situation was <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> {{that they would}} not be able to fit all of the data onto the cartridge, but Sting okayed the release of the game on a larger cartridge, alleviating any space problems. The largest problem was character design. Many different character designs were produced, but the creators of the game had difficulty agreeing on which ones to use.|$|E
25|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There {{are a number of}} anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder.|$|E
25|$|Assad himself {{sought to}} control the PLO and Lebanon. His anxieties were caused by <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> that Palestinian guerrilla {{activities}} would invite another Israeli invasion and that his minority Alawite regime would be endangered by the Sunni Palestinians. Initially, Syria encouraged its own Palestinian groups {{to compete in the}} process, facilitating the entrance of as-Sa'iqa, PFLP-GC, and the pro-Syrian dissident Fatah faction under Abu Musa. However, Syria's allies were only powerful in areas controlled by the Syrian Army, such as the Beqaa valley. In the areas beyond Syria's control, however, it soon became apparent that the independent Palestinian organizations Fatah, PFLP and DFLP had far stronger support.|$|E

25|$|Late in the war, as {{they got}} desperate, and as it became obvious to the Algarvians that non-Kaunians were now far more of <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> than the {{thoroughly}} cowed blonds, the Algarvians began to display a somewhat more pragmatic, open attitude toward the Kaunians. They allowed Valmierans and Jelgavans to join their army, and they {{played an important role}} on the southern front against the Unkerlanters and in Jelgava. Their mages still defaulted toward wanting to kill Kaunians out of habit, including the soldiers fighting on their side, but Algarvian officers increasingly refused to allow this, leading the mages to turn to killing Yaninan deserters or turning to other magics.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is one reason that he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E
25|$|Habib Bourguiba {{was officially}} born on August 3, 1903, in Monastir to Ali Bourguiba (1850–1925) and Fattouma Khefacha (1861–1913). Being their eighth and last child, his birth {{was a shame}} {{to his mother and}} <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> to his father, who {{conceived}} him in an advanced age. Born into a modest family, the young Habib was raised in a female environment and was marked by gender inequality. Despite his financial conditions, Ali Bourguiba decided to invest his money in the education of his son and therefore, avoid him his fate of being enrolled in the army. Likewise, he sent his son to Tunis, circa 1907, to live with his brother M'hamed, in order to study in elementary school of Sadiki. Separated from his mother at 5, he lived in modest conditions in the capital city, and the Jellaz Affair made a deep impression on him. In 1913, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires to the relief of his father, exempting him from military service and permitted him to pursue his secondary education in Sadiki. However, in the same year, he lost his mother at the age of 10, which marked his entire life.|$|E
5000|$|... "Worried Man Blues" [...] is a {{folk song}} in the roots music repertoire. It is cataloged as Roud Folk Song Index No. 4753. Like many folk songs passed by oral tradition, the lyrics vary from version to version, but {{generally}} all contain the chorus [...] "It takes <b>a</b> <b>worried</b> man to sing <b>a</b> <b>worried</b> song/It takes <b>a</b> <b>worried</b> man to sing <b>a</b> <b>worried</b> song/I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long." [...] The verses {{tell the story of}} a man imprisoned for unknown reasons [...] "I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep/When I woke up, had shackles on my feet", who pines for his lost love, who is [...] "on the train and gone." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{barometric}} stage was to delay activating the radar altimeter firing command circuit until near detonation altitude. A thin metallic membrane enclosing a vacuum chamber (a similar design is still used today in old-fashioned wall barometers) gradually deformed as ambient air pressure increased during descent. The barometric fuze was not considered accurate enough to detonate the bomb at the precise ignition height, because air pressure varies with local conditions. When the bomb reached the design height for this stage (reportedly [...] ), the membrane closed a circuit, activating the radar altimeters. The barometric stage was added because of <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> that external radar signals might detonate the bomb too early.|$|E
500|$|A {{possibility}} for Black {{is to develop}} his light-square bishop rapidly, by prioritising the moves b7–b6 and Bc8–b7 over castling and d7–d6. The game Solozhenkin–Stiazhkin (Leningrad 1990) continued with 9...b6 10.0-0 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Bb7 12.c5 bxc5 13.Qa5 d6 14.Bxe5 dxe5 15.Rfc1 and Moskalenko assesses this position as better for White; Lalic suggests that 13...Ng6 is an improvement. In the game Gausel–Reite (Norwegian Team Championship 1991), after the same 9.Be2 b6 10.0-0 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Bb7 Black introduced a highly original plan by avoiding the natural advance d7–d6, and instead blocked a white c5-push by playing ...c5 himself. The game continued 12.Qc3 f6 13.b4 c5!? and Lalic was [...] "deeply impressed by this plan, which really spoils all of White's fun". The c4-pawn is never allowed to advance, so that the Be2 is durably restricted. The Bf4 is obstructed by the Ne5, that cannot be easily removed. The weakness of the d7-pawn is not <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> {{as it can be}} protected by Bb7–c6 if necessary.|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 2013, Higginbotham {{signed for}} Sheffield United on a six-month contract, {{and made his}} debut for the club against their South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers the same day. Former Stoke {{teammate}} and current Sheffield United teammate Dave Kitson {{played a part in}} Higginbotham's move to Bramall Lane, Higginbotham stated on his move to the club: [...] "I was getting ready to go back to Ipswich on Sunday but after speaking to Dave I was optimistic something would be sorted here and thankfully it was... I was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be happening here ... Dropping into League One isn't <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> for me because this is a club on the up and I didn't want to be stuck at Stoke just picking my money up because that isn't me" [...] On 18 June 2013, having made sufficient first-team appearances for Sheffield United, Higginbotham activated a clause in his contract to extend it for the following season.|$|E

500|$|Recording of {{the album}} began September 6, 2010, lasting for eleven weeks, each one {{focusing}} on a particular song, something Vig stated [...] "was good because each song kinda had its own life". The recordings started with Grohl's rhythm guitar and Taylor Hawkins' drumming to provide the foundations and see if both could [...] "lock in". Hawkins usually played for hours before he got [...] "a drum track I'd be proud of". Click tracks were used, but Vig {{said that there was}} not <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> for the drums to follow it exactly as they [...] "wanted it to groove" [...] and [...] "we realized that when everything is off just a few milliseconds, the sound gets wider and thicker." [...] After the guitar and drum track, Mendel would play his basslines, which were practiced enough for them to be recorded perfectly on the first take. The following day, Shiflett and Smear would play guitars, with the latter being the last and usually being given a baritone guitar to have a different sound from the other guitarists. After the instrumental backing was ready, Grohl did the vocals either on the control room or the isolation booth. As Grohl wanted the songs [...] "to have maximum emotional potential", the vocals were screamed to the point he had headaches—"when the mic is picking up every tiny inconsistency, you really strain to make it sound right." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Lightning Bolt was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, stating that the band seemed more settled and comfortable while [...] "accentuating the big riffs and bigger emotions, crafting songs without <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> as to whether they're hip or not and, most importantly, enjoying the deep-rooted, nervy arena rock that is uniquely their own." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album four out of five stars, commenting that while [...] "some key sounds and sensibilities" [...] and uplifting lyrics were unlike Pearl Jam's earlier style, the music in Lightning Bolt marked a return to the [...] "thick-bottomed rhythms, hard-nosed guitars and darkened tone of classic Pearl Jam" [...] compared to predecessor Backspacer. Cole Waterman of PopMatters gave the album an eight out of ten, praising [...] "Pearl Jam thriving in their persona, building on what worked in the past without trying to copy it while adding new elements to the mix" [...] and feeling that despite [...] "the closing songs get monotonous in their united balladry", [...] "Future Days" [...] was a good album closer, comparing it to Tom Waits.|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

There are two types, one with and one without agoraphobia. Diagnosis is excluded by attacks due to a drug or medical condition, or by panic attacks that are better accounted for by other mental disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Whetstone {{may have}} been the {{location}} of a Soviet spy base. Tass, the Soviet news agency, had a radio monitoring station at The Lodge, 13 Oakleigh Park North, and the British security agencies became aware that it was being used to track its activities. [...] According to local newspapers, the diplomatic immunity granted to the Russians was <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> for the British government since it effectively granted a licence for Tass to publish libellous newsletters without the threat of prosecution.|$|E

[...] Often teenage children were left with a house and bank account for months, while the parents worked in Hong Kong. [...] This resulted in various social problems in schools, including <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> by police that such children {{were more likely to be}} drawn into gangs due to the lack of parental supervision.|$|E

The Court quoted Federalist No. 51’s argument that by giving voters control over dual sovereign governments “a double security arises to the rights of the people. [...] The different governments will control each other, at the same that each will be controlled by itself.” The Court concluded that allowing the Federal government to draft the police officers of the 50 states into its service would increase its powers far beyond what the Constitution intends.|$|E
2500|$|While {{expenditure}} was <b>a</b> <b>worry</b> for the Treasurer, as Secretary (from 1854), George Gabriel Stokes was {{preoccupied with}} the actual content of the Transactions and his extensive correspondence with authors over his thirty-one-years as Secretary took up {{most of his time}} beyond his duties as Lucasian Professor at Cambridge. Stokes was paramount in establishing a more formalised refereeing process at the Royal Society. [...] It was not until Stokes's Presidency ended, in 1890, that his influence over the journal diminished. The introduction of fixed terms for Society officers precluded subsequent editors from taking on Stokes's mantle, and meant that the Society operated its editorial practices more collectively than it had done since the mechanisms for it were established in 1752.|$|E
