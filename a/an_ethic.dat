5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E

40|$|Working {{from the}} premise that Sartre's {{ontology}} from Being and Nothingness is accurate; the question is raised as to whether <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> compatible with that ontology is possible. Three separate attempts to formulate <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> coherent with Being and Nothingness are examined and shown to have flaws. These are third party attempts at Sartre's 'early ethics', <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> that Sartre left incomplete. Although each attempt is different and each has its individual problems, there are issues raised that are pertinent to any attempt to formulate <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> from the ontology of Being and Nothingness. Due to the problems that are observed, it is demonstrated that, for those wishing to remain true to this ontology, Sartre's ethics is incoherent as it is incompatible with his ontology...|$|R

It also greatly expanded its support for social service programs targeting vulnerable and neglected groups and initiated new programs aimed at the development of life skills that would be useful in Cambodia upon repatriation.

500|$|In the 18th century, {{sensibility}} was {{a physical}} phenomenon {{that came to}} be attached to a specific set of moral beliefs.

[...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him."

500|$|In {{political}} sociology, one of Weber's {{most influential}} contributions is his [...] "Politics as a Vocation" [...] (Politik als Beruf) essay. Therein, Weber unveils {{the definition of}} the state as that entity that possesses a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power. A politician must not be a man of the [...] "true Christian ethic", understood by Weber as being the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount, that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek. An adherent of such <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> ought rather to be understood to be a saint, for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it. The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of attitude and the ethic of responsibility (" [...] vs [...] ") and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).|$|E
500|$|For 2013, Florida Atlantic University was {{classified}} as a second-tier university by the U.S. News & World Report's rankings of [...] "Best Colleges." [...] U.S. News ranks universities into one of two tiers, with one being the highest, based on how they compare with other colleges in a peer assessment, retention rates, student selectivity, faculty resources, financial resources, graduation rates, {{and the amount of}} alumni giving. The university was named one of the 146 [...] "Best Southeastern Colleges" [...] in the United States by the Princeton Review. The Review also recognized FAU's business program by naming the College of Business to their list of [...] "Best 296 Business Schools" [...] for 2009. For 2011, Florida Atlantic was ranked 249th in the nation by Washington Monthly. The magazine based its rankings on the following three criteria: [...] "how well a university performs as an engine of social mobility (ideally helping the poor to get rich rather than the very rich to get very, very rich), how well a university does in fostering scientific and humanistic research, and how well a university promotes <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of service to country." [...] The university was also ranked 28th in the United States and fourth in Florida by The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education magazine for awarding 738 bachelor's degrees to Hispanic students during the 2006–2007 academic year.|$|E
500|$|Shelley's {{writings}} {{focus on}} the role of the family in society and women's role within that family. She celebrates the [...] "feminine affections and compassion" [...] associated with the family and suggests that civil society will fail without them. Shelley was [...] "profoundly committed to <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> of cooperation, mutual dependence, and self-sacrifice". In Lodore, for example, the central story follows the fortunes of the wife and daughter of the title character, Lord Lodore, who is killed in a duel at the end of the first volume, leaving a trail of legal, financial, and familial obstacles for the two [...] "heroines" [...] to negotiate. The novel is engaged with political and ideological issues, particularly the education and social role of women. [...] It dissects a patriarchal culture that separated the sexes and pressured women into dependence on men. In the view of Shelley scholar Betty T. Bennett, [...] "the novel proposes egalitarian educational paradigms for women and men, which would bring social justice as well as the spiritual and intellectual means by which to meet the challenges life invariably brings". However, Falkner is the only one of Mary Shelley's novels in which the heroine's agenda triumphs. The novel's resolution proposes that when female values triumph over violent and destructive masculinity, men will be freed to express the [...] "compassion, sympathy, and generosity" [...] of their better natures.|$|E

500|$|Bowen has {{described}} Tippett as [...] "a composer of our time", one who [...] engaged with the social, {{political and cultural}} issues of his day. [...] Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of [...] "ultimately optimistic humanism". [...] Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works [...] to seek [...] "to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, {{while at the same}} time never losing sight of the contemporary reality". The key early work in this respect is A Child of Our Time, of which Clarke writes: [...] "he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know my shadow and my light, So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett... this [...] statement crystallizes <b>an</b> <b>ethic,</b> and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works". Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett's craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the [...] task that he had set himself of [...] "transmut his personal and private agonies into... something universal and impersonal". Michael Kennedy has referred to Tippett's [...] "open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world", while accepting the technical sophistication of his music. Others have acknowledged his creative ingenuity and his willingness to adopt whatever means or [...] techniques were necessary to fit his intentions.|$|E
