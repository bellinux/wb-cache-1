5|$|In 2005, Newsom {{pushed for}} a state law to allow {{communities}} in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The <b>animal</b> <b>control</b> agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) discovers a bat in the ceiling. It flies {{through the}} office, sending the {{employees}} scurrying for cover. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and {{is turning into}} a vampire. Jim calls <b>animal</b> <b>control,</b> but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5:00 passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith who continues {{to hide in the}} breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head.|$|E

Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E

It also funds a volunteer fire department which services Omak and nearby rural communities. The Omak Fire Department estimated that there were 312 service calls around 2012, of which 80 included fire emergencies, 105 emergency medical incidents, six hazardous conditions, 26 service calls and three calls related to excessive heat concerns.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and {{as far south as}} the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US Midwest and parts of the Northeast, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's Southern Tier and in central New York. In addition, bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March, 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by <b>animal</b> <b>control</b> authorities) in a parking garage in downtown Houston. By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state except Delaware.|$|E
