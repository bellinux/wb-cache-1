40|$|International audienceOnline kernel {{learning}} (OKL) is {{a flexible}} framework to approach prediction problems, since the large approximation space provided by reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces can contain an accurate function for the problem. Nonetheless, optimizing over this space is computationally expensive. Not only first order methods accumulate O(sqrt T) more loss than the optimal function, but {{the curse of}} kernelization results in <b>a</b> <b>O(t)</b> per step complexity. Second-order methods {{get closer to the}} optimum much faster, suffering only O(log(T)) regret, but second-order updates are even more expensive, with <b>a</b> <b>O(t</b> 2) per-step cost. Existing approximate OKL methods try to reduce this complexity either by limiting the Support Vectors (SV) introduced in the predictor, or by avoiding the kernelization process altogether using embedding. Nonetheless, as long as the size of the approximation space or the number of SV does not grow over time, an adversary can always exploit the approximation process. In this paper, we propose PROS-N-KONS, a method that combines Nystrom sketching to project the input point in a small, accurate embedded space, and performs efficient second-order updates in this space. The embedded space is continuously updated to guarantee that the embedding remains accurate, and we show that the per-step cost only grows with the effective dimension of the problem and not with T. Moreover, the second-order updated allows us to achieve the logarithmic regret. We empirically compare our algorithm on recent large-scales benchmarks and show it performs favorably...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA key {{challenge}} for ensuring self-organization capabilities in the Internet of things (IoT) is that wireless devices {{must be able}} to adapt to the network's unpredictable dynamics. In the lower layers of network design, this means the deployment of highly adaptive protocols capable of supporting large numbers of wireless " things " via intelligent interference mitigation and online power control. In view of this, we propose an exponential learning policy for throughput maximization in time-varying, dynamic IoT environments where interference must be kept at very low levels. The proposed policy is provably capable of adapting quickly and efficiently to changes in the network and relies only on locally available and strictly causal information. Specifically, if the transmission horizon T of a device is known ahead of time, the algorithm under study matches the performance of the best possible fixed policy in hindsight within an error margin of O(T − 1 / 2); otherwise, if the horizon is not known in advance, the algorithm still achieves <b>a</b> <b>O(T</b> − 1 / 2 log T) worst-case margin.

A survey of experimental evidences resulted the following conclusions: (<b>a)</b> <b>OT</b> facilitates both the reversal (intradimensional) shifts and nonreversal (extradimensional) shifts when subjects were older than 15 years of age, (b) OT facilitates reversal shifts but neither facilitates nor hinders nonreversal shifts when subjects were between three to nine years old, with few exceptions, (c) delay, as well as OT, facilitates shift learning, {{but there is some}} different mechanism operating in the facilitation of the two, and (d) although the shift performance of retardates might differ from that of normal children, retardates also learn reversal problems faster under OT condition than under the criterion ones.

40|$|Online {{time series}} change {{detection}} {{is a critical}} component of many monitoring systems, such as space and air-borne remote sensing instruments, cardiac monitors, and network traffic profilers, which continuously analyze observations recorded by sensors. Data collected by such sensors typically has a periodic component. Most existing time series change detection methods are not directly applicable to handle such data, either because they are not designed to handle periodic time series or because they cannot operate in an online mode. We propose an online change detection algorithm which can handle periodic time series. The algorithm uses a Gaussian process based non-parametric time series prediction model and monitors the difference between the predictions and actual observations within a statistical control chart framework to identify changes. A key challenge in using Gaussian process in an online mode is the need to solve a large system of equations involving the associated covariance matrix which grows with every time step. The proposed algorithm exploits the special structure of the covariance matrix and can analyze a time series of length T in O(T 2) time while maintaining <b>a</b> <b>O(T)</b> memory footprint, compared to O(T 4) time and O(T 2) memory requirement of standard matrix manipulation methods.

Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for identifying land use land cover changes using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data collected for an agricultural region in Iowa state, USA. Our algorithm is able to detect different types of changes in a NDVI validation data set (with ≈ 80 % accuracy) which occur due to crop type changes as well as natural disasters...|$|E

We investigated whether gut-tropic T cells that express the integrin 1427 and the chemokine receptor CCR 9 are required for OT. METHODSSkin delayed-type hypersensitivity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis were used to monitor OT in mice. To assess the role of receptors that mediate localization of lymphocytes to the gut (gut-homing receptors) in induction of OT, we studied CCR 922 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 and 2722 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 mice, and also blocked the 1427 ligand MAdCAM- 1 in wild-type mice. We used DEREG and Scurfy mice to assess the role of Foxp 3 + regulatory T (TREG) cells, and IL- 1022 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 and IL- 10 R 222 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 mice to examine the role of IL- 10, in induction of OT. RESULTSOT could not be induced in CCR 922 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 or 2722 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 mice, or when MAdCAM- 1 was blocked in wild-type mice, indicating that gut-homing receptors are required for oral tolerization. Consistent with the role of all-trans retinoic acid in inducing gut homing T cells, OT could not be induced in mice depleted of vitamin <b>A.</b> <b>OT</b> was rescued in CCR 922 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 mice following adoptive transfer of wild-type T cells, but not CCR 922 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 or 2722 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 T cells. Gut-homing T cells are therefore necessary and sufficient to induce OT. Wild-type TREG cells and IL- 10 were required to restore OT to CCR 922 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 mice, indicating that homing and functional differentiation of IL- 10 -producing TREG cells in the gut is required for OT. Conversely, transfer of CCR 922 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 or 2722 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 / 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019 T cells to wild-type mice partially inhibited OT. CONCLUSIONSExpression of CCR 9 and 1427 on T cells and their subsequent localization to the gut is required for induction of oral {{immunological tolerance}} in mice. Therapies designed to block gut-homing receptors might, under some conditions, interfere with normal tolerogenic mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa.

Estudo 1 : Traduzir, testar os princípios métricos de validade de conteúdo e de consistência interna do Youth Sport Value Questionnaire 2 (YSVQ- 2). Estudo 2 : Explorar as associações (relações) entre importantes variáveis dos valores do esporte (Status, Competência e Moral), clima motivacional (ao Ego e à Tarefa) e atitudes (Pró e Antissociais), a fim de avaliar a validade do Modelo Explicativo de Valores e Atitudes no Esporte (MEVAE) de Lee et al. (2008) em jovens de 12 a 19 anos que praticam esportes em projetos sociais no sul do Brasil. Estudo 3 : Testar a inclusão da variável de Coping no MEVAE, a fim de contribuir para explicar melhor os valores e atitudes em jovens de 12 a 19 anos que praticam esportes em projetos sociais no sul do Brasil. O Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul analisou e aprovou o presente estudo sob o número de protocolo 18. 193. Resultados do Estudo 1 : A fim de atender o primeiro objetivo da tese, inicialmente, procedeu-se uma tradução “duplo cego”. Posteriormente a este procedimento, três juízes avaliadores, examinaram o Inventário através de uma escala de clareza e pertinência. Os resultados (CVCt) foram satisfatórios e indicam que o IVEJ- 2 é válido sob o ponto de vista da Validade de Conteúdo (CVCt > 0, 80). Após a validação do conteúdo, um estudo piloto foi realizado e constatado os índices de fidedignidade do Inventário ( Status = 0, 711;  Competência = 0, 785;  Morais = 0, 738). A partir destas constatações foi possível realizar o segundo estudo da tese. Resultados do Estudo 2 : A amostra foi composta por 1. 125 jovens gaúchos (nm = 687; nf = 438) com idades entre 12 e 19 anos (X = 13, 80; dp = 0, 40), que praticam esportes em projetos sociais. Cinco instrumentos foram utilizados (QICV; IVEJ- 2; PMCSQ- 2; QAE- 16; ‘desejabilidade social’). Constatou-se, a partir dos resultados, que os valores são preditoras do clima motivacional. A associação dos valores com a ‘Orientação à Tarefa’ (OT) representa 19, 2 % da variância, ao passo que com a ‘Orientação ao Ego’ (OE) foi de 9, 8 %. Os ‘Valores de Status’ (VS) foi preditor positivo da OE e negativo da OT, e os ‘Valores de Competência’ (VC) e ‘Morais’ (VM) foram preditoras positivos da OT e negativos da OE. <b>A</b> <b>OT</b> foi preditora positiva das ‘Atitudes Pró-Sociais’ (23, 8 % da variância). A OE (positivamente) e <b>a</b> <b>OT</b> (negativamente) são preditoras das ‘Atitudes Antissociais’ (15, 8 % da variância). As correlações parciais revelaram que a influência dos VC e VM sobre as ‘Atitudes Pró-Sociais’ é mediada pela OT (p 0, 05). Resultado do Estudo 3 : O presente estudo utilizou a mesma amostra do estudo 2. Foi avaliada, além das mesmas variáveis do estudo anterior, a variável ‘Coping’. A partir da inclusão das variáveis de Coping no MEVAE, constatou-se que os valores (VS negativamente), as ‘Ações Agressivas’ (β negativo), ‘Negação’, ‘Ações Diretas’ e ‘Autocontrole’ (β positivos) são preditoras do clima OT (23, 7 % da variância; p 0, 05). Considera-se, a partir dos resultados obtidos no presente estudo que o Coping é um elemento {{fundamental}} a ser considerado no MEVAE no contexto do esporte social. Os resultados dos três estudos (artigos) indicam importantes contribuições para elucidar, a partir do modelo explicativo MEVAE, a relação dos Valores, Coping, Clima Motivacional e Atitudes de jovens que praticam esportes em projetos sociais. Values {{and attitudes}} of young people playing sport in programs for socially disadvantaged children {{is the subject of}} this study. So, were outlined three goals for the thesis that culminated in three studies. Study 1 : Translate, test the principles of metric content validity and internal consistency of the Youth Sport Value Questionnaire 2 (YSVQ- 2). Study 2 : To explore the associations (relationships) between important variables the values of sport (Status, Skill and Morale), motivational climate (the Ego and Task) and attitudes (Pro and antisocial), to assess the validity of the Explanatory Model Attitudes and Values in Sport (MEVAE) of Lee et al. (2008) for youth ages 12 to 19 who play sports in programs for socially disadvantaged children in southern Brazil. Study 3 : Testing the inclusion of variable MEVAE Coping in order to contribute to better explain the values and attitudes in youth ages 12 to 19 who play sports in programs for socially disadvantaged children in southern Brazil. The Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul has reviewed and approved this study under the protocol number 18. 193. Results of Study 1 : To meet the first objective of the thesis, we initially conducted a translation "double blind". Subsequent to this procedure, three judges evaluators examined the inventory across a range of clarity and relevance. The results (CVCt) were satisfactory, and indicate that IVEJ- 2 is valid from the point of view of content validity (CVCt> 0, 80). After content validation, a pilot study was conducted and verified the reliability indices Inventory ( Status = 0, 711;  Competence = 0, 785;  Moral = 0, 738). From these findings it was possible to perform the second study of the thesis. Results of Study 2 : The sample comprised 1125 young gauchos (nm = 687; nf = 438) aged between 12 and 19 years (X = 13, 80, SD = 0, 40), who play sports in programs for socially disadvantaged children. Five instruments were used (QICV; IVEJ- 2; PMCSQ- 2, QAE- 16; 'social desirability'). It was found, from the results, the values are predictors of motivational climate. The association of values with the 'Task Orientation' (OT) represents 19, 2 % of the variance, whereas with 'Ego Orientation' (OE) was 9, 8 %. The 'Status Values' (VS) was a predictor of positive and negative OE OT, and the 'Values of Competence' (VC) and 'Moral' (VM) were predictive of positive and negative OE OT. The OT was a positive predictor of 'Pro-Social Attitudes' (23, 8 % of variance). The OE (positively) and OT (negatively) predict the 'antisocial attitudes' (15, 8 % of variance). The partial correlations revealed that the influence of VC and VM on 'Pro-Social Attitudes' is mediated by OT (p 0, 05). Results of Study 3 : This study used the same sample of study 2. We evaluated in addition to the same variables in the previous study, the variable "Coping". From the inclusion of variables in Coping MEVAE, it was found that the values (VS negatively), the 'Aggressive Actions' (negative β), 'Denial', 'Direct Action' and 'Composure' (positive β) predict Climate OT (23, 7 % of the variance, p 0, 05). It is, from the results obtained in this study that the Coping is a key element to be considered in the context of MEVAE social sport. The results of the three studies (articles) indicate important contributions to elucidate, from MEVAE explanatory model, the relationship of Values, Coping, Motivational Climate and Attitudes of young people who play sports in programs for socially disadvantaged children...|$|E

An objective satellite-based OT detection product has been developed using 11 -micrometer infrared window (IRW) channel brightness temperatures (BTs) for the upcoming R series of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R) Advanced Baseline Imager. In this study, this method is applied to GOES- 12 IRW data and the OT detections are compared with radar data, severe storm reports, and severe weather warnings over the eastern United States. The goals {{of this study are}} to 1) improve forecaster understanding of satellite OT signatures relative to commonly available radar products, 2) assess OT detection product accuracy, and 3) evaluate the utility of <b>an</b> <b>OT</b> detection product for diagnosing hazardous convective storms. The coevolution of radar-derived products and satellite OT signatures indicates that <b>an</b> <b>OT</b> often corresponds with the highest radar echo top and reflectivity maximum aloft. Validation of OT detections relative to composite reflectivity indicates an algorithm false-alarm ratio of 16 %, with OTs within the coldest IRW BT range (less than 200 K) being the most accurate. A significant IRW BT minimum typically present with <b>an</b> <b>OT</b> is more often associated with heavy precipitation than a region with a spatially uniform BT. Severe weather was often associated with OT detections during the warm season (April September) and over the southern United States. The severe weather to OT relationship increased by 15 % when GOES operated in rapid-scan mode, showing the importance of high temporal resolution for observing and detecting rapidly evolving cloud-top features. Comparison of the earliest OT detection associated with a severe weather report showed that 75 % of the cases occur before severe weather and that 42 % of collocated severe weather reports had either <b>an</b> <b>OT</b> detected before <b>a</b> severe weather warning or no warning issued at all. The relationships between satellite OT signatures, severe weather, and heavy rainfall shown in this paper suggest that 1) when <b>an</b> <b>OT</b> is detected, the particular storm is likely producing heavy rainfall and/or possibly severe weather; 2) <b>an</b> objective <b>OT</b> detection product can be used to increase situational awareness and forecaster confidence that a given storm is severe; and 3) this product may be particularly useful in regions with insufficient radar coverage...|$|R
