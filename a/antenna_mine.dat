50|$|During {{the initial}} period of World War I, the British Navy used contact mines in the English Channel {{and later in}} {{large areas of the}} North Sea to hinder patrols by German {{submarines}}. Later, the American <b>antenna</b> <b>mine</b> was widely used because submarines could be at any depth from the surface to the seabed. This type of mine had a copper wire attached to a buoy that floated above the explosive charge which was weighted to the seabed with a steel cable. If a submarine's steel hull touched the copper wire, the slight voltage change caused by contact between two dissimilar metals was amplified and detonated the explosives.|$|E
50|$|In World War II the Accentor-class {{minesweeper}} {{was used}} to find five different types of mines. First is naval mines. This type of mine was covered in pressure sensors called detonating horns that detonated when a ship's pressure wave hits it. Second is the army mine. Army mines were remotely detonated by troops on land. The next is the <b>antenna</b> <b>mine</b> that has a copper wire to detect the magnetic field of a passing ship. Then there was leon mine which has a battery-powered motor that moves it up and down. It will detonate when it hits a ship. Lastly there are sonic mines that are detonated by the noise made by the engines of a passing ship. To sweep for these mines, the Accentor-class minesweepers used a complicated system that consisted of about 150 feet of wire line, a depressor, a cutter, an otter, and a float. The float sits {{on the surface of}} the water and is used to pull the end of the wire line out to the side of the ship to increase the area that the mine sweeper could sweep and not just have the system drag behind the ship. It uses a fixed rudder to set the angle that the float is from the ship, and since the float is on the end of the line this is also the angle that the line is from the ship. The float is connected to the otter by the line. The otter is like a metal kite that sweeps thirty feet under water. Next on the line is the cutter which cuts the cable that connects the mine to the mine anchor. Next is the depressor. The depressor {{was used to}} pull the line down to thirty feet underwater so that the mines would get caught on the line and the forward motion of the ship would drag the mine to the cutter. This was attached to the minesweeper by a pulley and winch system that allowed the ship to control the distance that the otter was from the ship. One of the problems with the Accentor-class minesweeper is that its small size made it difficult to get across oceans unless the weather was good. The minesweeper could get across an ocean, but it had to be scheduled around bad weather. The Accentor-class minesweepers were primarily meant to be used to locate mines that were in Allied water. This mines could include mines placed by Allied military for protecting harbors. Mines were placed so that the enemy was denied access to Allied coastal waters and harbors. This is called defensive mining. Offensive mining is used to close the coast of an enemy and the enemyâ€™s harbors to their ships.|$|E
5000|$|United States {{participation}} in the minesweeping effort was overseen by Rear Admiral Strauss aboard the repair ship Blackhawk from which he had commanded the minelaying operation. Tugs [...] and [...] towed Admiralty wooden sailing smacks Red Rose and Red Fern out to conduct the first trial sweep in December. Sweeping was accomplished by suspending a serrated wire between two ships on a parallel course. While held underwater by planing devices called [...] "kites", the wire would foul the cables suspending the buoyant mines above their anchors. If the serrated wire parted the mine mooring cable, the mine would bob to the surface to be destroyed by gunfire. The smacks swept and destroyed six mines before winter weather halted further work at sea. The winter was spent testing an electrical protective device {{to reduce the risk}} of sweeping the <b>antenna</b> <b>mines</b> with steel-hulled ships. Patapsco and Patuxent tested the protective device by sweeping 39 mines in March. [...] Royal Navy minesweeping efforts involved 421 vessels manned by 600 officers and 15,000 men from 1 April to 30 November 1919.|$|R
5000|$|The Mk 6 {{mine was}} a 34 in {{diameter}} steel sphere containing a buoyancy chamber and 300 lb of TNT. [...] Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast {{into the lower}} hemisphere. Toxyl {{was a mixture of}} 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. [...] For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped steel anchor approximately 30 in square. The anchor box had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its 800 lb anchor box by a wire rope mooring cable stored on a reel. [...] The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel mooring cable to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the cable reel so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the <b>antenna</b> above the <b>mine.</b> [...] Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its mooring cable and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the buoyancy chamber unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than 25 ft.|$|R
40|$|Part Two of {{this report}} is based upon six working memoranda {{prepared}} {{during the first half}} of 1972 at an early stage in our work for the Bureau of Mines. This work presents preliminary performance estimates of baseband voice and narrowband through-the-earth electromagnetic communications systems of principal interest to the Bureau for operational/ emergency mine communications applications. The calculations were prepared to obtain early indications of the feasibility and governing parameters of such communications systems. They are based on limited, but pertinent, coal mine electromagnetic noise data acquired to-date by Bureau of Mines contractors; on theoretical signal-attenuation characteristics for two transmitter antenna types of present interest to the Bureau and on semi-empirical models which describe the intelligibility of voice communications as a function of the frequency variations of the signal-to-noise ratio across the voiceband. This work examines the cases of baseband voice and narrowband communications for uplink and downlink transmissions, for frequencies up to 3 kHz. Downlink transmissions are via a horizontal wire antenna, and uplink transmissions via a vertical-axis loop <b>antenna,</b> for typical <b>mine</b> depths of 300, 600, and 1000 feet. Representative coal-mine overburden conductivities of 10 - 2 mhos/meter (moderate and common) and 10 - 1 mhos/ meter (high) were used; the former figure for both voice and narrowband calculations and the latter for narrowband calculations only. Examples of high, moderate, and low, surface and subsurface, harmonic and broadband-impulsive noise conditions were taken from NBS and Westinghouse (WGL) mine noise data, together with examples of high- and low-levels of ELF atmospheric noise taken from M. I. T. Lincoln Laboratory data. The effects of simple voice spectrum shaping techniques on the intelligibility of through-the-earth voice communications are examined, and indexes of intelligibility more broadly based than signal-to-noise ratio are discussed. Finally, a means of overcoming the affects of 60 Hz noise and its harmonics which are the largest contributors to typical audio frequency in-mine noise, is suggested. These feasibility calculations are not intended to serve as definitive and complete treatments, but as a starting point: to establish first-order estimates of the magnitude and variability of transmitter power requirements under different noise, overburden conductivity, and mine depth conditions; to identify relationships, conditions, or frequencies that are likely to limit or enhance system performance; to reveal items requiring further investigation and data still required; and to suggest practical methods for optimizing system performance. These objectives were met by the calculations. Simple experiments to support these calculations can and should be carried out; together with more detailed investigations of specific modulation, coding, noise-suppression, voice-compression and signal-conditioning techniques, aimed at producing through-the-earth operational/emergency mine-communication systems that are not only effective, but practical and economically sound...|$|R
