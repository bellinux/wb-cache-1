5|$|Structural <b>alignments</b> {{can compare}} two {{sequences}} or multiple sequences. Because these <b>alignments</b> rely on information {{about all the}} query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. Structural <b>alignments</b> are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts, {{and they can be}} used as comparison points to evaluate <b>alignments</b> produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E

We discuss the use of fabricated structures on wafer surfaces to mechanically achieve higher <b>alignment</b> accuracy than can be achieved with our existing (baseline) <b>alignment</b> protocol. The keyed <b>alignment</b> structures rely on structures with tapered side-walls that can slide into each after two wafers are “pre-aligned” using our baseline <b>alignment</b> protocol.

5|$|The way demons behave {{is based}} on their and the protagonist's {{respective}} <b>alignments.</b> <b>Alignments</b> come in two types, Light-Neutral-Dark, and Law-Neutral-Chaos. A demon's alignment can range across both <b>alignments,</b> resulting in nine possible stances that affect how they behave and what actions in battle or story progression pleases them. The protagonist's alignment changes depending on choices made during the story, and in response the attitudes of people and demons change; for instance, demons who are law-aligned will refuse to form an alliance with chaos-aligned players. Additionally, depending on their alignment, players will not be let into certain areas; for instance, the Order of Messiah will not let chaos-aligned players into their churches.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} can negotiate {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be fused together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which take inspiration from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main <b>alignments</b> govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, neutral and dark alignments; and one representing law, neutral and chaos <b>alignments.</b> The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether they will remain loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. Fused demons can be shared between players using thirty-two character passwords generated when a new demon is fused. These passwords can be traded between different players.|$|E

40|$|Explaining {{the effect}} of {{information}} technology (IT) on organizational performance is a primary concern for strategic IT <b>alignment</b> research. The central hypothesis is that performance {{is a function of}} the <b>alignment</b> between IT and the organization’s business strategy. Preceding theories explain the performance implications of IT <b>alignment</b> within a single line of business. However, they do not explain the need for IT to be aligned with distinct strategies developed at the corporate and strategic business unit (SBU) levels in a multi-business organization. This thesis begins the task of unpacking the concept of IT <b>alignment</b> to explain the performance implications of different types of IT <b>alignment</b> within multi-business organizations. The thesis extends the literature by developing a new conceptualization of IT <b>alignment</b> in multi-business organizations and developing a novel theory of IT <b>alignment</b> in these organizations. In particular, it proposes that IT <b>alignment</b> can be conceived of as a family of constructs to accommodate three distinct <b>alignment</b> phenomena: corporate IT <b>alignment,</b> which refers to <b>alignment</b> at the corporate level, SBU IT <b>alignment,</b> which refers to <b>alignment</b> at the SBU level, and cross-level IT <b>alignment,</b> which refers to <b>alignment</b> between the corporate and SBU levels. Then, the thesis develops and tests a theory of the performance implications of cross-level IT <b>alignment</b> and SBU IT <b>alignment</b> in multi-business organizations. The primary contribution of this thesis is to unpack IT <b>alignment</b> to explain how different types of IT <b>alignment</b> jointly affect the performance of multi-business organizations. Hypotheses are tested using data collected in a survey of one hundred and seven multi-business organizations in the US, Germany, and Australia. The results show that cross-level IT <b>alignment</b> is a significant enabler of SBU agility and performance. Further, the thesis shows that cross-level IT <b>alignment</b> facilitates SBU IT <b>alignment,</b> which in turn, enhances SBU agility and performance. This thesis contributes to research by showing that there is a link between different types of IT <b>alignment</b> in multi-business organizations and that they are complementary determinants of the performance of SBUs. It extends the understanding of IT <b>alignment</b> challenges facing practitioners in multi-business organizations and provides a platform for further inquiry...|$|R

5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} <b>alignments</b> {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence <b>alignments,</b> it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E
