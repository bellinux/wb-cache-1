40|$|There {{is a great}} {{challenge}} in combining soil proximal spectra and remote sensing spectra to improve the accuracy of soil organic carbon (SOC) models. This is primarily because mixing of spectral data from different sources and technologies to improve soil models {{is still in its}} infancy. The first objective {{of this study was to}} integrate information of SOC derived from visible near-infrared reflectance (Vis-NIR) spectra in the laboratory with remote sensing (RS) images to improve predictions of topsoil SOC in the Skjern river catchment, Denmark. The second objective was to improve SOC prediction results by separately modeling uplands and wetlands. A total of 328 topsoil samples were collected and analyzed for SOC. Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT 5), Landsat Data Continuity Mission (Landsat 8) images, laboratory Vis-NIR and other <b>ancillary</b> environmental <b>data</b> including terrain parameters and soil maps were compiled to predict topsoil SOC using Cubist regression and Bayesian kriging. The results showed that the model developed from RS <b>data,</b> <b>ancillary</b> environmental <b>data</b> and laboratory spectral data yielded a lower root mean square error (RMSE) (2. 8 %) and higher R 2 (0. 59) than the model developed from only RS data and ancil...|$|R

The combination of automatic data screening and manual flagging by an expert in at least daily frequency in close collaboration with a local station operator is the most recognizedway to detect impacts on measurement data and paves the way for post-correcting data treatment where necessary and reasonable. This is the preferred and recommended procedure, resulting in highestdata quality.

This standard doesn't merely adjust EAV and SAV timing {{to meet the requirements}} of the lower-bitrate formats; instead, it provides a means by which an entire SDI format (including synchronization words, <b>ancillary</b> <b>data,</b> and video payload) can be encapsulated and transmitted as ordinary data payload within a 292M stream.|$|E
