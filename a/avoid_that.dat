For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.|$|E

5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, but what was not clear was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E
25|$|Both the Roman and Chinese traditions {{typically}} show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally {{backed with}} a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used, as in the example illustrated, {{to bridge the gap between}} a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists. The Chinese style generally showed only a distant view, or used dead ground or mist to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> difficulty.|$|E

Once again, the {{situation}} was not settled until Turkey threatened to invade {{on the basis that}} it would be protecting the Turkish population from ethnic cleansing by Greek Cypriot forces. To <b>avoid</b> <b>that,</b> a compromise was reached for Greece to be forced to remove some of its troops from the island; for Georgios Grivas, EOKA leader, to be forced to leave Cyprus and for the Cypriot government to lift some restrictions of movement and access to supplies of the Turkish populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{design and}} {{maintenance}} procedures of all systems involved methods to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> subscribers experienced undue {{changes in the}} quality of the service or that they noticed failures. A variety of tools referred to as make-busys were plugged into electromechanical switch elements upon failure and during repairs. A make-busy identified the part being worked on as in-use, causing the switching logic to route around it. A similar tool was called a TD tool. Delinquent subscribers had their service temporarily denied (TDed). This was effected by plugging a tool into the subscriber's office equipment on Crossbar systems or line group in step-by-step switches. The subscriber could receive calls but could not dial out.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 he {{dissolved}} the Cortes (parliament), {{which cost}} Alcalá-Zamora critical {{support on the}} part of the left. The subsequent elections of November 1933 gave victory to the right, to which Alcalá-Zamora was very hostile, with constant institutional confrontations throughout its term in office. The party with the highest number of votes was the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas (CEDA), but it did not have enough seats to govern on its own. Alcalá-Zamora refused to appoint CEDA leader José María Gil-Robles prime minister and instead appointed Alejandro Lerroux, who then cooperated with the CEDA. In October 1934 Gil-Robles obtained two ministerial portfolios for CEDA; the following March he acquired three more, though at first he stopped short of trying to obtain the office of Prime Minister. When in the end he decided to try for that post, Alcala-Zamora dissolved the Cortes (7 January 1936) specifically to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> outcome.|$|E

25|$|Bettino Craxi {{had visited}} Algeria in November 1984, being warned by the {{president}} Chadli Benjedid that Algeria was ready to invade that region of Tunisia that was crossed by the pipeline towards Italy, if Bourguiba wasn't able to guarantee the stability of his own country. Algeria was trying to diversify its foreign policy, feeling isolated by Spain and by Mitterrand's accord with Morocco and Libya over Chad. For two years, according to Martini, Italian and Algerians secret services worked together in order, on one hand, to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> the growing destabilization of Tunisia might spillover in Algeria, {{and on the other}} hand to control pro-Palestinian terrorist activities in Italy. Finally, Ben Ali was singled out as possible replacement for Bourguiba: as chief of the Tunisian secret services and as Minister of Interiors, he had opposed plans for rough justice execution of fundamentalists. SISMI's action did not have the consent of René Imbot, head of the French secret service, and the United States were not informed.|$|E

Though Hosseini did not consciously decide to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> topic, he stated that he was glad that he had moved away from {{it in order to}} keep the storyline fresh. The characters' struggles were largely personal and unrelated to the political turmoil in Afghanistan. Hosseini added, [...] "I hope a day will come when we write about Afghanistan, where we can speak about Afghanistan in a context outside of the wars and the struggles of the last 30 years. In some way I think this book is an attempt to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{also argued}} that [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] and trilogy episodes in general are an excuse for the series' writers to not {{have to come up}} with new stories for the characters. [...] "It's {{understandable}} that after eleven years, a show might have trouble continuing to come up with original material for the same five characters, but the anthology episodes come across as rather transparent attempts to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> challenge", he wrote. On the other hand, DVD Verdict's Mac MacEntire argued that [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] is one of the season's best episodes. He wrote that the episode is [...] "filled with great gags", including the hobo's sponge bath and Bart and Nelson's discussion about [...] "backtacks" [...] and [...] "tackbacks".|$|E

The stadium received new floodlights, which were bought used from Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo for NOK5 million. However, there were some initial complaints from Bodø Airport as the lights were a distraction for pilots. The club also considered installing artificial turf, and applied to be UEFA's partner to receive a grant to install a pilot turf, but this was instead awarded to Eyravallen in Sweden.

500|$|To {{encourage}} exploration, the Magnum Opus can be upgraded {{with materials}} scavenged from the desert, by hijacking enemies' cars or collecting their car parts. An enemy can jump {{on top of}} the Magnum Opus to make it explode, but the player can <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> by surrounding the car with hazards such as spikes. The player can access the garage screen throughout the game, allowing them to customize the Magnum Opus. Max's garage can change and modify the car's engine, chassis, wheels, body work, paint job, and its [...] "shell". Upgrading one aspect of the car will negatively affect other aspects; upgrading the engine will allow Max to drive faster, but handling will be more difficult. The sound produced by the engine changes when players change, add, or remove parts of the Magnum Opus. Max, his armor, and weapons are customizable; the player can unlock new skills and upgrades for him as he progresses through the game and earns experience points. Max is also customizable, with his clothing, appearance, fighting skills, and weapons being modifiable. Griffa, a wasteland wanderer, also offers Max tokens which can be used to upgrade his abilities.|$|E
500|$|After {{being placed}} in {{detention}} together, Lana and Sky came {{to know each other}} better. They gradually formed a bond, and Lana developed feelings for Sky. Lana's crush on Sky eventually culminated in Neighbours first lesbian kiss. The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in its usual 6.30pm G-rated timeslot. The executive producer of Neighbours, Ric Pellizzeri, said the storyline reflected reality and continued the show's move toward more contemporary issues. Pellizzeri explained that Neighbours was simply telling [...] "a story about tolerance." [...] The producer added that the kiss was as far as they would go, but the writers would not be discouraged from telling other stories about homosexuality in the future. On-screen, Sky told Lana that she was only interested in her boyfriend, but they remained friends. With her main storyline completed, Lana was seen attending the prom with a female admirer, before moving to Canada with her family. Script producer Luke Devenish told a reporter for the Sydney Star Observer, [...] "There is that great tradition that the lesbian is always dead in the final scene, and we were very aware of that as we were writing her out. We wanted to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> at all costs." ...|$|E
500|$|The skin of many frogs {{contains}} mild {{toxic substances}} called bufotoxins {{to make them}} unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the parotoid glands, located {{on the sides of}} their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. If the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. If the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to <b>avoid</b> <b>that</b> species in future. Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as aposematism. The poison dart frogs in the family Dendrobatidae do this. They are typically red, orange, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings on their bodies. Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators. [...] Other species, such as the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina), have their warning colour underneath. They [...] "flash" [...] this when attacked, adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies.|$|E
