40|$|Abstract Background Germline {{and somatic}} inactivating {{mutations}} in the HRPT 2 gene {{occur in the}} inherited hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, in some cases of parathyroid cancer {{and in some cases}} of familial hyperparathyroidism. HRPT 2 encodes parafibromin. To identify parafibromin interacting proteins we used the yeast two-hybrid system for screening a heart cDNA library with parafibromin as the bait. Results Fourteen parafibromin interaction positive preys representing 10 independent clones encoding actinin- 2 were isolated. Parafibromin interacted with muscle alpha-actinins (actinin- 2 and actinin- 3), but not with non-muscle alpha-actinins (actinin- 1 and actinin- 4). The parafibromin-actinin interaction was verified by yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of parafibromin interacted with <b>actinins.</b> In actin sedimentation assays parafibromin did not dissociate skeletal muscle <b>actinins</b> from actin filaments, but interestingly, parafibromin could also bundle/cross-link actin filaments. Parafibromin was predominantly nuclear in undifferentiated proliferating myoblasts (C 2 C 12 cells), but in differentiated C 2 C 12 myotubes parafibromin co-localized with <b>actinins</b> in the cytoplasmic compartment. Conclusion These data support a possible contribution of parafibromin outside the nucleus through its interaction with <b>actinins</b> and actin bundling/cross-linking. These data also suggest that <b>actinins</b> (and actin) participate in sequestering parafibromin in the cytoplasmic compartment. </p...|$|R

50|$|Alpha-actinin 2 is a 103.8 kDa protein {{composed}} of 894 amino acids. Each molecule is rod-shaped (35 nm in length) and it homodimerizes in an anti-parallel fashion. Each monomer has an N-terminal actin-binding region {{composed of}} two calponin homology domains, two C-terminal EF hand domains, and four tandem spectrin-like repeats form the rod domain in the central region of the molecule. The high-resolution crystal structure of human alpha-actinin 2 at 3.5 Å was recently resolved. Alpha <b>actinins</b> belong to the spectrin gene superfamily which represents {{a diverse group of}} actin-binding cytoskeletal proteins, including spectrin, dystrophin, utrophin and fimbrin. Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to the Z-disc and analogous dense bodies, where they help anchor the myofibrillar actin filaments. Alpha-actinin 2 has been shown to interact with KCNA5, DLG1, DISC1, MYOZ1, GRIN2B, ADAM12, ACTN3, MYPN, PDLIM3, PKN, MYOT, TTN, NMDAR, SYNPO2, LDB3, and FATZ.|$|R
40|$|Alpha <b>actinins</b> (ACTNs) {{are known}} for their ability to {{modulate}} cytoskeletal organization and cell motility by cross-linking actin filaments. We show here that ACTN 4 harbors a functional LXXLL receptor interaction motif, interacts with nuclear receptors in vitro and in mammalian cells, and potently activates transcription mediated by nuclear receptors. Whereas overexpression of ACTN 4 potentiates estrogen receptor α (ERα) -mediated transcription in transient transfection reporter assays, knockdown of ACTN 4 decreases it. In contrast, histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC 7) inhibits estrogen receptor α (ERα) -mediated transcription. Moreover, the ACTN 4 mutant lacking the CaM (calmodulin) -like domain that is required for its interaction with HDAC 7 fails to activate transcription by ERα. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that maximal associations of ACTN 4 and HDAC 7 with the pS 2 promoter are mutually exclusive. Knockdown of ACTN 4 significantly decreases the expression of ERα target genes including pS 2 and PR and also affects cell proliferation of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells with or without hormone, whereas knockdown of HDAC 7 exhibits opposite effects. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type ACTN 4, but not the mutants defective in interacting with ERα or HDAC 7, results in an increase in pS 2 and PR mRNA accumulation in a hormone-dependent manner. In summary, we have identified ACTN 4 as a novel, atypical coactivator that regulates transcription networks to control cell growth...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation of {{oligodendrocyte}} progenitor cells (OPC) to oligodendrocytes {{and subsequent}} axon myelination are {{critical steps in}} vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) development and regeneration. Growing evidence supports the significance of mechanical factors in oligodendrocyte biology. Here, we explore the effect of mechanical strains within physiological range on OPC proliferation and differentiation, and strain-associated changes in chromatin structure, epigenetics, and gene expression. Sustained tensile strain of 10 - 15 % inhibited OPC proliferation and promoted differentiation into oligodendrocytes. This response to strain required specific interactions of OPCs with extracellular matrix ligands. Applied strain induced changes in nuclear shape, chromatin organization, and resulted in enhanced histone deacetylation, consistent with increased oligodendrocyte differentiation. This response was concurrent with increased mRNA levels of the epigenetic modifier histone deacetylase Hdac 11. Inhibition of HDAC proteins eliminated the strain-mediated increase of OPC differentiation, demonstrating a role of HDACs in mechanotransduction of strain to chromatin. RNA sequencing revealed global changes in gene expression associated with strain. Specifically, expression of multiple genes associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation and axon-oligodendrocyte interactions was increased, including cell surface ligands (Ncam, ephrins), cyto- and nucleo-skeleton genes (Fyn, <b>actinins,</b> myosin, nesprin, Sun 1), transcription factors (Sox 10, Zfp 191, Nkx 2. 2), and myelin genes (Cnp, Plp, Mag). These findings show how mechanical strain can be transmitted to the nucleus to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation, and identify the global landscape of signaling pathways involved in mechanotransduction.

40|$|Actin stress fibers are dynamic {{structures}} in the cytoskeleton, which respond to mechanical stimuli and affect cell motility, adhesion and invasion of cancer cells. In nonmuscle cells, stress fibers have been subcategorized to three distinct stress fiber types: dorsal and ventral stress fibers and transverse arcs. These stress fibers are dissimilar in their subcellular localization, connection to substratum {{as well as in}} their dynamics and assembly mechanisms. Still uncharacterized is how they differ in their function and molecular composition. Here, I have studied involvement of nonmuscle alpha-actinin- 1 and - 4 in regulating distinct stress fibers as well as their localization and function in human U 2 OS osteosarcoma cells. Except for the correlation of upregulation of alpha-actinin- 4 in invasive cancer types very little is known about whether these two <b>actinins</b> are redundant or have specific roles. The availability of highly specific alpha-actinin- 1 antibody generated in the lab, revealed localization of alpha-actinin- 1 along all three categories of stress fibers while alphaactinin- 4 was detected at cell edge, distal ends of stress fibers as well as perinuclear regions. Strikingly, by utilizing RNAi-mediated gene silencing of alpha-actinin- 1 resulted in specific loss of dorsal stress fibers and relocalization of alpha-actinin- 4 to remaining transverse arcs and ventral stress fibers. Unexpectedly, aberrant migration was not detected in cells lacking alpha-actinin- 1 even though focal adhesions were significantly smaller and fewer. Whereas, silencing of alpha-actinin- 4 noticeably affected overall cell migration. In summary, as part of my master thesis study I have been able to demonstrate distinct localization and functional patterns for both alpha-actinin- 1 and - 4. I have identified alpha-actinin- 1 to be a selective dorsal stress fiber crosslinking protein as well as to be required for focal adhesion maturation, while alpha-actinin- 4 was demonstrated to be fundamental for cell migration...|$|R
40|$|Actins {{are small}} {{globular}} filaments functioning in cell processes like muscle contraction, and stabilized to the sarcomeric Z- discs by actin binding proteins (<b>actinins).</b> One {{of the important}} gene coding for actin binding proteins in fast twitch fibers is alpha- actinin- 3 (ACTN 3). In this research, we have conducted a gene profile study investigating the genotype and allele distributions of ACTN 3 R 577 X polymorphism in Turkish professional hip- hop and latin dancers and compared them to non-dancers as a control group. 30 professional dancers and non-dancers were recruited for the study. A genotyping procedure {{was carried out by}} a newly introduced four-primer PCR methodology. For statistical analysis, the Chi-square test was used to compare data between the groups (p< 0, 05 evaluated as significant). Numbers and the percentages of dancers were 2 (7 %), 21 (70 %) and 7 (23 %) for RR, RX and XX genotypes, respectively. The same numbers and the percentages were 15 (50 %), 8 (15 %) and 7 (23 %) for RR, RX and XX genotypes, respectively, for the controls. Allele numbers and percentages of the R allele were 38 (63 %) and 25 (42 %) for the control and dancers, respectively. For X allele, the respective number for control and dancers were 22 (37 %) and 35 (58 %). No significant difference was detected between the groups in the terms of genotypes and alleles. Only RX genotype was significantly different between dancers and non-dancers (p< 0, 05). The results of the present and the first study, associating professional dancers and ACTN 3 R 577 X polymorphism, is suggesting that RX genotype may have an genetic advantage for the physical predisposition for dancing, at least in the terms of ACTN 3 R 577 X polymorphism. Prospective studies with extended numbers of dancers focusing on the influence of ACTN 3 R 577 X polymorphism are required for confirmation of these findings...|$|R
40|$|The ubiquitously {{expressed}} {{family of}} α-actinins bridges actin filaments to stabilize adhesions, a process disrupted during growth factor-induced migration of cells. During {{the dissolution of}} the actin cytoskeleton, <b>actinins</b> are phosphorylated on tyrosines, although the consequences of this are unknown. We expressed the two isoforms of human α-actinin in murine fibroblasts that express human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and found that both α-actinin 1 (ACTN 1) and α-actinin 4 (ACTN 4) were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after stimulation with EGF, although ACTN 4 was phosphorylated to the greater extent. This required the activation of Src protein-tyrosine kinase and p 38 -MAPK (and phosphoinositide trisphosphate kinase in part) but not MEK/ERK or Rac 1, as determined by inhibitors. The EGF-induced phosphorylation sites of ACTN 4 were mapped to tyrosine 4, the major site, and tyrosine 31, the minor one. Truncation mutagenesis showed that the C-terminal domains of ACTN 4 (amino acids 300 – 911), which cross-link the actin binding head domains, act as an inhibitory domain for both actin binding and EGF-mediated phosphorylation. These two properties were mutually exclusive; removal of the C terminus enhanced actin binding of ACTN 4 mutants while limiting EGF-induced phosphorylation, and conversely EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ACTN 4 decreased its affinity to actin. Interestingly, a phosphomimetic of tyrosine 265 (which can be found in carcinoma cells and lies near the K 255 E mutation that causes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) demonstrated increased actin binding activity and susceptibility of ACTN 4 to calpain-mediated cleavage; this variant also retarded cell spreading. Remarkably, either treatment of cells with low concentrations of latrunculin A, which has been shown to depolymerize F-actin, or the deletion of the actin binding domain (100 – 252 amino acids) of ACTN 4 Y 265 E restored EGF-induced phosphorylation. An F-actin binding assay in vitro showed that Y 4 E/Y 31 E, a mimetic of diphosphorylated ACTN 4, bound F-actin slightly compared with wild type (WT). Importantly, the EGF-mediated phosphorylation of ACTN 4 at tyrosine 4 and 31 significantly inhibited multinucleation of proliferating NR 6 WT fibroblasts that overexpress ACTN 4. These results suggest that EGF regulates the actin binding activity of ACTN 4 by inducing tyrosyl-directed phosphorylation...|$|R

Biopsied skeletal muscles from three ALS, three MMN and three control subjects had total RNA extracted and subjected to genome-wide gene expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST array. The most significant expression pattern differences were confirmed with RT-PCR in four additional ALS patients. Results showed that over 3000 genes were identified across the groups using q < 10%. Among 50 genes that were overexpressed only in the ALS group were: leucine-rich repeat kinase-2, follistatin, collagen type XIX alpha-1, ceramide kinase-like, sestrin-3 and CXorf64. No genes were significantly overexpressed in MMN alone. Underexpressed genes only in ALS included <b>actinin</b> αα3, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-2 and homeobox C10; whereas only in MMN: hemoglobin A1 and CXorf64. Ankyrin repeat domain-1 was overexpressed in both groups. Underexpressed genes in both groups included myosin light chain kinase-2, enolase-3 and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-1. Validation analysis using RT-PCR confirmed the data for leucine-rich repeat kinase-2, follistatin, collagen type XIX alpha-1, ceramide kinase-like, sestrin-3 and CXorf64. In conclusion, there is differential tissue-specific gene expression in patients with ALS relative to MMN and controls.

In their most prominent roles, <b>actinin</b> and spectrin are responsible for stabilising and maintaining the muscle architecture during contraction, and providing shape and elasticity to the red blood cell in circulation, respectively. To carry out such roles, <b>actinin</b> and spectrin must possess important mechanical and physical properties.

In this study, I assess the contribution of several disease-associated mutations in the actinin- 1 actin binding domain that have recently been linked to a rare platelet disorder, congenital macrothrombocytopenia.

40|$|Actinins are {{cytoskeleton}} {{proteins that}} cross-link actin filaments. Evolution of the <b>actinin</b> family {{resulted in the}} formation of Ca++-insensitive muscle isoforms (actinin- 2 and- 3) and Ca++-sensitive non-muscle isoforms (actinin- 1 and - 4) with regard to their actin-binding function. Despite high sequence similarity, unique properties have been ascribed to actinin- 4 compared with actinin- 1. Actinin- 4 is the predominant isoform reported {{to be associated with the}} cancer phenotype. Actinin- 4, but not actinin- 1, is essential for normal glomerular function in the kidney and and is able to translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription. To understand the molecular basis for such isoform-specific functions I have comprehensively compared these proteins in terms of localisation, migration, alternative splicing, actin-binding properties, heterodimer formation and molecular interactions for the first time. This work characterises a number of commercially available <b>actinin</b> antibodies and in doing so, identifies actinin- 1, - 2 and - 4 isoform-specific antibodies that enabled studies of <b>actinin</b> expression and localisation. This work identifies the <b>actinin</b> rod domain as the predominant domain that influences <b>actinin</b> localisation however localisation is likely to be effected by the entire <b>actinin</b> protein. si-RNA- mediated knockdown of actinin- 1 and - 4 did not affect migration in a number of cell lines highlighting that migration may only require a fraction of total non-muscle <b>actinin</b> levels. This work finds that the Ca++-insensitive variant of actinin- 4 is expressed only in the nervous system and thus cannot be regarded as a smooth muscle isoform, as is the case for the Ca++-insensitive variant of actinin- 1. This work also identifies a previously unreported exon 19 a+ 19 b expressing variant of actinin- 4 in human skeletal muscle. This work finds that alternative splice variants of actinin- 1 and - 4 are co-expressed in a number of tissues, in particular the brain. In contrast to healthy brain, glioblastoma cells express Ca++-sensitive variants of both actinin- 1 and - 4. Actin-binding properties of actinin- 1 and - 4 are similar and are unlikely to explain isoform-specific functions. Surprisingly, this work reveals that actinin- 1 /- 4 heterodimers, rather than homodimers, are the most abundant form of <b>actinin</b> in many cancer cell lines. Taken together this data suggests that actinin- 1 and - 4 cannot be viewed as distinct entities from each other but rather as proteins that can exist in both homodimeric and heterodimeric forms. Finally, this work employs yeast two-hybrid and proteomic approaches to identify actinin-interacting proteins. In doing so, this work identifies a number of putative actinin- 4 specific interacting partners that may help to explain some of the unique functions attributed the actinin- 4. The observation of alternative splice variants of actinin- 1 and - 4 combined with the observed potential of these proteins to form homodimers and heterodimers suggests that homodimers and heterodimers with novel actin-binding properties and interaction networks may exist. The ability to behave in this manner may have functional implications. This may be of importance considering that these proteins are central to such processes as cell migration and adhesion.

40|$|Cross-linking of actin {{filaments}} (F-actin) into bundles {{and networks}} was investigated {{with three different}} isoforms of the dumbbell-shaped alpha-actinin homodimer under identical reaction conditions. These were isolated from chicken gizzard smooth muscle, Acanthamoeba, and Dictyostelium, respectively. Examination in the electron microscope revealed that each isoform was able to cross-link F-actin into networks. In addition, F-actin bundles were obtained with chicken gizzard and Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin, but not Dictyostelium alpha- <b>actinin</b> under conditions where actin by itself polymerized into disperse filaments. This F-actin bundle formation critically depended on the proper molar ratio of alpha-actinin to actin, and hence F-actin bundles immediately disappeared when free alpha-actinin was withdrawn from the surrounding medium. The apparent dissociation constants (Kds) at half-saturation of the actin binding sites were 0. 4 microM at 22 degrees C and 1. 2 microM at 37 degrees C for chicken gizzard, and 2. 7 microM at 22 degrees C for both Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium alpha- <b>actinin.</b> Chicken gizzard and Dictyostelium alpha-actinin predominantly cross-linked actin filaments in an antiparallel fashion, whereas Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin cross-linked actin filaments preferentially in a parallel fashion. The average molecular length of free alpha- <b>actinin</b> was 37 nm for glycerol-sprayed/rotary metal-shadowed and 35 nm for negatively stained chicken gizzard; 46 and 44 nm, respectively, for Acanthamoeba; and 34 and 31 nm, respectively, for Dictyostelium alpha- <b>actinin.</b> In negatively stained preparations we also evaluated the average molecular length of alpha-actinin when bound to actin filaments: 36 nm for chicken gizzard and 35 nm for Acanthamoeba alpha- <b>actinin,</b> a molecular length roughly coinciding with the crossover repeat of the two-stranded F-actin helix (i. e., 36 nm), but only 28 nm for Dictyostelium alpha-actinin. Furthermore, the minimal spacing between cross-linking alpha-actinin molecules along actin filaments was close to 36 nm for both smooth muscle and Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin, but only 31 nm for Dictyostelium alpha-actinin. This observation suggests that the molecular length of the alpha-actinin homodimer may determine its spacing along the actin filament, and hence F-actin bundle formation may require "tight" (i. e., one molecule after the other) and "untwisted" (i. e., the long axis of the molecule being parallel to the actin filament axis) packing of alpha-actinin molecules along the actin filaments...|$|E

Genetically encoded FRET-based force sensors now allow the measurement of local stress in specific host proteins in vivo in real time. For a minimally invasive probe, we designed one with a mechanical compliance matching that of many common cytoskeleton proteins. sstFRET is a cassette composed of Venus and Cerulean linked by a spectrin repeat. The stress sensitivity of the probe was measured in solution using DNA springs to push the donor and acceptor apart with 5 – 7 pN and this produced large changes in FRET. To measure cytoskeletal stress in vivo we inserted sstFRET into α-actinin and expressed it in HEK and BAEC cells. Time-lapse imaging showed the presence of stress gradients in time and space, often uncorrelated with obvious changes in cell shape. The gradients could be rapidly relaxed by thrombin-induced cell contraction associated with inhibition of myosin II. The tension in <b>actinin</b> fluctuated rapidly (scale of seconds) illustrating a cytoskeleton in dynamic equilibrium. Stress in the cytoskeleton can be driven by macroscopic stresses applied to the cell. Using sstFRET as a tool to measure internal stress, we tested the prediction that osmotic pressure increases cytoskeletal stress. As predicted, hypotonic swelling increased the tension in <b>actinin,</b> confirming the model derived from AFM. Anisotonic stress also produced a novel transient (~ 2 minutes) decrease in stress upon exposure to a hypotonic challenge, matched by a transient increase with hypertonic stress.

Analysis of 800 residues of deduced {{amino acid sequence}} at the amino- terminal end revealed a strikingly conserved domain of integral of 230 residues that shows {{a high degree of}} sequence similarity to the amino- terminal domains of alpha <b>actinin</b> and dystrophin. This conserved domain constitutes a new diagnostic criterion for spectrin-related proteins and allows the known properties of one of these proteins to predict functional properties of the others. The conservation of the amino- terminal domain, and other regions in spectrin, alpha <b>actinin,</b> and dystrophin, demonstrates that a common set of domains were linked in different combinations through evolution to generate the distinctive members of the spectrin superfamily...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} {{fluorescent}} analogue cytochemistry, image intensification, and {{digital image processing}} to examine the redistribution of alpha- <b>actinin</b> and vinculin in living cultured African green monkey kidney (BSC- 1) cells treated with the phorbol ester 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA). Before treatment, microinjected alpha-actinin shows characteristic distribution along stress fibers and at adhesion plaques; vinculin is localized predominantly at adhesion plaques. Soon after the addition of TPA, highly dynamic membrane ruffles begin to form. These incorporate {{a large amount of}} alpha-actinin but little vinculin. Alpha-actinin is subsequently depleted, more or less uniformly, from stress fibers. Disrupted stress fibers often fragment into aggregates and move into the perinuclear region. Careful analyses of fluorescence intensity distribution indicate that alpha-actinin is depleted more rapidly from adhesion plaques than from stress fibers. Furthermore, the depletion of alpha-actinin from adhesion plaques is also faster than either the depletion of vinculin or the disappearance of focal contacts. These observations indicate that TPA may initiate disruption of stress fibers by interfering with a link between alpha- <b>actinin</b> and vinculin, causing alpha-actinin to be preferentially depleted from adhesion plaques...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) mimics the cellular binding site of many adhesive proteins in the extracellular matrix and causes rounding and detachment of spread cells. We have studied whether its binding affects the associations {{of two major}} components, alpha- <b>actinin</b> and vinculin, at the adhesion plaque. Living 3 T 3 cells were microinjected with fluorescently labeled alpha-actinin and/or vinculin and observed using video microscopy {{before and after the}} addition of 50 micrograms/ml GRGDS. As soon as 5 min after treatment, fluorescent alpha-actinin and vinculin became dissociated simultaneously from the sites of many focal contacts. The proteins either moved away as discrete structures or dispersed from adhesion plaques. As a result, the enrichment of alpha-actinin and vinculin at these focal contacts was no longer detected. The focal contacts then faded away slowly without showing detectable movement. These data suggest that the binding state of integrin has a transmembrane effect on the distribution of cytoskeletal components. The dissociation of alpha- <b>actinin</b> and vinculin from adhesion plaques may in turn weaken the contacts and result in rounding and detachment of cells...|$|E
