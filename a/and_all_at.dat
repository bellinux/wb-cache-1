25|$|In 1392, Robert III {{strengthened}} {{the position of}} his son David, now Earl of Carrick, when he endowed him with a large annuity that allowed the young prince to build up his household and affinity, and then in 1393 regained his right to direct rule when the general council decided that Fife's lieutenancy should end, and that Carrick, now of age, should assist his father. This independence of action was demonstrated in 1395–6, when he responded to Carrick's unauthorised marriage to Elizabeth Dunbar, daughter of George, Earl of March, by ensuring its annulment. The king appears to have also taken over the conduct of foreign affairs, preserving the peace with Richard II and managing to increase {{the power of the}} Red Douglas Earl of Angus in the southeast of the country as a counterbalance to Fife's Black Douglas ally. He further showed his authority when in an attempt to reduce inter-clan feuding and lawlessness, he arranged and oversaw a gladiatorial limited combat between the clans of Kay and Quhele (Clan Chattan) in Perth on 28 April 1396. David of Carrick progressively acted independently of his father taking control of the Stewart lands in the south-west, while maintaining his links with the Drummonds of his mother, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> a time when Fife's influence in central Scotland remained strong.|$|E
500|$|Carter {{also sought}} to rectify small issues that fans had with the 1998 feature film, The X-Files, explaining, [...] "I think {{if there was any}} trouble with the movie, it was that we promised so much that we didn't deliver all of it. I think we wanted to deliver a lot, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> once, in these two episodes". Episode co-writer Frank Spotnitz agreed, saying that when The X-Files film was being {{promoted}} with the tagline [...] "The Truth is Revealed," [...] he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear. Spotnitz also felt that writing [...] "One Son" [...] was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions. Spotnitz, however, acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show; he called the episode the [...] "biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air".|$|E

500|$|In any case, {{the peace}} {{turned out to}} be of short duration. On 18 May 1803, {{slightly}} {{more than a year after}} the peace, war resumed. Napoleon was now intent on the destruction of Great Britain by culminating in an ambitious planned invasion. The Batavian Republic was to play a major supporting role in this. As the Franco-Batavian alliance's embodiment, the Staatsbewind was forced to assent to a Convention bringing the total of French and Batavian forces in the Netherlands to 35,000. In addition, 9,000 Batavian troops were earmarked for the proposed overseas expedition. Even more importantly, the Dutch were to supply, by December 1803, five ships-of-the-line, five frigates, 100 gun boats, and 250 flat-bottomed transport craft, capable of holding 60–80 men. In total the Dutch were meant to provide transport for 25,000 men and 2,500 horses; the major part of Napoleon's invasion [...] "armada", <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> Dutch expense. It was all a fantasy on Napoleon's part, but this did not diminish the real burden it imposed on the finances of the Republic, and on its economy.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{tall and}} robust figure {{combined}} with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when William Hogarth first saw Johnson standing near {{a window in}} Samuel Richardson's house, [...] "shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner", Hogarth thought Johnson an [...] "ideot, whom his relations had put {{under the care of}} Mr. Richardson". Hogarth was quite surprised when [...] "this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> once took up the argument... such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked at him with astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired". Beyond appearance, Adam Smith claimed that [...] "Johnson knew more books than any man alive", while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament, he [...] "certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there". Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric, and he is well known for his [...] "refutation" [...] of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, [...] "I refute it thus!" ...|$|E

2500|$|AT {{agreed to}} convey fresh meat and produce free-of-charge to any Harvey House via its own private line of {{refrigerator}} cars, the Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch, and in them food was shipped {{from every corner}} of the U.S. The company maintained two dairy facilities (the larger of the two was situated in Las Vegas, New Mexico) to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of fresh milk.

No longer relegated to mere conversation, she appears here as a major character in a Hitchcock picture, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> once—as later, through Psycho, The Birds and Marnie—Hitchcock began to make the mother figure a personal repository of his anger, guilt, resentment, and a sad yearning." [...] At the same time, he blurred mother-love with erotic love and poignantly, in both the film and in its director's life, [...] "both kinds of love were in fact limited to longing and fantasy and unfulfilled expectations." ...|$|E

2500|$|From December 2010 to April 2011, eight bodies, two {{wrapped in}} burlap sacks, were found dumped on Jones Beach Island near Gilgo Beach. The remains were located not to {{far from the}} Ocean Parkway. Four of the bodies that have been {{identified}} were of missing prostitutes. One of the victims was reported missing in 2007. Police suspect a serial killer may be responsible. In an interview with Newsday, Robert Creighton, a former Suffolk County Police commissioner said, [...] "I have no recollection of anything as complex as this or as large as this." [...] Creighton also said the nearest comparison to this case was the Ronald DeFeo murders. He said, [...] "The difference was, that was all in one place <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> one time."

[...] Cherry Tree Farm <b>and</b> <b>All</b> <b>at</b> Sea played in 1881. [...] The same year, William Poel produced his Hamlet. [...] In the early 1880s, Eric Lewis sometimes substituted at the Hall for Corney Grain. [...] Herbert Gardiner wrote A Night in Wales (1885) for the hall with music by Corney Grain. [...] Alfred J. Caldicott wrote a number of pieces for the hall, including A Treasure Trove, A Moss Rose Rent (1883), Old Knockles (1884), In Cupid's Court (1885), The Friar (1886), Tally Ho (1887), Wanted, An Heir and The Boson's Mate (1888), John Smith (1889), The Old Bureau (1891), and An Old Pair (1893).|$|E
2500|$|Finds {{of early}} Christian papyri from Egypt {{represent}} the earliest surviving indisputable physical evidence for Christianity and the Christian Gospel. There {{is a considerable}} degree of overlap in the proposed ranges of dates for these papyri and consequently it cannot be stated categorically that 52 is earlier than other New Testament fragments of apparent 2nd century date; 90, 104 or perhaps 64+67; nor that it is earlier than some early apocryphal texts; P. Egerton. 2, P.Oxy. LX 4009. There are in addition a number of papyrus fragments of Old Testament books in Greek (chiefly Psalms) which have also been dated to the 2nd century, and whose characteristics have been advanced as indicating a Christian, rather than Jewish or pagan, origin. Nevertheless; since all of these papyri have been dated paleographically, and mostly {{with reference to the}} same dated documentary comparators, they may be considered as a manuscript cluster whose estimated dates will vary as a group; amongst which 52 is commonly recognised as having earlier features. Moreover, and small though it is, the text that survives in 52 is sufficient to provide early witness to a number of key historical claims about the Historical Jesus, albeit that it does not include his actual name. [...] But in these verses we find a man tried before the Roman authorities at a specific date (the governorship of Pontius Pilate), at a specific place (the Praetorium in Jerusalem), sentenced to a specific death (crucifixion), <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> the instigation of the Jewish Temple authorities.|$|E
