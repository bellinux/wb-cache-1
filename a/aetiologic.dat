25|$|The myth of Crane {{has been}} studied by M. Renard and G. Dumezil. The first scholar sees in it a sort of {{parallel}} with the theology underlying the rite of the Tigillum Sororium. Crane is a nymph of the sacred wood of Helernus, located at {{the issue of the}} Tiber, whose festival of 1 February corresponded with that of Juno Sospita: Crane might be seen as a minor imago of the goddess. Her habit of deceiving her male pursuers by hiding in crags in the soil reveals her association not only with vegetation but also with rocks, caverns, and underpassages. Her nature looks to be also associated with vegetation and nurture: G. Dumezil has proved that Helernus was a god of vegetation, vegetative lushness and orchards, particularly associated with vetch. As Ovid writes in his Fasti, 1 June was the festival day of Carna, besides being the kalendary festival of the month of Juno and the festival of Juno Moneta. Ovid seems to purposefully conflate and identify Carna with Cardea in the <b>aetiologic</b> myth related above. Consequently, the association of both Janus and the god Helernus with Carna-Crane is highlighted in this myth: it was customary on that day to eat ivetch and lard, which were supposed to strengthen the body. Cardea had also magic powers for protecting doorways (by touching thresholds and posts with wet hawthorn twigs) and newborn children by the aggression of the striges (in the myth the young Proca). M. Renard sees the association of Janus with Crane as reminiscent of widespread rites of lustration and fertility performed through ritual walking under low crags or holes in the soil or natural hollows in trees, which in turn are reflected in the lustrative rite of the Tigillum Sororium.|$|E

40|$|Several {{investigations}} have described adverse effects in fish inhabiting polluted areas, though the causative, or <b>aetiologic</b> compounds {{have not been}} substantiated. Since environmental pollutants exist as complex mixtures, reliable risk estimations are difficult to obtain. Chemical analyses of known toxicants are not sufficient since unknown toxic compounds will not be identified. Diagnostic tools – biomarkers – will provide information on the potential toxicity, but only limited information on the <b>aetiologic</b> compounds. A promising strategy for pinpointing the major toxicants in environmental samples is to fractionate samples in several steps, guided by the toxicity of the isolated fractions. This enables a more precise identification of <b>aetiologic</b> compounds than the analysis of a non-fractionated sample. The present thesis describes the toxicological and chemical characterization of organic pollutants in the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) polluted bay Örserumsviken on Sweden’s Baltic coast. Compounds in organic extracts of abiotic matrices collected in the bay were separated by degree of aromaticity prior to exposing early life-stages of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The fraction containing PCBs and other dicyclic aromatic compounds (DACs) was less potentially toxic than the fraction containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). An estimated 1 - 5 % of the total ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) induction {{could be explained by}} PCBs, and less than 4 % by the most commonly monitored PACs. Though the <b>aetiologic</b> compounds were not identified, {{a significant part of the}} EROD induction was isolated in a PAC-subfraction containing compounds with more than five rings and the major part of teratogenicity was isolated in a fraction containing three- and four-ringed PACs. As markers for the unidentified potent compounds in the DAC- and PAC-fractions, PCBs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in feral fish eggs from the bay. Adult northern pike (Esox lucius) had elevated levels of hepatic DNA adducts, which correlated with PAH concentrations in their eggs. ΣPCB concentration in pike eggs was equal to the injected concentration in the highest dose of the DAC-fraction, which caused a 50 -fold EROD induction in rainbow trout larvae. This demonstrates that the compounds present in the abiotic matrices posed a threat to all life-stages of fish in this area. The findings in this thesis clearly reveal the limits of our knowledge regarding compounds responsible for potential toxicity in field situations. We need to place greater emphasis on the toxicological and chemical implications of our continuous release of PACs and to work for much more restrictive regulations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the risk of pleural plaques according {{to the degree of}} past exposure to asbestos, type of amphibole asbestos, and smoking, as well as to estimate the <b>aetiologic</b> fraction of asbestos as a cause of plaques among urban men. METHODS [...] The occurrence and extent of pleural plaques were recorded at necropsies of 288 urban men aged 33 to 69 years. The pulmonary concentration of asbestos and other mineral fibres was analysed with scanning electron microscopy. The probability of past exposure was estimated from the last occupation. RESULTS [...] Pleural plaques were detected in 58 % of the cases and their frequency increased with age, probability of past occupational exposure to asbestos, pulmonary concentration of asbestos fibres, and smoking. The risk of both moderate and widespread plaques was raised among asbestos exposed cases, and the risk estimates were higher for widespread plaques than for moderate plaques. The age adjusted risk was higher for high concentrations of crocidolite/amosite fibres than for anthophyllite fibres. The <b>aetiologic</b> fraction of pulmonary concentration of asbestos fibres exceeding 0. 1 million fibres/g was 43 % for widespread plaques and 24 % for all plaques. The median pulmonary concentrations of asbestos fibres were about threefold greater among cases with widespread plaques than among those without plaques. No increased risk of pleural plaques was associated with raised total concentrations of non-asbestos fibres. CONCLUSION [...] The occurrence of pleural plaques correlated closely with past exposure to asbestos. The risk was dependent on the intensity of exposure. Due to methodological difficulties in detecting past exposures to chrysotile and such low exposures that may still pose a risk of plaques, the <b>aetiologic</b> fractions calculated in the study probably underestimate the role of asbestos...|$|E

40|$|Neuroepidemiology has {{undoubtedly}} {{played a}} fundamental {{role in the}} study of multiple sclerosis (MS) by providing some <b>aetiologic</b> clues, although a definitive basis for the conclusive resolution of its enigma is still lacking. Epidemiological and genetic studies have indicated that MS is probably caused by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental, none of which is individually sufficient, which appear to act before adolescence - or possibly later - in genetically susceptible individuals. This unifying hypothesis emphasizes, on the one hand, the role of a genetic-racial susceptibility and the importance of environmental factors and, on the other, a possible <b>aetiologic</b> heterogeneity and lack of specificity of the unknown endogenous and exogeneous agents. In this context, several environmental factors may be involved in the aetiopathogenesis of MS in individuals who are susceptible to the effect of exposure to these factors. Situations or events with biological plausibility, such as childhood or adolescent infectious diseases, exposures to geographic and socio-cultural factors, nutritional habits, hypersensitivity, significant head and spinal trauma, and other factors may contribute, at different times, to the putative acquisition of MS, trigger its onset, and modify its subsequent course. However, additional empirical evidence is needed to clarify the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors...|$|E

An estimation was performed in France of the direct medical cost of patients presented with newly diagnosed seizures and followed {{during the first two}} years after diagnosis.

Costs were estimated in a societal perspective in 1998 value. The impact on the costs of different factors like age, <b>aetiologic</b> categorization and severity of seizures (type and number of seizures), and treatment by anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) was analysed.

40|$|This paper reviews {{existing}} psychophysiological {{studies of}} aggression and violent behaviour including research employing autonomic, electrocortical and neuroimaging measures. Robust physiological correlates of persistent aggressive behaviour evident in this literature include low baseline heart rate, enhanced autonomic reactivity to stressful or aversive stimuli, enhanced EEG slow wave activity, reduced P 300 brain potential response and indications from structural and functional neuroimaging studies of dysfunction in frontocortical and limbic brain regions that mediate emotional processing and regulation. The findings are interpreted within a conceptual framework that draws on two integrative models in the literature. The first is a recently developed hierarchical model of impulse control (externalizing) problems, in which various disinhibitory syndromes including aggressive and addictive behaviours of different kinds are seen as arising from common as well as distinctive <b>aetiologic</b> factors. This model represents an approach to organizing these various interrelated phenotypes and investigating their common and distinctive <b>aetiologic</b> substrates. The other is a neurobiological model that posits impairments in affective regulatory circuits in the brain as a key mechanism for impulsive aggressive behaviour. This model provides a perspective for integrating findings from studies employing different measures that have implicated varying brain structures and physiological systems in violent and aggressive behaviour...|$|E
