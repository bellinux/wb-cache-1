25|$|Amtrak's Superliner Economy Bedrooms (now called Superliner Roomettes, {{although}} they are structurally closer to open sections) accommodate two passengers in facing seats that fold out into a lower berth, with an upper berth that folds down from above, a small closet, and no in-room washbasin or toilet, {{on both sides of}} both the upper and lower levels of the car. Effectively, they are open sections with walls, a door, and a built-in <b>access</b> <b>ladder</b> for the upper berth (which doubles as a nightstand for the lower berth passenger). Superliner Deluxe Bedrooms are essentially the same as historic Compartments and Double Bedrooms, with the toilet cubicle doubling as a private shower cubicle. In addition, each Superliner sleeping car has two special lower-level accommodations, each taking up the full width of the car: the Accessible Bedroom, at the restroom/shower end of the car (below the Deluxe Bedrooms), is a fully wheelchair-accessible accommodation for two, with a roll-in cubicle for the toilet and shower; the Family Bedroom, at the Economy Bedroom end of the car, accommodates two adults and up to three small children, without private toilet or shower facilities.|$|E

50|$|The {{measures}} {{carried out}} by the task force include: Upholding an active 24-hour lookout, the removal of <b>access</b> <b>ladders,</b> reporting apprehensive actions to proper authorities, the use of deck lighting, razor wire, netting, fire hoses, electrical fencing, and surveillance and detection equipment, defending the lowest points of access, engaging in evasive maneuvering and speed through pirate attacks, and joining group transits.|$|R
50|$|At {{a closer}} glance, {{the red and}} white tower {{includes}} an array of antennas including parabolic dishes, dipoles and microwave links. The tower has three main service decks for authorised technicians only with <b>access</b> <b>ladders</b> that run vertically along the eastern side. At night the tower is illuminated with three red beacons which span across the mast from top to bottom. On a clear night and viewed from the city you can often see the beacons and some fluorescent lighting coming from a room inside transmission house.|$|R
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted that}} the episode made {{references}} to previous episodes of the series. The ending, featuring Dwight riding a bicycle on the roof, was positively compared to the third season episode [...] "Safety Training". Adams wrote {{that many of the}} scenes [...] "take characters to corners of the office tied to memories of episode's [...] past", such as Oscar's phone call, which takes place in the stairwell where Dwight pumped himself up for his work review in the second season episode [...] "Performance Review", and Pam climbing up the rooftop <b>access</b> <b>ladder,</b> which is reminiscent of Pam and Jim's first [...] "date" [...] in the second season episode [...] "The Client".|$|E

50|$|The Water Tower (1928-29) (Bldg 8149) {{is located}} {{to the west}} of the Foundation Building.

It had roof <b>access</b> <b>ladders</b> on the smooth left side only, one aft of each side door. Like the Classes 1E, 2E and 3E, the Class 4E had bogie-mounted pilots and draft gear and an articulated inter-bogie linkage, therefore no train forces were transmitted to the locomotive body.|$|R

50|$|The bridge {{features}} two 140 metre (459.3 ft) high silver towers, {{situated on}} either side of the roadway at the midpoint of the bridge's span. These two towers are an aesthetic addition by the architects, and are not joined to the main body of the bridge. These towers are hollow, and feature <b>access</b> <b>ladders</b> to a small roof top hatch. Until locked and surrounded by water, these towers were a popular target for urban explorers. It has four spans with two main spans of 173 metres (567.6 ft) and side spans of 72 metres (236.2 ft), giving an overall bridge length of 490 metres (1,607.6 ft). The bridge supports six lanes of automobile traffic. Access is prohibited to cyclists and pedestrians.|$|R

5000|$|Physical {{environment}} {{may be a}} large determinant in one's ability to <b>access</b> <b>ladders</b> of success or even basic sustenance. Professor of urban planning Rob Imrie concluded that most spaces contain surmountable physical barriers that unintentionally create an “apartheid by design,” whereby individuals with disabilities are excluded from areas because of the inaccessible layout of these spaces. This [...] "apartheid" [...] has been seen by some, such as the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council, as especially concerning with regard to public transportation, education and health facilities, and perhaps most relevantly places of employment. Physical barriers are also commonly found in the home, with those in poverty more likely to occupy tighter spaces inaccessible to wheelchairs. Beyond physical accessibility, other potential excluding agents include a lack of Braille, sign language and shortage of audio tape availability {{for those who are}} blind and deaf.|$|R
