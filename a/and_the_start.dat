5|$|English has {{developed}} {{over the course of}} more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England, and was a period in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of the Great Vowel Shift.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the Colossus-class ships' commissioning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of World War I, {{and the most important}} development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, both ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.|$|E

5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E

In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni's.

A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, which happens to be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of the Apachean LVF.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from May through July, during the cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E
