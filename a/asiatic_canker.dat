40|$|Investigating the {{population}} biology of plant pathogens {{in their native}} areas is essential to understand the factors that shape their population structure and favour their spread. Monomorphic pathogens dispatch extremely low genetic diversity in invaded areas, and native areas constitute a major reservoir for future emerging strains. One of these, the gammaproteobacterium Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, causes <b>Asiatic</b> <b>canker</b> and is a considerable threat to citrus worldwide. We studied its population genetic structure by genotyping 555 strains from 12 Vietnam provinces at 14 tandem repeat loci and insertion sequences. Discriminant analysis of principal components identified six clusters. Five of them were composed of endemic strains distributed heterogeneously across sampled provinces. A sixth cluster, VN 6, displayed a much lower diversity and a clonal expansion structure, suggesting recent epidemic spread. No differences in aggressiveness on citrus or resistance to bactericides were detected between VN 6 and other strains. VN 6 likely represents a case of bioinvasion following introduction in a native area likely through contaminated plant propagative material. Highly polymorphic markers are useful for revealing migration patterns of recently introduced populations of a monomorphic bacterial plant pathogen. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|<b>Asiatic</b> <b>canker,</b> {{caused by}} Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, {{is a major}} threat to {{worldwide}} citriculture. Three pathotypes differing in host range and hypersensitive reactions toward citrus species have been defined. Whereas pathotypes Aw and A* have a restricted host range, X. citri pv. citri pathotype A infects a broader range including most commercial citrus species and hybrids and can cause important economic losses in tropical and subtropical areas. Pathotype A strains, especially those assigned to lineage 1, were implicated in the major geographical expansion of X. citri pv. citri during the 20 th century from their native area, Asia (Pruvost et al. 2014). X. citri pv. citri is listed as a quarantine pathogen in the European Union (EU) – Directive 2000 / 29 /EC annex II A 1. Martinique (France) is an outermost region of the EU in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Canker lesions were first observed at Morne Rouge, Martinique in June 2014 on grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), mandarin (C. reticulata), Tahiti lime (C. latifolia), and Valencia and Washington Navel oranges (C. sinensis). Official diagnostics, including bacterial isolations on YPGA or KC semiselective medium (Pruvost et al. 2005), PCR-based identification with 4 / 7 primers (Hartung et al. 1993), and pathogenicity tests, were performed following the EPPO standard PM 7 / 44 (www. eppo. int) and identified isolates as X. citri pv. citri. Three strains isolated in Martinique in 2014 from grapefruit or Tahiti lime were further characterized (LL 074 - 4, LL 077 - 2, and LL 079). Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) targeting six housekeeping genes (atpD, dnaK, efp, gltA, gyrB, and lepA) (Almeida et al. 2010; Bui Thi Ngoc et al. 2010) identified Martinique strains as X. citri pv. citri with 100 % sequence identity to the type strain LMG 9322. Using MLVA- 31 targeting 31 minisatellites, Martinique strains were assigned to lineage 1 composed of pathotype A strains (Pruvost et al. 2014). All strains were inoculated by a detached leaf assay onto Mexican lime SRA 140 (C. aurantifolia), sweet orange Washington Navel SRA 102, and grapefruit Henderson SRA 336 (Bui Thi Ngoc et al. 2010). All inoculated leaves produced typical erumpent, callus-like tissue at wound sites. Xanthomonas-like colonies were reisolated from lesions that had developed. Boiled suspensions were assayed by PCR with 4 / 7 primers and produced the expected amplicon, fulfilling Koch's postulates. No lesions developed on the negative control consisting of sterile 0. 01 M tris buffer pH 7. 2. This is the first report of X. citri pv. citri in Martinique and to our knowledge in the Caribbean region. Surprisingly, all strains collected to date in Martinique grew on YPGA supplemented with 300 mg liter− 1 copper sulfate even when no extensive copper spray programs have been used, suggesting that copper-resistant strains may have been introduced. Disease is contained by tree removal and burning and the situation is presently under apparent control although positive trees were sporadically detected in 2015 in backyards or small orchards at Le Lorrain and Saint Pierre. An extensive surveillance program is currently implemented in Martinique for quarantine pathogens of citrus. (Texte intégral...|$|E
40|$|In February 2010, {{grapefruit}} (Citrus paradisi) and Mexican lime (C. aurantifolia) {{leaves with}} erumpent callus-like lesions {{were collected in}} Senegal in the Sebikotane area between Dakar and Thies. Similar symptoms have been observed by local farmers since 2008, and lesions were morphologically {{similar to those of}} citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. citri (<b>Asiatic</b> <b>canker)</b> and X. citri pv. aurantifolii (South American canker). Lesions were primarily reported from grapefruit (cv. Shambar), which is the most frequent citrus species produced in this area, and Mexican lime, which is also commonly grown. Both species are very susceptible to X. citri pv. citri pathotype A, and Mexican lime is susceptible to X. citri pv. citri pathotype A* and X. citri pv. aurantifolii (4). Fifteen Xanthomonas-like strains were isolated from disease samples using KC semiselective medium (3). PCR with primer pair 4 / 7 (2) revealed that all the Senegalese strains and the X. citri pv. citri strain CFBP 2525 from New Zealand, used as a positive control, generated the expected DNA fragment, whereas no fragment was observed for negative controls (distilled water instead of the template). Insertion sequence ligation-mediated (IS-LM) -PCR analysis (1) of X. citri pv. citri strains from Senegal and reference strains of X. citri pv. citri pathotypes A and A* (1), with MspI and four primer pairs (unlabelled MspI primer and four 5 ?-labelled insertion sequence-specific primers targeting three IS elements), indicated that the strains from Senegal were related to X. citri pv. citri but not to pv. aurantifolii. They were closely related to X. citri pv. citri pathotype A strains, with a broad host range, present in the Indian subcontinent and Mali (C. Vernière, unpublished data). Multilocus sequence analysis of four partial housekeeping gene sequences (atpD, dnaK, efp, and gyrB) confirmed that four Senegalese strains were not related to X. citri pv. aurantifolii and showed a full sequence identity to X. citri pv. citri sequence type ST 3 (2), fully consistent with IS-LM-PCR. Using a detached leaf assay (4), Duncan grapefruit, Pineapple sweet orange, and Mexican lime leaves inoculated with all strains from Senegal developed typical erumpent, callus-like tissue at wound sites 2 weeks after the inoculations. Xanthomonas-like colonies were reisolated and PCR amplification with the primer pair 4 / 7 produced the same 468 -nt DNA fragment. This represents the fourth outbreak of citrus canker reported from Africa within the last 5 years, the other documented reports were from Ethiopia (2007) and Mali and Somalia (2008). High disease prevalence was observed in Senegal with incidence exceeding 90 % in the orchards where lime and grapefruit were infected for 3 years, indicating the suitability of environmental conditions in this region for the development of Asiatic citrus canker. The origin of the inoculum associated with the reported canker outbreak in Senegal is currently unknown and the precise distribution of the pathogen needs to be thoroughly assessed. To our knowledge, this is the first documented report of the presence of Asiatic citrus canker in Senegal and this occurrence increases the threat to citriculture in West Africa.

The results showed that certain genes were up-regulated in induced condition, suggesting a putative role in bacteria-host interaction.

Despite enormous progress in investigations of the molecular mechanisms for bacterial pathogenicity, determination of the detailed LPS structure–activity relationship is limited, as the current knowledge is mainly based on structural determination of one X. citri pv. citri strain. As X. citri pv. citri strains are distinguished into three main pathogenicity groups, we characterized the full structure of the LPS from two pathotypes that differ in their host-range specificity. This revealed an intriguing difference in LPS O-chain structure. We also tested the LPSs and isolated lipid A moieties for their ability to act as microbe-associated molecular patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana. Both LPS/lipid As induced ROS accumulation, but no difference was observed between the two pathotypes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[1] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citriwith French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, considered as endangered area. X. axonopodis pv. citri, recently renamed as Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (XCC) causes the <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker,</b> a plant disease that affects Citrus spp., Poncirus spp. {{and other members of the}} family Rutaceae. XCC causes necrosis of the parenchyma that leads to necrotic lesions and cankers on leaves, twigs, branches and fruit of susceptible plants. Under severe infection, the disease causes defoliation, unsightly blemishes on fruit, premature fruit drop and general tree decline. The disease leads to extensive economic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas where it occurs. The <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker</b> is known to be present in citrus-producing areas worldwide. It has been reported from Asia, South America (Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Brazil), Oceania and the USA (State of Florida). The pathogen is not known to occur in French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique. It is not present in Europe, either. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [2]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). Following a detailed analysis of the material provided in the pest risk assessment made by France in March 2004 on XCC, which is considered by France as potentially harmful for French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, and after additional study of published information on the pathogen and the disease it causes. The Panel concludes that:* X. citri subsp. citri (XCC) and X. axonopodis pv. citri are synonymous to name the causal agent of the <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker.</b> XCC is one group of the “strains of Xanthomonas campestris pathogenic on citrus” listed in the directive 2000 / 29 /EC, which includes also X. fuscans subsp. aurantifolii and X. axonopodis pv. citrumelo. * <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker</b> causes severe damages and high control costs, where it occurs. * Under the French regulation, the probability of entry of XCC into the PRA area on plant propagation material would be low because of the current ban. The probability of entry on citrus fruit would be higher, as fruit may be imported into French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, although under special requirements. * Should the current regulations governing the imports of citrus fruit and plant material be lifted, the probability of entry of XCC into the PRA area[3] on plant propagation material (rootstocks, grafted seedlings, scions, etc) and citrus fruit would be high. * The probability of establishment of the pathogen in the PRA area would be high because (i) susceptible hosts are grown in the PRA area, (ii) the climatic conditions in the PRA area are similar to those in areas of the pathogen’s present distribution, and (iii) control measures are not likely to be undertaken in the family gardens grown with host plants in the PRA area. * The probability of the pathogen spread after establishment would be high for the PRA area. * Should XCC enter and establish in the PRA area, the direct effect of the disease within commercial groves would be high because of yield losses and costly eradication measures. High yield losses would occur in smallholdings and family gardens, where the disease is not readily controllable, with potential negative social impacts. * Uncertainty remains on the potential role of minor susceptible rutaceous hosts in the introduction and spread of XCC. In agreement with the document, the Panel concludes that XCC is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options and can be considered as a harmful organism for the endangered area of French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique. The Panel notices that XCC is already in the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, as “Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to citrus) ...|$|R

In addition to dispersing bacterial cells and helping them to reach healthy plants as the key factor, and promoting release of leaf nutrients to the microbial community, overhead sprinkler irrigation can generate a film of water over the leaf surface including stomata, providing the symptomless epiphytic populations with a bridge to enter the plant resulting in disease symptoms development (Carvalho et al. 2011). Previously, it has also been shown that <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker</b> was more severe when applying overhead irrigation system which also increased the incidence of this disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Pruvost et al. 1999).

To identify the origin and pathways of these emergences, we used two sets of markers, minisatellites and microsatellites, for investigating different evolutionary scales. Minisatellite typing suggested the introduction of two groups of strains in Mali (DAPC[*] 1 and DAPC[*] 2), consistent with microsatellite typing. DAPC[*] 2 was restricted to Bamako district, whereas DAPC[*] 1 strains were found much more invasive. The latter strains formed a major clonal complex based on microsatellite data with the primary and secondary founders detected in commercial citrus nurseries and orchards. This suggests that human activities {{played a major role}} in the spread of DAPC[*] 1 strains via the movement of contaminated propagative material, further supported by the frequent lack of differentiation between populations from geographically distant nurseries and orchards.

40|$|Outbreaks of {{infectious}} diseases require a rapid response from policy makers. The choice of an adequate level of response relies upon available knowledge of the spatial and temporal parameters governing pathogen spread, affecting, amongst others, the predicted severity of the epidemic. Yet, when a new pathogen is introduced into an alien environment, such information is often lacking or of no use, and epidemiological parameters must be estimated from the first observations of the epidemic. This poses a challenge to epidemiologists: how quickly can the parameters of an emerging disease be estimated? How soon can the future progress of the epidemic be reliably predicted? We investigate these issues using a unique, spatially and temporally resolved dataset for the invasion of a plant disease, <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker</b> in urban Miami. We use epidemiological models, Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and advanced spatial statistical methods to analyse rates and extent of spread of the disease.

Inoculation of Xcc in the leaves was carried out by producing injuries with needles. Lesion diameters were measured at 7, 10 and 13 days after inoculation (DAI). The variety Pera IAC was most resistant to the pathogen and had lesions with smaller diameters, while the variety Washington was most susceptible and had the largest lesions, indicating low resistance to Xcc. SEM images were taken from the lesion development, and sections were obtained from the disease lesions in the tested varieties. The most resistant variety, Pera IAC, had smaller stomatal openings and produced greater quantity of foliar exudates, compared with the variety Washington.

There is a large diversity of plant biosecurity threats which could adversely impact on Australia's production and exports.

All strains were genetically related to X. citri pv. citri pathotype A* (i. e. strains with a host range restricted to Mexican lime and related species) but not to pathotype A (i. e. strains with a wide host range among rutaceous species). The findings were based on discriminant analysis of the principal components of MLVA- 31 data and were further confirmed by pathogenicity data. Two genetically, geographically and pathologically separate groups of strains in Iran were identified. One of the groups had never been previously reported anywhere in the world.

40|$|Of all the {{agricultural}} pests and diseases that threaten citrus crops, citrus canker {{is one of}} the most devastating. The disease, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, occurs in large areas of the world's citrus growing countries including India. At least 3 distinct forms or types of citrus canker are recognized. Among these, <b>Asiatic</b> form (<b>Canker</b> A) is the most destructive and affects most of the major citrus cultivars. Severe infection of the disease produces a variety of effects including defoliation, dieback, severely blemished fruit, reduced fruit quality and premature fruit drop. Warm, humid, cloudy climate, along with heavy rainfall and strong wind promotes the disease. Control of canker in countries or regions where the disease is not present include quarantine or regulatory programme to prohibit introduction of infected citrus plant material and fruit, as well as continuous and strict surveying in the field and the immediate destruction of infected trees. In countries where canker is present, integrated systems of compatible cultural practices and phytosanitary measures consisting of resistant hosts, removal of inoculum sources, properly designed windbreak systems, timely application of protective copper-containing and/or antibiotic sprays are generally the most effective means of disease management.

40|$|Three {{pathogenic}} variants (i. e. pathotypes) {{have been}} described within Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, the causal agent of <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker.</b> Pathotype A strains naturally infect {{a wide range of}} Citrus species and members of some related genera. In contrast, pathotypes A* and Aw have narrow host ranges within the genus Citrus and have been isolated from Mexican lime (Citrus aurantifolia L.) and from Mexican lime and alemow (Citrus macrophylla L.), respectively. We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on four partial housekeeping gene sequences (atpD, dnaK, efp and gyrB) for the genotypic classification of Xanthomonas citri pv. citri and the poorly characterized citrus pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. bilvae. A Mantel test showed that genetic distances derived from AFLP and MLSA were highly correlated. X. campestris pv. bilvae showed a close relatedness to the type strain of X. citri, indicating that this pathovar should be reclassified as X. citri pv. bilvae. All pathotype A* and Aw strains were most closely related to X. citri pv. citri strains with a wide host range (pathotype A), confirming previous DNA¿DNA hybridization data. Pathotype Aw should be considered a junior synonym of pathotype A* on the basis of pathogenicity tests, AFLP, MLSA and PCR using pathovar-specific primers. Evolutionary genome divergences computed from AFLP data suggested that pathotype A* (including Aw strains) is a group of strains that shows a wider genetic diversity than pathotype A.

40|$|<b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker</b> {{is a major}} disease worldwide, and its causal agent, Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, {{is listed}} as a {{quarantine}} organism in many countries. Analysis of the molecular epidemiology of this bacterium is hindered {{by a lack of}} molecular typing techniques suitable for surveillance and outbreak investigation. We report a comparative evaluation of three typing techniques, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, insertion sequence ligation-mediated PCR (IS-LM-PCR) typing, and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), with 234 strains originating from Asia, the likely center of origin of the pathogen, and reference strains of pathotypes A, A*, and Aw, which differ in host range. The typing techniques were congruent in describing the diversity of this strain collection, suggesting that the evolution pattern of the bacterium may be clonal. Based on a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance, the AFLP method best described the genetic variation found among pathotypes whereas MLVA best described the variation found among individual strains from the same countries or groups of neighboring countries. IS-LM-PCR data suggested that the transposition of insertion sequences in the genome of X. citri pv. citri occurs rarely enough not to disturb the phylogenetic signal. This technique may be useful for the global surveillance of non-epidemiologically related strains. Although pathological characteristics of strains could be most often predicted from genotyping data, we report the occurrence in the Indian peninsula of strains genetically related to pathotype A* strains but with a host range similar to that of pathotype A, which makes the classification of this bacterium even more complicated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker,</b> {{caused by}} Xanthomonas smithii ssp. citri, {{formerly}} X. axonopodis pv. citri, {{is one of}} the most serious phytosanitary problems in Brazilian citrus crops. Experiments were conducted under controlled conditions to assess the influence of temperature and leaf wetness duration on infection and subsequent symptom development of citrus canker in sweet orange cvs Hamlin, Natal, Pera and Valencia. The quantified variables were incubation period, disease incidence, disease severity, mean lesion density and mean lesion size at temperatures of 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 42 degrees C, and leaf wetness durations of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. Symptoms did not develop at 42 degrees C. A generalized beta function showed a good fit to the temperature data, severity being highest in the range 30 - 35 degrees C. The relationship between citrus canker severity and leaf wetness duration was explained by a monomolecular model, with the greatest severity occurring at 24 h of leaf wetness, with 4 h of wetness being the minimum duration sufficient to cause 100 % incidence at optimal temperatures of 25 - 35 degrees C. Mean lesion density behaved similarly to disease severity in relation to temperature variation and leaf wetness duration. A combined monomolecular-beta generalized model fitted disease severity, mean lesion density or lesion size as a function of both temperature and duration of leaf wetness. The estimated minimum and maximum temperatures for the occurrence of disease were 12 degrees C and 40 degrees C, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMultiLocus Variable {{number of}} tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) has been {{extensively}} used to examine epidemiological and evolutionary issues on monomorphic human pathogenic bacteria. MLVA is gaining popularity on agriculturally important bacterial plant pathogens {{as a tool to}} improve our understanding of their epidemiology. Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, the causal agent of <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker,</b> is a quarantine organism in several countries and a major threat for the citrus industry worldwide. We screened the genomes of X. citri pv. citri strain IAPAR 306 and of phylogenetically related strains for tandem repeats. Two MLVA schemes targeting minisatellites and microsatellites, respectively, were developed to assess the diversity of this monomorphic bacterium at various spatio-temporal scales. Microsatellites are useful for outbreak investigation. In contrast, minisatellites were used to decipher the global diversity of X. citri pv. citri and revealed four pathotype-specific lineages based on Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC). A single lineage (DAPC 1) comprised strains that were implicated in the major geographical expansion of X. citri pv. citri during the 20 th century. When applied to the analysis of the emergence of in Africa, minisatellites revealed the presence of two different genetic lineages in addition to DAPC 1 on this continent, consistent with SNP data derived from draft genome sequences. Using bacterial populations collected in two neighboring Western African countries, Mali and Burkina Faso, we applied these two genotyping schemes to investigate the origin and pathways of these emergences. Minisatellite and SNP data suggested the introduction of two groups of strains in Mali (DAPC 1 and DAPC 2). DAPC 2 was restricted to Bamako district, whereas DAPC 1 strains were found much more invasive. The latter strains formed a major clonal complex based on microsatellite data. This suggests that human activities {{played a major role in}} the spread of DAPC 1 strains via the movement of contaminated propagative material, further supported by the low differentiation between populations from geographically distant nurseries and orchards and the fact that many nursery strains were assigned to the primary or secondary founder haplotypes identified in the minimum spanning tree. Approximate Bayesian Computation analyses supported the hypothesis that strains from Burkina Faso resulted from a bridgehead invasion from Mali. The new minisatellite scheme represents an opportunity for international X. citri pv. citri genotyping and data sharing. The data generated in this study was deposited in the Xanthomonas citri genotyping database ([URL] (Texte intégral...|$|R
40|$|Xanthomonas citri pv. citri causes <b>Asiatic</b> citrus <b>canker</b> (ACC), which induces erumpent, callus-like lesions on all aerial organs, and {{consequently}} defoliation, premature fruit drop, and twig dieback under high inoculum pressure. Present in most tropical and subtropical citrus producing regions, the disease {{can lead to}} important decreases in yield and limitations to export markets due to the quarantine status of the pathogen in some countries (Graham et al. 2004). Strains assigned to genetic lineage 1 within pathotype A, which has the widest host range comprising most citrus cultivars and citrus relatives, were shown to be primarily involved in the worldwide expansion of the bacterium over the 20 th century (Pruvost et al. 2014). ACC has been considered endemic in Réunion Island since the 1970 s, but was likely present earlier and was not subjected to any eradication attempt. Most citrus growers on the island frequently apply copper-based pesticides as part of integrated pest management programs. A recurring lack of ACC control in several citrus groves was investigated in 2014 using our lab collection of authenticated X. citri pv. citri strains. A total of 501 strains from active epidemics as well as 123 historical strains isolated from 1978 onward were tested for copper resistance using PCR assays targeting copL (Behlau et al. 2013). A total of 115 strains produced the expected amplicon whereas others (including all historical strains) and the negative control (H 2 O) did not. Phenotypic tests were carried out on low-complexing mineral salts casitone-yeast extract-glycerol-agar (CYE) plates (Zevenhuizen et al. 1979) flooded with bacterial suspensions (≈ 5 × 10 6 cfu ml – 1) in sterile tris buffer (pH 7. 2), allowed to dry for 15 min., inoculated with a sterile CuSO 4, 5 H 2 O solution (10 mg ml – 1) with an easySpiral plater {{used to create a}} gradient of log-increasing copper concentrations toward the plate center and incubated for 2 days at 28 °C. Using this assay, copL + strains grew over a radius (measured from the plate periphery where the concentration of copper are lowest) > 23 mm whereas copL – strains growth radius were constantly lower. Copper-resistant strains (CRS) had minimum inhibitory concentrations for copper sulfate ranging from 128 to 256 μ l ml – 1 (Pruvost et al. 1998). A subset of 20 CRS and 40 copper-susceptible strains (CSS) (including historical strains) were all assigned to genetic lineage 1 by minisatellite typing (performed as reported by Pruvost et al. 2014) and split into two multilocus haplotypes shared also with CSS. CRS were widespread in most citrus production areas of the island where they coexisted with CSS. The oldest CRS dated from 2010. Because no extreme hurricane hit the island between 2010 and 2014, the fast spread of CRS over the island was very likely related to their presence in a major citrus nursery, as confirmed by our data. In Réunion, the European Conformitas Agraria Communitatis (CAC) standards (directive 92 / 34 /EEC) certify the disease-free status of citrus nursery plants (assessed by visual inspections for ACC). CAC is presently recommended but not compulsory. This report suggests that a strict implementation of this procedure would have helped limiting the spread of CRS in Réunion. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
