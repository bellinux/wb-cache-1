5|$|Concorde's {{technical}} {{leap forward}} boosted the public's understanding of conflicts between {{technology and the}} environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts. In France, the use of acoustic fencing alongside TGV tracks {{might not have been}} achieved without the 1970s controversy over <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise.</b> In the UK, the CPRE has issued tranquillity maps since 1990.|$|E
5|$|As {{chairman}} of the Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee, Ford secured funds to improve the airports in Louisville, northern Kentucky, and Glasgow. The Wendell H. Ford Airport in Hazard, Kentucky is named for him. A 1990 bill aimed at reducing <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise,</b> improving airline safety measures, and requiring airlines to better inform consumers about their performance was dubbed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise,</b> residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise</b> followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E
5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise</b> is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E
40|$|Noise {{pollution}} {{caused by}} the presence of airfields adjacent to residential areas is studied. Noise effects on the sleep of residents near airports and the degree of the residents noise tolerance are evaluated. What <b>aircraft</b> <b>noises</b> are annoying and to what extent the annoyance varies with sound level are discussed...|$|R
40|$|There {{is concern}} that {{advanced}} turboprop engines currently being developed may produce excessive <b>aircraft</b> cabin <b>noise</b> level. This concern has stimulated {{renewed interest in}} developing <b>aircraft</b> interior <b>noise</b> reduction methods that do not significnatly increase take off weight. An existing analytical model for <b>noise</b> transmission into <b>aircraft</b> cabins was utilized to investigate the behavior of an improved propeller source model for use in <b>aircraft</b> interior <b>noise</b> studies. The new source model, a virtually rotating dipole, is shown to adequately match measured fuselage sound pressure distributions, including the correct phase relationships, for published data. The virtually rotating dipole is used to study the sensitivity of synchrophasing effectiveness to the fuselage sound pressure trace velocity distribution. Results of calculations are presented which reveal the importance of correctly modeling the surface pressure phase relations in synchrophasing and other <b>aircraft</b> interior <b>noise</b> studies...|$|R
50|$|None {{of these}} orders would be filled, however, as the Jetcruzer 500 {{remained}} uncertified and its development slowly stagnated. Specific {{problems with the}} <b>aircraft's</b> <b>noise,</b> high stall speed, and center of gravity were not overcome before all work on it was suspended in 2002. Nearly 20 years of work had still not resulted in a marketable aircraft.|$|R

40|$|The {{point of}} {{subjective}} equality {{in regard to}} perceived noisiness for each of 14 pairs of <b>aircraft</b> <b>noises</b> was obtained using both magnitude estimation technique and the method of paired comparisons. Both methods gave approximately the same estimates of the points of subjective equality for the noise pairs, and both showed similar correspondence to predictive physical measures. Nevertheless, the two methods appear to have greater face validity to the listeners. However, the magnitude estimation technique {{appears to be more}} efficient; for a given level of reliability it requires approximately 50 % of the testing time required by the paired comparison method. The functions relating physical intensity to the estimated magnitude of subjective noisiness had slopes ranging from about. 61 to. 29 for the <b>aircraft</b> <b>noises</b> employed in this study, indicating a required change of about 5 to 10 db for a doubling in subjective magnitude. Some physical units of noise measurement were found to be very predictive (standard errors of estimate as low as 1. 9 db) of the subjective judgements of noisiness...|$|R
25|$|SFO {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{airports}} to implement a Fly Quiet Program, which grades airlines on their performance on noise abatement procedures while flying in and out of SFO. The Jon C. Long Fly Quiet Program was started by the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Noise</b> Abatement Office to encourage airlines to operate as quietly as possible at SFO.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{gradient}} {{can have}} a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as foghorns, thunder, sonic booms, gunshots or other phenomena like mistpouffers. It is also important in studying noise pollution, for example from roadway noise and <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise,</b> and {{must be considered in}} the design of noise barriers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, San Jose International Airport (KSJC/SJC) {{was one of}} the first U.S {{airports}} to participate in the noise regulation program enacted by the U.S. Congress for delineation of airport noise contours and developing a pilot study of residential sound insulation. This program showed that residences near the airport could be retrofitted cost-effectively to reduce indoor <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise</b> substantially.|$|E
2500|$|The second X-48B was {{modified}} into the X-48C starting in 2010 for further flight tests. The X-48C has its vertical stabilizers moved inboard {{on either side}} of the engines, and its fuselage extended aft, both to reduce the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>noise</b> profile; it was to be powered by two JetCat turbines, each producing [...] of thrust. [...] The X-48C was instead modified to use two Advanced Micro Turbo (AMT) turbojet engines in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Due to tourism {{there is}} an {{increase}} in tourist <b>aircraft.</b> The <b>noise</b> pollution from these aircraft disrupts the “natural quiet” of this region, which many wish to preserve.|$|R
50|$|Earplugs {{are also}} {{available}} which help to protect ears from the pain caused by airplane cabin pressure changes. Some products contain a porous ceramic insert which reportedly aids equalization of air pressure between the middle and outer ear thereby preventing pain during landings and take-offs. Some airlines distribute regular foam earplugs {{as part of their}} amenity kits for passengers to aid their comfort during landings and takeoffs as well as to reduce exposure to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>noise</b> during the flight. These can help passengers get to sleep during the flight if desired.|$|R
25|$|From a {{political}} point of view, Grayndler {{is considered a}} safe Labor seat while Lowe is more marginal, having changed hands {{a number of times}} in recent years. Currently it is held by Labor's John Murphy. The previous member Paul Zammit was elected as a Liberal member but quit the party after a change in government policy increased the amount of <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise</b> over the electorate. He unsuccessfully tried to retain the seat as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Proposals {{have been}} made to the NSW Planning Minister by various {{developers}} to approve housing estates that are under the southern flight paths in New South Wales. Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd has been vigorous in advertising its opposition to these plans {{on the basis of a}} general increase in noise levels over a wide corridor which is currently free of <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise,</b> and concern that this will lead to the imposition of a curfew on the hours-of-operation of the airport.|$|E
25|$|Following German reunification in 1990, {{operating}} {{three separate}} airports became increasingly cost prohibitive, leading the Berlin legislature to pursue {{plans for a}} single airport {{that would be more}} efficient and would decrease the amount of <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise</b> from airports within the city. Therefore, it was decided to build Berlin Brandenburg Airport at the current site of Schönefeld Airport, originally scheduled to open in late 2012. For various reasons, mainly issues with the fire alarm/safety system, the opening has been postponed to 2018 or later.|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>aircraft</b> interior <b>noise</b> is critical, especially {{in relation to}} the health, comfort, and psychological wellness of passengers and flight crew on long haul flights. Although, {{it is not possible to}} totally eliminate <b>aircraft</b> interior <b>noise,</b> however, the {{reduction of}} interior cabin noise/vibration can be achieved by careful designing/selecting the structural materials. Considering the increasing usage of composite materials in new airliners, multifunctional composite laminates with enhanced acoustic properties can be regarded as a viable solution to mitigating <b>aircraft</b> interior <b>noise.</b> The paper reports an experimental study on the sound absorption behaviour of composite laminates incorporating synthetic (glass) and natural fibre (flax) reinforcements. The acoustic characteristics of the glass/flax fibre hybrid laminates were analysed using an impedance tube. It was found that the acoustic properties depend not only on the constitutive materials but also the laminate configuration. The results suggest that the concomitant presence of flax and glass fibres promotes synergistic interactions leading to significant enhancements in the through thickness acoustic properties...|$|R

50|$|Members of the Panel on Economic Development {{questioned}} whether <b>aircraft</b> <b>noises</b> would shift northwards due to flight paths. They thought that noise mitigation measures {{should not only}} focus on the originally contemplated areas such as Ma Wan. Compensatory measures should also be offered to neighbouring communities directly affected by the construction and increased flight traffic. Moreover, they requested the government to produce supplementary information regarding its response towards public concern. For instance, they asked the government to propose measures to address concerns raised by green groups, justify the omissions of some concerns and develop an online platform to allow instant public feedback.|$|R
25|$|The BAe 146 {{is powered}} by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 {{turbofan}} engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft's high wing. The ALF 502 {{was derived from the}} Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy transport helicopter. Notably, the ALF 502 had a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most other competing aircraft. This was achieved largely {{through the use of a}} geared turbofan engine; the gearbox allows the fan blade tip speed to stay below the speed of sound dramatically reducing the <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise.</b> Additionally other sound deadening measures include a high bypass ratio compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound damping layers built into the engine.|$|E
25|$|Monterey's noise {{pollution}} has been mapped {{to define the}} principal sources of noise and to ascertain {{the areas of the}} population exposed to significant levels. Principal sources are the Monterey Regional Airport, State Route 1 and major arterial streets such as Munras Avenue, Fremont Street, Del Monte Boulevard, and Camino Aguajito. While most of Monterey is a quiet residential city, a moderate {{number of people in the}} northern part of the city are exposed to <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise</b> at levels in excess of 60dB on the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) scale. The most intense source is State Route 1: all residents exposed to levels greater than 65 CNEL—about 1600 people—live near State Route 1 or one of the principal arterial streets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of time the city of Celle has {{expanded}} towards the actual air base, a development which occurred at other military airfields too. Since the inception of the air base the attitude of the public towards the military and its training facilities has changed significantly. The first complaints about <b>aircraft</b> <b>noise</b> were published in the local newspapers shortly after the German Army Aviation Corps took control of the air base. The complaints reached a climax in 1965 when plans were made public to have a second runway, leading from the northeast to the southwest, built at Celle Air Base and to have a wing of strike fighters stationed at the airfield. Residents, mostly from Wietzenbruch, founded a voluntary association and petitioned the federal parliament. The plans were abandoned and after the Federal Ministry had given assurances that only helicopters would be stationed at Celle Air Base the association dissolved. The noise produced by the helicopters, however, remained a subject of contention in local newspapers.|$|E
