50|$|Since {{a patent}} right {{is also a}} kind of {{property}} right, an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> of a patent right constitutes a tort, and a patentee who sustains damages {{as a result of}} an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> may demand damages from the infringer in tort (Article 709 of the Civil Code). Unlike an ordinary tortious act however, in the case of the infringement of a patent right, it is often difficult to prove the amount of the loss, as well as intent or negligence on the part of the infringer. For that reason, the Patent Act contains a special provision for calculating the amount of loss (Article 102), a provision on the presumption of negligence (Article 103), and a provision permitting the determination of a reasonable amount of loss (Article 105-3).|$|E

40|$|Article 97 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation (EUTMR) sets {{a number}} of grounds to {{determine}} international jurisdiction in cases of alleged infringement of a European Union trade mark (EUTM). Besides the possibility to bring proceedings before the courts of the Member State of domicile/establishment of the defendant/claimant and where the European Union Intellectual Property Office (formerly the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market) has its seat, Article 97 (5) EUTMR also allows for proceedings to be brought “in the courts of the Member State in which the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> has been committed or threatened”. Lacking specific guidance from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), this contribution asks how Article 97 (5) EUTMR is to be interpreted in relation to proceedings for alleged infringement of a EUTM over the internet.

40|$|On a daily basis, {{millions}} of Internet users re-blog, re-tweet, and re-post {{the content of}} others on social media. It is conduct {{that has led to}} a flourishing social Internet culture, but it is also conduct that implicates many clashing interests. For some, an Internet meme is a work of their own creativity whose co-option by the Internet at large is an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement.</b> For others, an Internet meme is a violation of their privacy resulting in severe emotional distress. For still others, an Internet meme is a vital communicative tool expressing particular ideas that cannot be articulated in any other way. This Article argues that the legal analyses applied to memes should strive to seek a balance between all of these interests, promoting the continuation of meme culture while also protecting those harmed by meme culture’s excesses. This Article uses the examples of a number of different memes to demonstrate that meme usage encompasses a spectrum of activity ranging from static to mutating in nature. These different uses have correspondingly different impacts on the legal rights of all three meme interest groups, none of which are adequately captured by traditional applications of existing doctrines of intellectual property or privacy laws. This Article posits that explicit acknowledgment of the wide spectrum of meme behavior should be used to help guide and appropriately adjust the application of legal doctrine to the meme in question, with attention paid to the underlying policy interests of a particular meme use. This can lead to more effective legal decisions regarding these memes that balance more precisely the interests of all those affected—both negatively and positively—by Internet meme culture...|$|E

40|$|Communication {{right is}} a form of {{copyright}} to regulate the communication of works, performances, and phonograms on an interactive on-demand basis by wire or wireless means. China has introduced its 2006 Network Regulations to protect communication right from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) ’s infringement, with regard to ISP’s each functional role as content provider and non-content provider of access provider, host provider, and information location tool provider. This thesis will examine whether the Chinese protection of the communication right concerning ISP’s infringement is adequate to permit effective action against any infringement of the right, according to the WIPO Internet Treaties-standard. The method employed in this dissertation is to analyse the protection of the communication right with respect to five closely interrelated key issues that require elucidation in sequence, which are the framework of the right, the reproduction during the communication, the technical protection, the rules of limitations and exceptions, and the enforcement of the right. During each analysis, the relevant provisions of both the WIPO Internet Treaties and Chinese Copyright Law will be analysed. Afterwards, a comparison between the relevant provisions will be made to examine whether the Chinese protection satisfies the minimum standard of the WIPO Internet Treaties. As the WIPO Internet Treaties do not define the extent of the concrete protection at a national level, a further analysis, which is based upon the study of the Chinese legal practice, will be made to examine whether the Chinese protection is adequate to permit effective action against ISP’s <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> of the right. After the analysis and comparison, this thesis will assert that the protection of the communication right concerning ISP’s infringement under Chinese Copyright Law still remains inadequate, due to the legislative disadvantages within the three-level copyright system. This thesis will identify those disadvantages, with respect to ISP’s different functional roles, and make a concrete proposal for legislative reform.

40|$|The Hatch-Waxman Act {{drastically}} {{altered the}} way pioneer and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers litigate patent infringement disputes, allowing generic manufacturers to submit an abbreviated {{new drug application}} (ANDA) to the FDA, which states that it intends make a chemical equivalent of a patent owner’s drug. When the ANDA {{is accompanied by a}} Paragraph IV certification, representing that the generic intends to market the drug before the patent’s expiration because it believes the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic’s drug, the ANDA submission itself creates an “artificial” <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement.</b> With the Supreme Court’s recent tightening of general personal jurisdiction, many pioneers seeking to litigate these “artificial” infringement claims relied on a theory of specific personal jurisdiction to bring suits against defendants in their chosen forums. Consequently, it is important that courts hearing these cases clearly understand how they must apply the prongs of the specific jurisdiction “minimum contacts” analysis. However, in the decades following the Supreme Court’s decision in Helicopteros, which introduced the so-called “nexus” test – the requirement that courts must determine whether the litigation “arises from or relates to” the defendant’s contacts with a forum – the Supreme Court has provided frustrating little guidance for interpreting this requirement, leaving it up to lower courts to decide their preferred approach. This lack of guidance is particularly problematic in Paragraph IV cases, because the litigation is “artificial,” arising almost out of thin air when the generic submits an ANDA. Thus, a defendant’s contacts with a forum in these cases are, by nature, much more tenuous than a typical defendant’s contacts in a typical infringement suit. This Comment reviews a recent case decided by the Federal Circuit, Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in which the Federal Circuit considered the “nexus” requirement {{within the context of a}} Paragraph IV case, but failed to provide the type of clarity that Paragraph IV cases desperately need. Furthermore, this Comment argues that the public policy considerations behind the Hatch-Waxman Act support a permissive interpretation of the Helicopteros “nexus” requirement in Paragraph IV cases, and urges the Federal Circuit to adopt the “sliding scale” test favored in other circuits for these types of suits in the future...|$|E
40|$|As {{digital rights}} holders become {{increasingly}} proactive in asserting their rights against infringers, Internet service providers ("ISPs") are more frequently becoming embroiled in online copyright infringement disputes.
