Feminist critics believe that it adopts archaic <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>women,</b> such as worshiping them symbolically through stereotypes and sexist norms.

25|$|According to New Testament scholar Dr. Frank Stagg and classicist Evelyn Stagg, the {{synoptic}} Gospels of {{the canonical}} New Testament contain {{a relatively high}} number of references to women. The Staggs find no recorded instance where Jesus disgraces, belittles, reproaches, or stereotypes a woman. These writers claim that examples of the manner of Jesus are instructive for inferring his <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>women</b> and show repeatedly how he liberated and affirmed women.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the bra took off the way it did {{in large part because of}} World War I, which shook up gender roles by putting many women to work in {{factories}} and uniforms for the first time. The war also influenced social <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>women</b> and helped to liberate them from corsets. But women were already moving into the retail and clerical sectors. Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly tucked into the back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918. Advertising was now promoting the shaping of the bust to contemporary fashion demands, and sales reflected this.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{would argue}} that {{negative}} <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> exist only when these women threaten optimal reproduction. Yet, other research demonstrates that social norm violations create negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> even when reproduction is not threatened. Therefore, {{the goal of the}} current research was to examine whether social norms influence <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> from an evolutionary psychology account by presenting participants with one of four vignettes describing a target woman with optimal reproductive fitness using a 2 (Participant Gender: Women, Men) x 2 (Pregnancy Status of the Target: Pregnant, Not- Pregnant), x 2 (Target Injunctive Norm Adherence: Adheres, Violates) fully between subjects design. Results demonstrated that norm adherence influences <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> and that participant gender (all heterosexual) moderates the norm adherence influence. These results show that social information necessarily interacts with the affordance management system to generate varied <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> not threatening optimal reproduction...|$|R

In 1992, Frederick Busch wrote in The New York Times that Hemingway had gone out of fashion.

Bergler argues that while homosexual men attribute their sexual promiscuity to their desire for variety and their [...] "insatiable sexual appetites", its actual causes are the inherently unsatisfying nature of male homosexual sex and homosexual men's [...] "constant masochistic craving for danger". Bergler writes that homosexual men typically suffer from a tendency toward megalomania.|$|E
2500|$|Barnes's chapbook [...] (1915) {{collects}} eight [...] "rhythms" [...] {{and five}} drawings. The poems show the strong influence of late 19th century Decadence, and {{the style of}} the illustrations resembles Aubrey Beardsley's. The setting is New York City, and the subjects are all women: a cabaret singer, a woman seen through an open window from the elevated train, and, in the last poem, the corpses of two suicides in the morgue. The book describes women's bodies and sexuality in terms that have indeed struck many readers as repulsive, but, as with much of Barnes's work, the author's stance is ambiguous. Some critics read the poems as exposing and satirizing cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{continues to}} be a problem within society, with many studies focusing on general <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> violence against <b>women</b> as a gauge of positive societal change in this area. To investigate whether individual personal <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> violence against <b>women</b> were predictive of prosocial bystander behaviours in situations of IPV, 157 Australian community members completed an online survey. This survey investigated the factors of bystander intention, bystander self-efficacy, general and privacy <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> violence against <b>women,</b> fear of intervening and the effects/impact of psychological abuse as predictors of willingness to intervene in IPV situations. Bystander intention, self-efficacy and gender were significantly associated with willingness to intervene, whilst respondent’s <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> violence against <b>women</b> was not.

40|$|Stigmatic and sex-biased <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> {{contemporary}} alcoholic <b>women</b> can {{be traced}} back to the 1800 s.

Alcoholism was once considered a problem for men, but an estimated 3. 9 million, or about one third of all alcohol-abusing or alcohol-dependent persons, are women (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA], 1995).
