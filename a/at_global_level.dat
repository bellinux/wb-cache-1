5|$|Tonelli took up {{swimming}} {{due to his}} asthma, {{and quickly}} came to prominence. Selected to represent Australia at the 1973 World Championships, he came sixth in the 200m backstroke {{at the age of}} 16. He won his first Australian titles in 1974 in the 100m backstroke and 200m butterfly and went on to the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, where he won his first major international race, the 100m backstroke, and took silver in the 200m backstroke. In 1975, Tonelli won his only individual medal <b>at</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> a silver in the 200m backstroke at the World Championships in Cali, Colombia. In 1975, Tonelli enrolled at the University of Alabama in the United States, studying and competing in the collegiate sport system. He was selected in both backstroke events for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, but struggled and missed the medals in both events. During his stay in America, Tonelli set times that would have placed him among the world's leading swimmers, but he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaches of discipline.|$|E

500|$|In 1944, he was {{appointed}} director of the Institute when Kellaway {{was appointed}} director of the Wellcome Foundation. Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was {{of the opinion that}} the institute could not make a significant impact <b>at</b> <b>global</b> <b>level</b> in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he [...] "displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work".|$|E

The policymakers might institutionalize the citizens’ involvement, and make their participation an additional element in the process of authoritative policymaking <b>at</b> the <b>global</b> <b>level.</b> The third option is to go even further and replace the inter-State policymaking with a kind of global democracy: a system of representative democracy <b>at</b> the <b>global</b> <b>level.</b> All three scenarios will be explored, with a focus on the second...|$|R
