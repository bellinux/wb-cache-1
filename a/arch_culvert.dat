50|$|The {{project was}} {{labour-intensive}} took {{five years to}} complete. Working conditions were hard and isolated. Initially, all workers were located in one large camp near {{the base of the}} range, No. 1 Camp, where a pipeworks was erected on Ollera Creek. There were four major campsites throughout the duration of the project, {{but it is difficult to}} determine the total number of camps accurately because, as work progressed, smaller satellite campsites were established near where significant work, such as the construction of concrete <b>arch</b> <b>culverts,</b> was being undertaken. Mango and lemon trees and passionfruit vines previously marked the locations of these campsites, but these have mostly been removed, so that it is now difficult to determine where the campsites were situated on the ground. The campsite at The Saddle, some 10.1 km from the start of the road, was quite large, housing over 100 workers and being maintained over a period of three years. The camp was on level ground below the road on the right-hand side, and included the Main Roads Commission site office, a tool shed and a telephone. Three large ship's water tanks now mark the location of this campsite. These tanks stored water for the camp, being fed by a nearby creek. Water was transported to fill the tanks in dry weather.|$|R
40|$|Ireland is {{currently}} undergoing the largest extension to the National road network in recent years. For this reason, {{the number of}} crossing structures for wildlife on the Irish National road network has increased markedly within the last few years. In Ireland, the structures are targeted at protected species whose habitat is directly disturbed by road construction. In general, the target species are otters (Lutra lutra) and badgers (Meles meles). However, structures {{have been put in}} place for red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris); i. e., rope ladders linking trees on opposite sides of a motorway and the first structures for pine martens (Martes martes) and bats will be put in place in the coming year. Bat boxes and bird boxes have also been fitted on the tunnel ceilings of oversized <b>arched</b> <b>culverts</b> with mammal ledges. Underpasses and overpasses (potential green bridges) have been constructed where farms have been bisected by new road schemes. These structures allow for the safe passage of domestic cattle over the road carriageway, but may also be utilized by wildlife, for example, red deer (Cervus elaphus) and other smaller wildlife species. Non-target native species which can utilise these structures are: red deer (Cervus elaphus), the indigenous Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus), stoat (Mustela erminea hibernica), fox (Vulpes vulpes), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and field or wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Non-native species which could potentially utilize such structures include: Sika deer (Cervus nippon), fallow deer (Cervus dama), brown hare (Lepus europaeus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), house mouse (Mus (musculus) domesticus), bank vole (Clethrionomys Glareolus), feral ferret (Mustela furo), American mink (Mustela vison), and domestic cats and dogs, amongst other introduced species. This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of crossing structures in Ireland. An initial pilot study monitoring the use of crossing structures on the Watergrasshill By-Pass, County Cork, Ireland, revealed encouraging results as the following species were found to utilize oversized <b>arched</b> <b>culverts</b> with mammal ledges: otter, fox, rabbit, pygmy shrew and wood mouse. Tracking tools utilized include: ink pads, sand beds, and infrared cameras. The initial pilot study was expanded to monitor crossing structures on a national scale in order to examine: (A) how effective are the culverts at providing passage for the target species? and (B) to what extent are cow under- and overpasses being utilised by wildlife? More specifically, the study is also currently examining: (1) with what frequency are the various passages being utilized?; (2) what non-target species utilize these passages?; (3) does the design of the fauna pipe (dimensions) affect utilization of the passage? e. g., are shorter pipes or longer pipes or small diameter (600 mm) or large diameter pipes (900 mm) more frequently used?; (4) does the presence of hedgerow planting enhance use of passage structures? (5) what kind of pipes do smaller species have a preference for? It is intended that {{the results of the study}} will provide valuable information which could improve the layout, design, and maintenance of future crossing structures to be put in place on national road schemes in Ireland, and indeed, in other countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of fish passage [...] especially fish ladders [...] for diadromous fish is not new in Maine. At Damariscotta Mills, an original fishway constructed in 1807 has been rebuilt many times, and is currently undergoing another renovation. Other fishways of even more recent construction have fallen into deterioration, or have become ineffective due to the partial or complete failure of dams. The landscape of failed and failing fishways offers important lessons to modern day practioners of fish passage design, including {{the need to maintain}} dams and fishways and the need for more sustainable passage design. The NOAA Restoration Center approaches the issue of fish passage sustainability in various ways, including feasibility studies to assess if dam removal is a better option for fish passage, operations and maintenance plans as a requirement of publicly-funded projects, dam inspections and dam repairs by owners as a condition of fishway installation, and more sustainable, low maintenance fish passage designs. Examples of low maintenance designs currently being considered include aluminum baffles (rather than wood baffles) in Denil fish ladders, aluminum stop logs, rock ramp fishways, dam removals, and the replacement of undersized, perched culverts with open bottom <b>arch</b> <b>culverts.</b> Sustainability also requires a realistic assessment of fish passage effectiveness, and the need to diversify fisheries restoration across many watersheds of varying size and habitat quality as a buffer against the failure of individual fishways and the presence of natural barriers. The restoration of diadromous fish in watersheds without dams, especially hydropower dams, should be encouraged as an additional tool for sustainability...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish Transport Administration in Norr- and Västerbotten has {{observed}} many problems with bottomless arch culverts with a span less {{or equal to}} two meters. Up until now the focus has been the environmental improvements, mainly to enhance fish migration, and less respect has been given the technical requirements for the construction. To learn about the damages on the structures and the building process, several bottomless arch culverts has been studied. Information has been collected from articles and reports to study how water streams affects the construction and how to prevent damages. The Swedish Transport administrations set of regulations for how to build in water has been studied, and adapted to the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert.</b> The most severe problems for the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> is deficient foundation, poor or non-existing riprap protection and maybe the most important; {{the absence of an}} actual design process when the span is less than two meters.

40|$|Traditional culvert designs, in many cases, {{have become}} habitat {{barriers}} to aquatic animal species. In response, environmentally sensitive culvert designs {{have been developed}} to function as ecological bridges. Bottomless and buried invert culverts are examples of such designs and are commonly used for fish passage. Additional design guidance specific to streambed stability in buried-invert or bottomless culverts under high flow events is needed. This study investigated incipient motion conditions for four substrate materials in a 2 -ft (0. 61 -m) diameter circular bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> and in a 1 -ft (0. 30 -m) wide rectangular flume in a laboratory setting. General scour of the streambed within the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> was also investigated under partially pressurized and non-pressurized flow conditions. This thesis discusses the experimental methods used to determine incipient motion conditions and analyses of incipient motion prediction methods. This thesis also presents the experimental results obtained from both test facilities with the results of other published incipient motion studies on gravel streambeds. Finally, the prediction efficiency of eight stone sizing methods (open channel and culvert application) applied to the experimental results was analyzed, which may be useful for determining stable stone diameters to be used as riprap in simulated streambeds through bottomless culverts...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} {{culverts}} {{conducted at the}} St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota, beginning in 1946, included several series of observations on commercial, corrugated metal culvert pipes, The primary purpose of these large-scale tests was to obtain pipe friction and entrance loss coefficients which would be more accurate and dependable than those currently recommended in culvert design literature. A previous paper in this series gives {{a discussion of the}} comparison with the results of parallel studies on concrete culverts. The present paper is confined to a discussion of the corrugated pipe culvert test program and an analysis {{of the results of the}} studies. Two types of corrugated metal culverts were tested, namely, the circular and the pipe arch types. In each case, threee different nominal diameter pipe sections were tested [...] 18 in., 24 in., and 36 in., respectively [...] , making a total of six corrugated metal culverts in the test program. Each pipe was 193 ft long and laid on a slope of 0. 20 per cent. For the pipe <b>arch</b> <b>culverts,</b> the identifying dimensions refer to the diameters of circular pipes having the same length of periphery. For example, the 36 -in. pipe arch and the 36 -in. circular culvert have equal perimeters although their heights, widths, and areas are unequal. Cross sections of the various pipes, with controlling dimensions, appear in Fig. 1. (Note that the corrugation height in each case is 1 / 2 in. and that all computations have been based on the inside section, that is on the minimum cross-sectional area.) Friction and entrance loss coefficients were established for the culverts under the usual conditions of field operation. With this objective in view, each pipe was tested for the following conditions: (a) Full flow with submerged inlet and outlet. (b) Part-full flow at uniform depth. For each flow condition, several values of head and discharge were used. In addition, five of the culverts were tested with two different entrance conditions; namely, (a) Pipe projecting 2 ft into the headwater pool. (b) Pipe entrance flush with headwall...|$|R
