5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E

On December 10, after five uneventful weather-probing missions, Davis and the unit were assigned an escort mission.

[...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient.

[...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine.

500|$|The book, {{which was}} Rowling's debut novel, was written between {{approximately}} June 1990 and {{some time in}} 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, [...] "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy {{became more and more}} of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." [...] Then Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to an agent and a publisher, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book, and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was [...] "so much better than anything else".|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E

Two matches later, on 20 August, he took 8/169 also against Leicestershire.|$|E
2500|$|From September 5, 1774 to March 1, 1781, the Continental Congress {{functioned as}} the {{provisional}} {{government of the}} United States. Delegates to the First (1774) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> (1775–1781) Continental Congress were chosen largely through the action of committees of correspondence in various colonies rather than through the colonial or later state legislatures. [...] In no formal sense was it a gathering representative of existing colonial governments; it represented the dissatisfied elements of the people, such persons as were sufficiently interested to act, despite the strenuous opposition of the loyalists and the obstruction or disfavor of colonial governors. The process of selecting the delegates for the First and Second Continental Congresses underscores the revolutionary role {{of the people of}} the colonies in establishing a central governing body. Endowed by the people collectively, the Continental Congress alone possessed those attributes of external sovereignty which entitled it to be called a state in the international sense, while the separate states, exercising a limited or internal sovereignty, may rightly be considered a creation of the Continental Congress, which preceded them and brought them into being.|$|E
2500|$|British {{intentions}} {{evolved as}} the military situation changed after the Chantilly Conference.

The principal role in the offensive devolved to the British and on 16 June, Haig defined {{the objectives of the}} offensive as the relief of pressure on the French at Verdun and the infliction of losses on the Germans. After a five-day artillery bombardment, the British Fourth Army was to capture [...] of the German first line, from Montauban to Serre and the Third Army was to mount a diversion at Gommecourt. In a second phase, the Fourth Army was to take the German second position, from Pozières to the Ancre <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> position south of the Albert–Bapaume road, ready for an attack on the German third position south of the road towards Flers, when the Reserve Army which included three cavalry divisions, would exploit the success to advance east and then north towards Arras. The French Sixth Army, with one corps on the north bank from Maricourt to the Somme and two corps on the south bank southwards to Foucaucourt, would make a subsidiary attack to guard the right flank of the main attack being made by the British.|$|E

The author states that, except for a limited amount of text, nothing had been received by mid-January and the piece continues by describing the legal proceedings taken by Bellini and the various setbacks which occurred even after Romani arrived in Venice. [...] On 2 April, this provoked a response from Romani himself, presenting his case against Bellini based largely on the composer's inability to decide on a subject, as well as justifying all the work which he did after arriving in Venice, only to find his melodramma [...] "touched up in a thousand ways", {{in order to make it}} acceptable to [...] "the Milords of the Thames [...] await him", a sarcastic reference to planned trip to London.
