One is coarse-grained granite having no or little rock-forming magnetite, while the other is fine-grained <b>aplitic</b> granite occurring in sheet-like form and containing coarse-grained magnetite in miarolitic aggregates of K-feldspar and quartz. The major and trace elements chemistry indicates that the <b>aplitic</b> granite is crystallized from fractionated melts of the coarse-grained granitic magma. It is suggested that the fractionated magma became rich in H 2 O which dissociated into O 2 and H 2 and the hydrogen diffused out to the roof rocks; then the oxygen fugacity was increased to form magnetite. Löllingite was discovered along cracks of the coarse-grained granite at one quarry, reflecting a low sulfur fugacity of the post-magmatic hydrothermal activity of these granites...|$|E

Petrographic facies of the North granitic body vary from quartz diorite in the mar-ginal zone (zone A), to tonalite and granodiorite (zone B), and to granite in the central zone (zone C). A large number of barren and scheelite-bearing <b>aplitic</b> veins are distributed around the Yama-guchi deposit which occurs in the contact aureole of zone C granite. The tungsten content of zone C granite is {{lower than that of}} the granitic rocks in zones A, B and the <b>aplitic</b> veins. It appears that tungsten in the differentiated granitic magma, which was associated with ore mineralization, was transported out of the magma chamber by magmatic fluids. The tungsten content is generally low in the North Miyako granitic rocks but high in granitic rocks of Okinoshima zoned pluton, as well as in Otani granite and Busetsu granite from the South-west Japan. In the case of magnetite-series, however, the behavior of tungsten in the Miyako gran-itic body from the tungsten metallogenic province {{is similar to that of}} the Okinoshima zoned pluton from molybdenum etallogenic province in Southwest Japan.

The Comechingones pegmatitic field (CPF) is located in theeastern flank of the Sierra de Comechingones, Córdoba province. It is composed of granite pegmatites belonging to the Rare-Element class, beryl type, beryl-columbite-phosphate subtype; {{some of them are}} transitional into the Muscovite class. Beryllium, Nb, Ta and U deposits, as well as high-quality industrial mineral deposits, are frequently associated with these pegmatites. In {{the southern part of the}} CPF two different pegmatite types have been described. Type I pegmatites constitute large zoned bodies with up to 1000 m long and 50 m thick, and may constitute rare element deposits, whereas type II pegmatites occur as small, unzoned quartz-rich dykes, without metalliferous mineralizations, spatial and genetically associated with <b>aplitic</b> leucogranites. Preliminary geochemical data from bothpegmatites types and granites are presented and discussed in this contribution. Geochemical evidences, supported by field and petrographic observations, suggest that the two types of pegmatites identified in the study area represent two different, probably diachronic, magmatic stages. Type I pegmatites display a geochemical gradation in a S-N direction, from barren pegmatites in the south to fractionated pegmatites in the northern part of the study area, andare the lithological product of the first magmatic stage.

40|$|The Takmeh-Dash region {{comprises}} a {{wide variety}} of igneous bodies that have been developed from early to late Neogene. The granitic rocks and related <b>aplitic</b> apophyses have been developed along fault-dominated structures which define a well pronounced mineralized zone. According to isotopic and fluid inclusion studies, most of the quartz-pyrite units are solution-related with some traces of Cu, Pb, Zn and Au in an epithermal regime. In addition, well-developed alteration haloes are recorded around the intrusions and they include a variety of silica phases in which the textural patterns are similar to that of Queensland (Australia). This study introduces a new method for the prognosis of gold mineralization potentiality in an <b>aplitic</b> facies on the basis of self-organized silica textures as well as textural variations in vein type deposits. With the aid of sampling and microscopic investigation, necessary databases have been acquired from the mineralized region before a fractal analysis of silica distributions by power law relationships. It is an innovative approach toward prospecting the self-organized textures of which similarities have a legitimate relation with boiling point mineralization in epithermal environments. As a result, the Takmeh-Dash mineralogical patterns appear to include stepwise textural variations with peculiar zonal appearances due to post-magmatic procedures. For prospected sub-regions, the silica fractal dimensions not only indicate to maturity of quartzitic veins but represent an enough geological potential for development of Colloform gold-bearing sequences in a deeper altered formation...|$|E
40|$|Two {{chemically}} and petrographically distinct intrusive bodies (a calc-alkaline trondhjemite and an alkaline quartz-syenite cut by granitic aplites) {{occur in}} the vicinity of Piranga (Minas Gerais State), near the southeastern border of the São Francisco craton, Brazil. They intrude the Rio das Velhas greenstone belt and the Mantiqueira complex, both of Archean age. Both intrusive bodies are variably deformed and mylonitized. Age determinations using the Pb/Pb single-zircon evaporation method yielded Paleoproterozoic ages for the emplacement/crystallization of the trondhjemite (2058 ± lOMa), quartz-syenite (2036 ± 4 Ma), as well as the younger aplites (2012 ± 8 Ma). These ages allow us to interpret the calc-alkaline as well as the alkaline magmatism as manifestations of the Transamazonian event in the southeastern São Francisco craton region. Furthermore, the calc-alkaline trondhjemite is interpreted to have intruded during compressional deformation, while the alkaline quartz-syenite and its <b>aplitic</b> differentiates are post-orogenic, possibly extension-related. In terms of the Rb vs. (Y +Nb) contents, the trondhjemite plots in the field of volcanic arc granites, whereas the syenite and the aplites plot in the field of post-collision granites. The mylonitic overprinting of the syenite and the trondhjemite is also Paleoproterozoic, as deduced from the 2012 ± 8 Ma age of the undeformed younger <b>aplitic</b> dykes which cut the syenite. It is likely that this alkaline magmatism correlates with a Paleoproterozoic post-collisional magmatic event well documented in the Transamazonian mobile belts of the northern São Francisco craton...|$|E

The present study shows improvement over our previous paper. Four hornblende clinopyroxene quartz syenites, a hornblende clinopyroxene mela-syenite and a hornblende two-pyroxene syenite from the Yamato Mountains were determined under 0. 05 - 0. 3 GPa P_ in the temperature range 650 - 900 ℃, and at the oxygen fugacity of the FMQ buffer. The stability limit curves of amphibole from four syenites (Y 556,Y 557,Y 904 and Y 34 A) intersect with their solidi at lower pressure than 0. 3 GPa. In all syenites except for a mela-syenite (Y 405), quartz disappears first, then plagioclase and amphibole in that order with increasing temperature at 0. 1 GPa. K-feldspar, in experiments on sample Y 405,disappears at lower temperature than amphibole. In experiments on Y 405,Y 556 and Y 904,albite contents in the synthesized K-feldspar slightly increase with increasing temperature below the solidus temperature, whereas the chemical compositions of K-feldspar are constant and around Ab_ Or_ above the solidus temperature. The chemical compositions of liquids formed by partial melting of syenites are quartz and corundum normative and show the granite minimum composition at 0. 1 GPa.

(in press). The REE-rich veins and pods consist of the epidote-member allanite, monazite, fluorite, and fluorbritholite. These veins and pods occur in association with texturally distinctive fine-grained aplites composed of oligoclase, alkali feldspars, quartz, and biotite. In this study I collected samples of the Idaho Springs formation metamorphic country rocks, Silver Plume-type granites and pegmatites from the Long’s Peak-St. Vrain batholith, and the aplites associated with and containing examples of the REE-rich mineralization. I prepared more than 30 thin sections of these samples, described them petrologically, determined their mineral chemistry using an electron microprobe, and obtained their Nd isotopic compositions and whole-rock chemistry. I conclude that the REE-rich veins, pods and associated aplites formed around the same Proterozoic time as their Silver Plume-type host rocks and are likely co-genetic as products of a F and REE-rich late-stage magmatic fluid intruding into the granite. However, I also determine that the felsic <b>aplitic</b> matrix found {{in association with the}} REE-rich veins and pods is petrochemically different from the granites and pegmatites of the Long’s Peak-St. Vrain pluton. I propose a model for separation of the F and REE-rich late-stage magmatic fluid into the felsic <b>aplitic</b> matrix and the REE-rich veins and pods by either sequential crystallization (aplite crystallizing first further concentrating the REE’s in the residual fluid) or by liquid immiscibility...|$|E

40|$|Albite-, quartz-, actinolite-, apatite-rich rocks with {{accessory}} titanite form a carapace that caps a small dome-like {{intrusion of}} Roxmere pluton, and {{provide evidence of}} the accumulation and release of magmatic fluids that {{may have contributed to}} regionally extensive Na–Ca alteration in the Proterozoic Cloncurry district, Australia. The Roxmere pluton was emplaced after the peak amphibolite facies metamorphism, and into psammitic metasedimentary rocks that are stratigraphically younger and overlie the calc-silicate-rich Mary Kathleen Group. Na–Ca hydrothermal assemblages closely spatially related to the Roxmere pluton suggest that Na–Ca alteration, in this case, is inconsistent with excepted up-temperature metamorphic fluid circulation models. The carapace rocks comprise two variants, aplite and pegmatite, both of which were affected by alteration and brecciation. <b>Aplitic</b> material predominates and the carapace has a brecciated top, and a distinct textural zonation, from an aplite-rich, pegmatite-poor base, to a relatively aplite-poor/pegmatite-rich top. This zonation is interpreted to represent the progressive accumulation of volatile phases toward the top of the carapace, which culminated in fluid overpressuring and brecciation of the granitoid stock. The convoluted and ptygmatic habit of the <b>aplitic</b> and pegmatitic material within the carapace is similar in nature to the comb quartz unidirectional solidification textures that are developed in the roof zones of some porphyry stocks. These complex textures are interpreted to have formed from a single phase of fluid saturation. The Roxmere pluton, or a deeper equivalent, has a Na-, Mg- and Ca-rich composition and a clinopyroxene-, amphibole-rich mineralogy that is consistent with the formation of the contained albite-, actinolite-, apatite-rich phases. However, the source of the rocks within the carapace is equivocal given that their contact relationships are obscured. The δ¹⁸O composition of minerals within the carapace has the following ranges: albite, 7. 1 – 8. 7 ‰; actinolite, 8. 0 – 8. 5 ‰; and quartz, 8. 9 – 11. 4 ‰. Albite and quartz δ¹⁸O equilibria suggest that these minerals in the pegmatitic and <b>aplitic</b> components formed at temperatures of ~ 510 °C to 540 °C. The calculated δ¹⁸O composition of a fluid in equilibrium with these minerals (~ 6. 0 ‰ to 8. 0 ‰), at temperatures between 450 °C and 550 °C, is consistent with a magmatic origin. These estimated temperatures and δ¹⁸O fluid composition are comparable to estimates for regional Na–Ca alteration. In contrast, δD analysis of actinolite (− 136 to − 150 ‰) within the carapace demonstrates that these fluids have a significantly lower δD signature compared to Na–Ca alteration assemblages associated with regional alteration (− 70 ‰ to − 90 ‰). The low values in the carapace could either be interpreted as being produced from meteoric fluids or from degassed magmatic fluids, although a meteoric fluid model is deemed improbable as meteoric fluids in the district have a documented δD composition of ca. 0. 0 ‰. As a consequence, an open-system degassed magmatic–hydrothermal fluid origin is considered to be the most plausible explanation for the low isotopic signatures, and is also consistent with the complex textural relationships described within the carapace...|$|E

The nepheline syenite and pseudoleucite syenite are cut by foid-bearing microsyenitic dykes, whereas the alkali-feldspar syenite and quartz syenite are cut by <b>aplitic</b> and silicic dykes. The predominantly peralkaline Hamit intrusive rocks possess field, petrographic and geochemical characteristics comparable to A-type granites. All intrusive rocks of this pluton show enrichment in LILE and LREE relative to HFSE. The Th/Yb versus Ta/Yb plot suggests that the intrusive rocks formed from an enriched mantle source region carrying a subduction component inherited from pre-collision subduction events. Either thermal perturbation of the metasomatised lithosphere by delamination of the thermal boundary layer (TBL) or removal of a subducted plate (slab breakoff) are the likely mechanisms for initiation of the post-collisional magmatism of this complex...|$|E
40|$|Kinematic {{data from}} the {{basement}} rocks exposed at Lichen Hills in the upper Rennick Glacier, northern Victoria Land, indicate {{the presence of an}} intra-Wilson Terrane late Ross-orogenic high-strain reverse shear zone. ENE directed ductile shearing and WSW-directed late-stage brittle reverse faults overprint metasedimentary rocks and thick leucogranites of the Granite Harbour Intrusives. The Ross-orogenic age of the structures is attested by the involvement of leucogranites in ductile shearing and cross-cutting relationships between younger <b>aplitic</b> dykes and brittle deformations. This structural pattern strongly supports a relationship between the Lichen Hills Shear zone and the Wilson Thrust in Oates Land, the eastern branch of a late-Ross bivergent high-strain thrust system. Post-Ross structures are represented by reverse off-sets of the – in this area – Triassic to early Jurassic Beacon strata that are probably related to volcanotectonic events during Ferrar intrusion and the Cenozoic development of NW-SE striking dextral faults and N-S striking large-scale normal faults that parallel the Rennick Glacier...|$|E
40|$|The Santa Rita stock {{formed from}} a quartz {{monzonite}} magma that intruded gently dipping sedimentary rocks, probably within 1, 500 {{feet of the}} surface. Early crystalliza-tion at the margin resulted in a solid shell of equigranular- or seriate-textured granodio-rite around a partially crystallized mush. Tectonic adjustments fractured the solid shell, resulting in emplacement of aplites and porphyritic granodiorite dikes in the solid shell. The remainder of the magma crystallized with a porphyritic-aphanitic texture. Volatiles released from the magma during quenching migrated outward through cracks and brecciated zones in the cooler margin, depositing in turn (a) veinlets of pegmatitic and <b>aplitic</b> orthoclase and quartz, barren quartz, and molybdenite-bearing quartz; (b) pyrite-chalcopyrite-molybdenite in thin discontinuous fractures; and (c) pyrite-quartz veins. A central zone within the stock, low in sulfides, contains abundant quartz veinlets, vein and replacement orthoclase, secondary biotite, and igneous plagioclase. Diffuse zones of increasing sulfide content and successively more destructive alteration of feld...|$|E
40|$|The Northern and Eastern Sierras Pampeanas {{in north}} central Argentina, are uplifted {{basement}} blocks that expose Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian metasedimentary rocks. These rocks were deformed during the Early to Mid-Cambrian Pampean orogeny. Emplacement of granitoid plutons and dikes {{occurred during the}} Ordovician Famatinian orogeny (~ 480 - 470 Ma, Wegmann et al., 2008). In the Cordillera Oriental, a granite correlative with the Cerro Durazno pluton (472 - 475 Ma, U-Pb, monacite, Lork and Bahlburg, 1993) was intruded {{by a series of}} younger granitic, <b>aplitic,</b> and pegmatitic dikes (a). The granite also preserves xenoliths of the metasedimentary host rocks (b). All these rocks are affected by a ~ 1000 m wide NW-SE shear zone. As a result, the intrusive rocks exhibit a variety of shear fabrics that range from anastomosing granitic lenses (c, d, e) to highly-strained ultramylonitic bands (UM, c, e, f). Gradual changes from proto- to ultra-mylonites occur at cm-scale (e, f). The relatively less deforme...|$|E
40|$|The {{western end}} of the Galway granite {{batholith}} demonstrates the importance of stoping as a granite emplacement process, which is currently controversial, and also of space generation by uplift of the centre of a ring complex. The granite rings are shown (with a coloured 1 : 25 000 geological map) to be consanguineous, near coeval, and older than the 407 – 410 Ma late molybdenite mineralisation. A newly-recognised Mace–Ards granite, around and injected by the <b>Aplitic</b> Murvey-type granite of the ring core (both lacking hornblende and titanite), has biotite–muscovite–cordierite orbs and sulphide–granite orbs, showing separation of immiscible hydrous and sulphide fluids from the late magma which, with vugs, indicates a low pressure, near-roof site. The outer ring of the Errisbeg Townland granite (ETG, the main batholith granite with K-feldspar phenocrysts), was emplaced by progressive outward stoping of the country rock metagabbro, as shown by mapping, and by chemical fractionation of feldspars, biotites and bulk rocks, to the marginal, dry, fine-grained aphyric, in part garnetiferous, highly fractionated, siliceous Murvey granite. Stoping ceased when, after previously invading dense metagabbro, the outer ring complex reached the low-density Roundstone granite, which is shown {{for the first time}} to be older than the Galway batholith. This arresting of the batholith intrusion shows that stoping was such a significant process that emplacement ceased when stoping became impossible. The inside edge of the ETG grades into the slightly later, intrusive, aphyric Carna granite, which shows inward fractionation to the wet magma of the Mace–Ards granite. The ring complex core was injected by highly fractionated, dry, <b>Aplitic</b> Murvey-type granite, intensely hydrothermally altered by late magmatic water. The radially outward dipping, inclined igneous layering in the ETG shows that the original ETG centre was pushed upwards by the intruded Carna granite and eroded away. The Galway granite and its nearby magmatism matches the low Ba and Sr, high Th and Rb, Scottish Cairngorm Suite and similarly has few appinitic rocks associated with it. Magmatism extended over > 45 Myr from ∼ 425 Ma to 380 Ma. It originated by slab breakoff and consequent rise of the asthenosphere, causing deep crustal melting...|$|E
40|$|The Ennerdale Granophyre {{occurs in}} the Lake District between Buttermere and Wasdale. It is a stock shaped, {{composite}} intrusion which was emplaced {{at the close of}} the Caledonian earth movements. The country rocks of the granophyre are the Borrowdale Volcanic Series and the Skiddaw Slates. The oldest rocks in the Ennerdale Granophyre are a series of dioritic rocks which have been largely metasomatised by the later granophyre magma into a series of granodioritic hybrids. Eighty percent of the outcrop of the Ennerdale Granophyre is occupied by a fine grained granophyre, the Main Granophyre. The youngest rocks associated with the granophyre are a series of fine <b>aplitic</b> microgranites and rhyolitic felsites. Metamorphism by the granophyre has been very slight. The main changes in the Skiddaw Slates are a change in colour and an increase in hardness, but the slates in places in Ennerdale have been soda-metasomatised. Macroscopic changes in the Borrowdale Volcanic Series are negligible, but there have been important mineralogical changes within a narrow aeureole adjacent to the granophyre...|$|E
40|$|NCT is {{characterized}} by central greenstone belts of strongly deformed metavolcanics and metasediments surrounded by variably deformed granitoids. We are investigating these external granitoids that comprise the larger batholiths surrounding the North Caribou Greenstone belt in the NCT {{in an attempt to}} understand the magmatic history and processes involved in batholith formation. Mapping and petrologic work identified two distinct groups of granitoids in the region: voluminous, massive to gneissic tonalite, trondhjemite, granodiorite (TTG) batholiths and massive pegmatitic to <b>aplitic</b> K-feldspar-rich granites, which intrude the margins of the greenstone belt and are also ubiquitous throughout the TTG suites. These rocks cross-cut all rock types and occur mostly as convoluted, brittle-ductile dykes (Figure 1). There are two types of pegmatitic rocks: an undated suite consisting primarily of K-feldspar and quartz with minor oxides, including magnetite, and S-type intrusions, containing muscovite, biotite, garnet, and less K-feldspar. Notably, zircon and titanite are absent from pegmatites. The TTG batholiths have a wider variety of compositions, ranging from tonalite to granite (sensu stricto). Important accessory minerals include titanite, zircon, epidote, an...|$|E
40|$|The Barrington Tops Batholith (BTB) is an Early Permian, granodioritic suite intruding the Tamworth Belt in the Southern New England Fold Belt (SNEFB), {{as shown}} in Fig. 1. It is {{composed}} of three plutons of two comagmatic compositions: the two larger plutons, Omadale Brook and Barrington River, are augitehypersthene granodiorite, while the Gummi Plain pluton, to the north-east is a hornblende-biotite granodiorite (Mason and Kaverlieris 1984; Eggins and Hensen 1987). In addition to the granodiorites, Eggins (1984) notes the presence of several phases of dyke and stock intrusion. Two phases of mafic dykes {{are associated with the}} plutons, one intruding before the plutons, and one after. In addition, <b>aplitic</b> and microgranodioritic dykes of similar mineralogy to the main suite are known. These felsic intrusives are noted on the margins of the intrusions and are seen in both the granodiorites and their surrounding aureole. Finally, Eggins (1984) notes the presence of quartz diorite intrusives in several locations around the BTB. However, poor outcrop means that the relationship between these and the other intrusives has not been discerned...|$|E
