5|$|Liverpool Football Club, an English {{professional}} association football club, is Britain's most successful team in Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions. Since 1964, {{they have won}} eleven European trophies: the UEFA Champions League (formerly known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Cup) five times, the UEFA Europa League (formerly known as the UEFA Cup) three times, and the UEFA Super Cup three times.|$|E
5|$|P. l. europaea, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> lion, was {{probably}} identical with Panthera leo persica or Panthera leo spelea. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over-exploitation. It inhabited the Balkans, the Italian Peninsula, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula. It {{was a very}} popular object of hunting among ancient Romans and Greeks.|$|E

50|$|In June 2010, Ricardo {{started in}} the 0-0 draw that the minnows (ranked 117th) managed against Portugal, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> were {{preparing}} for that year's FIFA World Cup.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{public building}} in the inner-city is the Anglican Church of St John the Baptist, in the suburb of Reid, which was consecrated in 1845. St John's churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> presence increased, the indigenous population dwindled, mainly from disease such as smallpox and measles.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} special paint {{jobs have been}} carried out. In the mid-1990s, SAS started a scheme to cover MD-80 in single colors {{overlaid}} with small, white aircraft silhouettes, but the project was abandoned after two aircraft. As SAS {{was one of the}} main sponsors of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, it painted one aircraft in a Lillehammer '94 scheme. Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery. With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a retro Viking scheme.|$|E
5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> {{centre of the}} American armed forces and {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, missing their {{inspirational}} captain Tim Mack, and {{up against}} some vociferous northern support, Team USA were never in contention <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> went into <b>the</b> lead early {{on day one}} and never relinquished it.|$|R
50|$|In {{a certain}} way, the demonization had {{sometimes}} a positive side. For example, during Catholic missions in South America, the demonization of indigenous beliefs or acts make those peoples {{be regarded as}} so human <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of José Manuel Barroso <b>as</b> President of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Commission in 2004, GOPA was {{restructured}} and rebranded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Bureau of <b>European</b> Policy Advisers (BEPA).|$|R
5|$|Air-Cobot is {{presented}} as the first robot able to perform visual inspections of aircraft. Inspection robots using other types of sensors have been considered before, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> project Robair. Since {{the launch of the}} project, other solutions based on image processing began to be developed, such as EasyJet with a drone or the swarm of drones from Toulouse company Donecle or the Aircam project of the aerospace manufacturer Airbus.|$|E
5|$|As {{concerns}} intensified {{in early}} 2010 and thereafter, leading European nations implemented {{a series of}} financial support measures such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering interest rates and providing cheap loans {{of more than one}} trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks. On 6 September 2012, the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, through some yield lowering Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{owners of}} the area are the Dja Dja Wurrung or Jaara people {{who are part of}} the larger [...] Kulin nation. The Jaara people suffered badly when gold was discovered and their population dropped dramatically <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> converted more land to mining.|$|R

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} jaguar is most {{closely related to}} the leopard. However, DNA evidence is inconclusive and the position of the jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies. Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar. Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E
5|$|Betula pendula, {{commonly}} known as silver birch, warty birch or East Asian white birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia {{in the mountains of}} northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> white birch, and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and in parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Futebol Clube do Porto, an {{association}} football team based in Porto, {{is the most}} successful Portuguese team in international club competitions. They have won two UEFA Champions League titles (in 1987, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Cup, and 2004), two UEFA Europa League titles (in 2003, as the UEFA Cup, and 2011), one UEFA Super Cup (in 1987), and two Intercontinental Cups (in 1987 and 2004), {{for a total of}} seven international trophies. In addition, they were Cup Winners' Cup runners-up in 1984 – their first European final – and lost three other UEFA Super Cup matches, in 2003, 2004, and 2011.|$|E

5|$|Many {{regional}} {{international organisations}} such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language {{even though most}} members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.|$|E
5|$|Near human {{habitation}} {{the main}} predator {{of the common}} blackbird is the domestic cat, with newly fledged young especially vulnerable. Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises. However, there is little direct {{evidence to show that}} either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> magpie or Eurasian jay, decrease population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Official bodies such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Centre for the Validation of Alternative Test Methods of the European Commission, the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods in the US, ZEBET in Germany, and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (among others) also {{promote and}} {{disseminate}} the 3Rs. These bodies are mainly driven by responding to regulatory requirements, such as supporting the cosmetics testing ban in the EU by validating alternative methods.|$|E

5|$|P. l. spelaea or P. spelaea, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> cave lion, Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, {{occurred}} in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago. This species is known from Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts, indicating it had protruding ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes. A few had a ruff or primitive mane around their necks, possibly indicating males, but many scenes show hunting behavior (which {{would be the}} females).|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} maggots such as blowfly larvae (gentles) and {{bluebottle}} larvae (casters) are bred commercially; they are sold as bait in angling, and as food for carnivorous animals (kept as pets, in zoos, or for research) such as some mammals, fishes, reptiles, and birds It {{has been suggested}} that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|Starr {{released}} the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, {{coinciding with the}} start of Liverpool's year <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.|$|E
