5000|$|S. 1406, {{introduced}} July 31, 2013, a bill {{to permit}} the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for the issuance of permits for people hired {{for the management of}} horse shows, exhibitions, auctions, and sales, requiring all such individuals to be qualified to identify instances of soring. Individuals receiving the permits must be cleared of any potential conflicts of interest and preference is to be given to accredited veterinarians. The bill further makes it a crime for any person to sell, auction, exhibit, or race any sore horse, and bans Tennessee Walking Horses, Racking horses, and Spotted Saddle horses from being sold, auctioned, exhibited, or raced if they are equipped with any <b>action</b> <b>device</b> (which the bill defines) or equipment that would alter the gait of the horse. A companion bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives as H.R. 1518.|$|E
5000|$|Stacks are {{composed}} of multiple hoof-shaped pads, (wafer-like hoof-shaped objects) usually made of plastic, although {{they can also be}} made of leather, rubber or polyurethane. Ordinary pads are added under a horse's natural hoof, with a horseshoe at ground level. While single, relatively thin pads, either flat or with a small wedge-shaped, are used with horseshoes in many circumstances and can protect the sole of the hoof or make simple alterations to action. But in this context, as an <b>action</b> <b>device,</b> stacks (also called [...] "performance packages") are built-up sets of multiple pads, sometimes of a combination of materials, and can even be made of wood. They vary in height; they may be up to 4 in thick in the heel and no more than 2 in thick in the toe. Pads that are built up on a horseshoe have a metal band that runs across the front of the hoof to help keep them on the horse's foot. This design is an extension of a base shoe, and can be taken off or changed without having to completely re-shoe the horse. While the design is intended to exaggerate the horse's action, the shape of the stacks and added weight to the horse’s foot cause the foot to strike with more force and at an abnormal angle. [...] Soring occurs when items are concealed between the pad and hoof such that painful pressure occurs to the sole of the hoof making the horse lift its feet faster and higher. [...] Permissible thickness` and weight vary between categories of competition.|$|E

Stacks and <b>action</b> <b>devices</b> are prohibited at shows sanctioned by the United States Equestrian Federation and some breed organizations. The Tennessee Walking Horse is the breed most affected by the Horse Protection Act of 1970, which prohibits the practice of soring, abusive practices used to enhance the Big Lick movement prized in the show ring, which still occur today despite the law.

40|$|Following Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s enactment, group-based {{employment}} discrimination actions flourished due to disparate {{impact theory}} and the class <b>action</b> <b>device.</b> Courts recognized that subordination that defined a group 2 ̆ 7 s social identity was also sufficient legally to bind members together, even when relief had to be issued individually. Woven through these cases was a notion of panethnicity that united inherently unrelated groups into a common identity, for example, Asian Americans. Stringent judicial interpretation subsequently eroded both legal frameworks {{and it has become}} increasingly difficult to assert collective employment actions, even against discriminatory practices affecting an entire group. This deconstruction has immensely disadvantaged persons with disabilities. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), individual employee claims to accommodate specific impairments, such as whether to install ramps or replace computer screens, have all but eclipsed a coherent theory of disability based disparate impact law. Moreover, the class <b>action</b> <b>device</b> has been virtually nonexistent in disability discrimination employment cases. The absence of collective action has been especially harmful because the realm of the workplace is precisely where group-based remedies are needed most. Specifically, a crucial but overlooked issue in disability integration is the harder-to-reach embedded norms that require job and policy modifications. The Article argues that pandisability theory serves as an analogue to earlier notions of panethnicity and provides an equally compelling heuristic for determining class identity. It shows that pandisability undergirds ADA public service and public accommodation class actions in which individualized remedy assessments have been accepted as part of group-based challenges to social exclusion. The Article also demonstrates that this broader vision of collective action is consistent with the history underlying the class <b>action</b> <b>device.</b> Taking advantage of the relatively blank slate of writing on group-based disability discrimination, it offers an intrepid vision of the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s potential for transforming workplace environments. In advocating for a return to an earlier paradigm of collective action in the disability context, the Article also provides some thoughts on challenging race- and sex-based discrimination...|$|E

40|$|In modern {{class action}} practice, the class <b>action</b> <b>device</b> can {{enormously}} expand {{the availability of}} justice but can also cause substantial injustice to defendants and absent class members when improperly used. The latter {{is often the case}} because Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure has come to be interpreted by the federal courts in ways that mask the proper criteria that should be used in deciding whether to certify a class action. Thus, Rule 23 needs a complete overhaul. First, Rule 23 should be amended to allow appeals as of right, not discretion, from orders granting or denying class actions to be certified. Second, the federal class action rule should be redrafted to allow for a more functional definition of permissible class actions and more pragmatic criteria for judging whether a given class action should be certified. Third, the rule should expressly distinguish between cases where the claims of class members are viable if pursued individually and where they are not. In addition to Rule 23, the Manual for Complex Litigation should also be revised to recommend certain best practices in the management of class actions. Where appropriate, a second judge should be appointed to assist the trial judge as a judicial guardian ad litem for the class to protect the interests of absent class members. Enacting these revisions to the class <b>action</b> <b>device</b> and expanding judicial oversight over class actions will better accomplish the purposes for which the rule was intended...|$|E

40|$|Once a {{preserve}} of the American legal landscape, the class <b>action</b> <b>device</b> today transcends geographic boundaries. In the past decade, efforts have intensified to establish collective litigation instruments in diverse legal terrains outside the United States - including Europe - {{often with the}} common goal of allowing some form of collective legal redress while avoiding perceived disadvantages of class actions in the American experience. Today more than ever, from legislators to litigants to scholars, European reformers face the challenge - and the opportunity - of making fundamental choices about the scope {{and shape of the}} collective legal remedies they wish to make available. Choices about the shape of the class <b>action</b> <b>device</b> reflect foundational judgments about the proper allocation of costs, and there is much from the U. S. experience that can inform Europe's prospective reformers. This article describes the history and current status of class action rules in the U. S., and then compares class actions and another form of extra-compensatory damages - one type of punitive damages â as means of doing the same thing. Although neither punitive damages of this sort nor class actions generally have traditionally existed in civil law systems, they both - and especially this particular form of punitive damages - can, from an economic view, be made to vindicate the same kind of social cost accounting goals. By considering these legal devices together, we hope to shed light on crucial choices facing Europe as it grapples with how best to provide collective legal redress in light of the lessons of the U. S. experience with class actions. Class actions, Collective legal redress, Punitive damages, Extra-compensatory damages, Allocation of costs, Deterrence...|$|E

It is generally agreed that without the proper countermeasures in place, use of agent-based applications will be severely impeded.

Instead, countermeasures are applied commensurate with the anticipated threat profile and intended security objectives for the application. While countermeasures typically include any <b>action,</b> <b>device,</b> procedure, technique, or other measure that reduces the vulnerability of or threat to a system, our focus here is specifically on technical mechanisms, as opposed to procedural or non-technical measures.

In Wholesale Justice, Professor Redish provides a thorough analysis of the constitutional implications of the class action mechanism. Unlike prior commentators and courts, which have focused mainly on limited constitutional issues arising in class action cases, Professor Redish’s analysis sweeps more broadly. In the process, he brings to bear principles of constitutional law that have long lain dormant in the field of class action practice.
