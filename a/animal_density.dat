40|$|The {{impact of}} {{ungulate}} herbivores on tree regeneration and its possible consequences for long-term forest dynamics has raised concerns worldwide. In many countries, ungulate management aims at constant <b>animal</b> <b>densities,</b> whereas unmanaged ungulate populations tend to fluctuate over time. The ecosystem consequences of constant vs. varying ungulate densities are largely unknown, and the exact density that is acceptable from a forestry {{point of view}} is highly uncertain as well. We used the gap model ForClim v 2. 9. 5 {{to examine the effects of}} three browsing-related phenomena: (a) temporal changes in <b>animal</b> <b>densities</b> and thus oscillations in browsing intensity; (b) changes in the importance of browsing as a limiting factor relative to other limitations for ingrowth; and (c) growth suppression by browsing and hence different ingrowth rates for slow- vs. fast-growing trees. Results showed that ungulate herbivory can induce profound compositional and structural changes in forest stands: (a) oscillations in the browsing intensity led to compositional shifts that were less severe than under the corresponding constant browsing intensity; (b) an increase in the importance of browsing relative to other environmental factors caused a decrease in the incidence of palatable species; and (c) growth suppression strongly affected the numbers and composition of small trees of all species. We conclude that browsing can cause a shift not only in the structure and composition of tree regeneration, but also of the upper canopy in the long term. Management can manipulate forest ecosystems through the control of <b>animal</b> <b>densities,</b> and our results suggest that alternative management strategies for ungulate populations may be worth considering so as to provide “windows of opportunity” for forest regeneration in time and/or space...|$|R

Using time series from 1979 to 2013, I investigated sex-specific adult population growth rates and mortality indices (based on carcass counts) of Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) to explain variation in adult sex ratio in response to climate variability and <b>animal</b> <b>density.</b> Food limitation due to harsh winter conditions and high <b>animal</b> <b>density</b> was {{expected to have a}} stronger effect on males relative to females due to a higher energy requirement related to body size and reproductive strategy. Accordingly, when accounting for the delayed effect of population-level fecundity (i. e. input from new cohorts) and the positive effect of summer temperature (directly determining vascular plant biomass), I found that increased winter precipitation (i. e. reduced forage accessibility) had a stronger negative effect on adult population growth rate in males than in females. Additionally, the mortality index increased more strongly in response to increased winter precipitation in males than in females. Increased winter precipitation, therefore, lead to a more female-biased ASR. High <b>animal</b> <b>density,</b> however, had a stronger negative effect on female adult population growth rate and increased the mortality index more strongly in females than in males, which could be related to sex-differences in density-dependent age structure.

40|$|A {{model of}} plant and large {{herbivore}} dynamics is presented in which individual animal intake is limited by either diet digestibility (DIG) or forage availability and in which grazing can result in sward heterogeneity. The model is used to illustrate the interaction between <b>animal</b> <b>density,</b> plant dynamics, sward heterogeneity and diet selection strategy and how this subsequently feeds back to affect animal intake and sward heterogeneity. Two contrasting diet selection strategies were simulated; selection for maximum instantaneous intake of mass (IR) and selection for DIG. For both diet selection strategies, individual animal intake initially increased with increasing <b>animal</b> <b>density,</b> as intake was limited by DIG and the greater frequency of defoliation maintained the sward in a more juvenile and digestible state. As <b>animal</b> <b>density</b> increased further, a point was reached at which intake became limited by forage availability and individual animal intake fell thereafter. The DIG strategy resulted in a higher daily intake than the IR strategy when grazing pressure was low. Here, intake was limited by digestibility and the DIG strategy led by repeated defoliation, {{to the maintenance of}} a small proportion of the sward in a state of high digestibility. The model was further used to show that selection for a strategy of long-term optimisation of sward structure through modulation of bite depth is unlikely. The model highlights the potential plasticity of the grazing process and the need to include plant dynamics in models of large herbivore-plant interactions...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Recent {{epizootics}} {{of highly}} contagious OIE List A diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, {{classical swine fever}} and avian influenza (AI), led {{to the implementation of}} stamping-out policies resulting in the depopulation of millions of animals. The enforcement of a control strategy that is based only on the application of sanitary restrictions on farms and that involves the culling of animals that are infected, suspected of being infected or suspected of being contaminated, may not be sufficient to avoid the spread of infection, particularly in areas that have high <b>animal</b> <b>densities,</b> and thus results in mass depopulation. In the European Union, the directive that imposes the enforcement of a stamping-out policy (92 / 40 /EC) for AI was adopted in 1992, although it was drafted in the 1980 s. The poultry industry has undergone substantial changes in the past 20 years, mainly resulting in shorter production cycles and in greater <b>animal</b> <b>densities</b> per territorial unit.

40|$|Reliable {{estimates}} of great ape abundance {{are needed to}} assess distribution, monitor population status, evaluate conservation tactics, and identify priority populations for conservation. Rather than using direct counts, surveyors often count ape nests. The standing crop nest count (SCNC) method converts the standing stock of nests into <b>animal</b> <b>densities</b> using a set of parameters, including nest decay rate. Nest decay rates vary greatly over space and time, and it takes months to calculate a site-specific value. The marked nest count (MNC) method circumvents this issue and only counts new nests produced during a defined period. We compared orangutan densities calculated by the two methods using data from studies in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia. We show how <b>animal</b> <b>densities</b> calculated using nest counts should be cautiously interpreted when used {{to make decisions about}} management or budget allocation. Even with site-specific decay rates, short studies using the SCNC method may not accurately reflect the current population unless conducted at a scale sufficient to include wide-ranging orangutan movement. Density estimates from short studies using the MNC method were affected by small sample sizes and by orangutan movement. To produce reliable results, the MNC method may require a similar amount of effort as the SCNC method. We suggest a reduced reliance on the traditional line transect surveys in favor of feasible alternative methods when absolute abundance numbers are not necessary or when site-specific nest decay rates are not known.

40|$|Reliable {{estimation}} of the size or density of wild animal populations {{is very important for}} effective wildlife management, conservation and ecology. Currently, the most widely used methods for obtaining such estimates involve either sighting animals from transect lines or some form of capture-recapture on marked or uniquely identifiable individuals. However, many species are difficult to sight, and cannot be easily marked or recaptured. Some of these species produce readily identifiable sounds, providing an opportunity to use passive acoustic data to estimate <b>animal</b> <b>density.</b> In addition, even for species for which other visually based methods are feasible, passive acoustic methods offer the potential for greater detection ranges in some environments (e. g. underwater or in dense forest), and hence potentially better precision.

40|$|Distance {{sampling}} is extensively {{used for}} estimating <b>animal</b> <b>density</b> or abundance. Conventional methods assume that location of line or point transects is random {{with respect to}} the animal population, yet transects are often placed along linear features such as roads, rivers or shorelines that do not randomly sample the study region, resulting in biased estimates of abundance. If it is possible to collect additional data that allow an <b>animal</b> <b>density</b> gradient {{with respect to the}} transects to be modelled, we show how to extend the conventional distance sampling likelihood to give asymptotically unbiased estimates of density for the covered area. We illustrate the proposed methods using data for a kangaroo population surveyed by line transects laid along tracks, for which the true density is known from an independent source, and the density gradient with respect to the tracks is estimated from a sample of GPS collared animals. For this example, density of animals increases with distance from the tracks, so that detection probability is overestimated and density underestimated if the non-random location of transects is ignored. When we account for the density gradient, {{there is no evidence of}} bias in the abundance estimate. We end with a list of practical recommendations to investigators conducting distance sampling surveys where density gradients could be an issue...|$|E

Farm characteristics which serve as a proxy for the marginal value of rented acreage for the tenant as well as variables which represent local competition on the land market are significant. Among the farm characteristics, operating revenue per hectare, share of high-value crops, soil quality, share of rented acreage, share of arable land relative to rented acreage, and <b>animal</b> <b>density</b> are significant while, ceteris paribus, neither labour nor machinery/buildings per hectare nor farm size are significant.
