25|$|Gosnell {{owned and}} {{operated}} the Women's Medical Society clinic in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania {{and he was a}} prolific prescriber of OxyContin. In 2011, Gosnell and various co-defendant employees were charged with eight counts of murder, 24 felony counts of performing illegal abortions beyond the state of Pennsylvania’s 24-week time limit, and 227 misdemeanor counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law. The murder charges related to an adult patient, Karnamaya Mongar, who died following an <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure,</b> and seven newborns said to have been killed by having their spinal cords severed with scissors after being born alive during attempted abortions. In May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced instead to life in prison without the possibility of parole.|$|E

500|$|Coming from a {{relatively}} Catholic district, Neal {{has a more}} conservative record {{on the issue of}} abortion than other Massachusetts representatives. He said in 2010, [...] "I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I'd keep Roe v. Wade and restrict it, I've always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [...] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I'm mixed and guess what? That's where the American people are." [...] He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> illegal in most cases. During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, restricting government funding of abortion. On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1990s, {{the state}} of Nebraska {{attempted}} to ban a certain second-trimester <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> known as intact dilation and extraction (sometimes called partial birth abortion).

2500|$|There {{was intense}} public debate {{throughout}} the 1980s and 1990s over legal abortion reform. [...] These debates portrayed abortion as un-Buddhist and anti-religious; abortion opponents ultimately labeled it {{as a form}} of Western corruption that was inherently anti-Thai and threatened the integrity of the nation. [...] Despite this, in 2006, abortions became legal in cases of rape or foetal impairment. [...] Mental health also became a factor in determining the legality of an <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure.</b> [...] The strict regulations involved in qualifying for a legal abortion, however, cause approximately 300,000 women a year to seek illegal avenues according to scholar Andrea Whittaker, with the poorest undergoing the most dangerous of procedures.|$|E
2500|$|A late {{termination}} of pregnancy often {{refers to an}} induced ending of pregnancy after the 20th week of gestation. The exact point when a pregnancy becomes late-term, however, is not clearly defined. Some sources define an abortion after 16 weeks as [...] "late". Three articles published in 1998 {{in the same issue}} of the Journal of the American Medical Association could not agree on the definition. Two of the JAMA articles chose the 20th week of gestation to be the point where an <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> would be considered late-term.Grimes, D.A.

2500|$|The {{plurality}} opinion {{stated that it}} was upholding what it called the [...] "essential holding" [...] of Roe.

The plurality asserted that the fundamental right to abortion is grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the plurality reiterated what the Court had said in Eisenstadt v. Baird: [...] "f the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nina Eliade {{fell ill}} with uterine cancer and died during their stay in Lisbon, in late 1944. As the widower later wrote, {{the disease was}} {{probably}} caused by an <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> she had undergone {{at an early stage}} of their relationship. He came to suffer from clinical depression, which increased as Romania and her Axis allies suffered major defeats on the Eastern Front. Contemplating a return to Romania as a soldier or a monk, he was on a continuous search for effective antidepressants, medicating himself with passion flower extract, and, eventually, with methamphetamine. This was probably not his first experience with drugs: vague mentions in his notebooks have been read as indication that Mircea Eliade was taking opium during his travels to Calcutta. Later, discussing the works of Aldous Huxley, Eliade wrote that the British author's use of mescaline as a source of inspiration had something in common with his own experience, indicating 1945 as a date of reference and adding that it was [...] "needless to explain why that is".|$|E
2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{that the right}} to abortion was not unlimited, Justice Blackmun, speaking for the Court, created a trimester framework to balance the fundamental right to abortion with the government's two legitimate interests: protecting the mother's health and protecting the [...] "potentiality of human life." [...] The trimester framework addressed when a woman's fundamental right to abortion would be absolute, and when the state's interests would become compelling. In the first trimester, when it was believed that the procedure was safer than childbirth, the Court left the decision to abort completely to the woman and her physician. From approximately {{the end of the first}} trimester until fetal viability, the state's interest in protecting the health of the mother would become [...] "compelling." [...] At that time, the state could regulate the <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> if the regulation [...] "reasonably relate to the [...] "preservation and protection of maternal health." [...] At the point of viability, which the Court believed to be in the third trimester, the state's interest in [...] "potential life" [...] would become compelling, and the state could regulate abortion to protect [...] "potential life." [...] At that point, the state could even forbid abortion so long as it made an exception to preserve the life or health of the mother. The Court added that the primary right being preserved in the Roe decision was that of the physician to practice medicine freely absent a compelling state interest – not women's rights in general. In 1992, however, the plurality of Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter, and Anthony Kennedy made a subtle move away from the physician's-rights approach of Roe and toward a patient's-rights approach in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The plurality in Casey, explicitly confirming that women had a constitutional right to abortion and further upholding the [...] "essential holding" [...] of Roe, stated that women had a right to choose abortion before viability and that this right could not be unduly interfered with by the state. They asserted that this right was rooted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
