40|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>tars</b> are waste {{residues}} of obsolete benzole refining, oil re-refining {{and white}} oil production processes. They are black, acidic, viscous semi-liquids comprising an extremely complex mixture of water, sulfuric acid {{and a large}} range of organic compounds. <b>Acid</b> <b>tars</b> were often dumped into excavations and existing holes in the ground together with various co-disposed materials without any treatment or engineered lining system leaving a legacy of acid tar lagoons. <b>Acid</b> <b>tars</b> may pose potential risks to {{human health and the}} environment because of their acidity, volatiles and other hazardous components. The major contamination pathways of acid tar lagoons are considered to be direct contact, gas emission, bulk tar migration offsite, and surface and ground water contamination. The leaching, weathering and migration behaviours of <b>acid</b> <b>tars</b> were investigated by carrying out a series of batch, cascade and flow cell tests. The results demonstrated that <b>acid</b> <b>tars</b> are capable of leaching Significant levels of contaminants if disturbed, while the leaching level is Significantly lower under simulated groundwater flow in a model soil. The time scale to leaching stabilization was of the order of months in the model soil and is expected to significantly exceed that in the natural environment. To support this work a nubmber of analytical methods for determining physical and chemical properties of <b>acid</b> <b>tars</b> had to be adapted from standard techniques. These modified techniques are described in detail together with recommendations for data integration and correlation of all analyses to form a better understanding of <b>acid</b> <b>tars</b> and their potential environmental impact. The overall findings of the research were integrated to generate a conceptual model of acid tar lagoon processes to assist in assessment. Monitored Natural Attenuation was evaluated and is considered to be a potentially viable approach to the environmental management of some acid tar lagoons...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{experienced}} {{with the land}} fill disposal of highly corrosive acid tar wastes mean that alternative, less environmentally damaging methods of disposal must be employed. The incineration of <b>acid</b> <b>tars,</b> although possessing several advantages over landfill disposal, can lead to unacceptably high SO 2 -emission concentrations in the flue gases unless precautions are taken. However, such incinerations have been achieved successfully in the present tests with a two-stage fluidised-bed combustor: the attained combustion efficiencies were high (at around 99 %). The use of a fluidised-bed combustor for burning acid tar requires that limestone {{be added to the}} bed material in order to provide some degree of sulphur capture. The sensitivity of the SO 2 emission to the limestone concentration (as indicated by the Ca: S mole ratio) fell as the Ca: S ratio was increased. At a Ca: S mole ratio of 4 : 1, 91 % sulphur retention was achieved. During this test, 340 kg/h acid tar was pumped into the bed and burnt there successfully with 98 kg/h coal: the bed's temperature and height, and the excess oxygen-in-flue concentration were kept constant. Ultimately, average SO 2 emission-levels (in the flue gas) of around 417 ppm were thereby achieved; i. e., well below the 600 ppm SO 2 -emission limit stipulated by the Commission of the European Communities. Nevertheless, the fluctuations in the SO 2 emissions meant that a slightly higher Ca: S ratio of 5 : 1 was recommended {{in order to ensure that}} the emission levels were consistently below the required limit, i. e., such that 97 % of all the mean 48 -hourly values would not exceed 110 % of the stipulated emission limit. ...|$|E
40|$|Pyrolysis is an {{attractive}} thermochemical conversion technology that may be utilised as a safe disposal option for <b>acid</b> <b>tar</b> waste. The kinetics of <b>acid</b> <b>tar</b> pyrolysis were investigated using thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry under a nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 K min(- 1). The thermogravimetric analysis shows three major reaction peaks centred around 178 degrees C, 258 degrees C, and 336 degrees C corresponding to the successive degradation of water soluble lower molecular mass sulphonic acids, sulphonated high molecular mass hydrocarbons, and high molecular mass hydrocarbons. The kinetic parameters were evaluated using the iso-conversional Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method. A variation in the activation energy with conversion revealed that the pyrolysis of the <b>acid</b> <b>tar</b> waste progresses through complex multi-step kinetics.

The work presented in this thesis concerns one particular <b>acid</b> <b>tar</b> lagoon situated in the North West of England which arose as a result of deposition of waste from benzole refining. The effects on microbial diversity of a combination of low pH and high levels of organic pollutants were investigated using samples taken from various locations within this lagoon.

Following microbial diversity analysis a detailed examination of two specific organisms isolated from lagoon samples was carried out in order to understand some of the mechanisms of survival and tolerance to such an extreme environment. An acidotolerant unicellular alga which appears to form a large biofilm in several areas of the lagoon, Euglena gracilis G 46, and an acidophilic bacterium, Acidocella 29, were the focus ofthis aspect ofthe work.

The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the <b>tar</b> <b>acids</b> won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%.

Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons.

All of these have antiseptic properties. The <b>tar</b> <b>acids</b> are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives.

40|$|The Grillo {{process is}} {{designed}} to produce sulphur dioxide from solid and liquid sulphur, spent sulphuric acids and other high-calorific-value waste materials of the chemical industry. The raw materials used are converted in a rotary kiln with a moving coke bed at approximately 1000 °C under a weak reducing atmosphere; the hydrocarbon compounds are cracked and sulphur is converted into SO 2. To supply additional energy, the rotary kiln is fitted with an oil burner. After passing through post-combustion chambers, the product gases from the decomposition process are cooled down in a waste heat recovery boiler and fed to an absorption-desorption reactor. In there, high-purity sulphur dioxide is obtained and stored in liquid form in pressure tanks for sale. In the Grillo process both, solid and liquid sulphur, can be used separately but also simultaneously. The use of sulphur and its combustion with air represents {{the state of the}} technology. The combustion of liquid sulphur with pure oxygen combined with the decomposition process, however, has only been practiced in the Grillo process so far. This study investigates the reactions taking place in the rotary kiln, in particular the vaporisation and combustion of liquid sulphur and the separation of spent acids using thermodynamic and reaction kinetic methods. The thermodynamic-based calculation of the chemical changes and energy conversions in the Grillo process (rotary kiln – post combustion chamber – waste heat recovery boiler) is used to assess the effects of the decomposition in the rotary kiln on the entire process. The field tests on the system using a variation of the type and quantity of substances represent an important basis for the process analysis. The temperatures and gas compositions were measured continuously at the outlet of the rotary kiln, in the post-combustion chamber as well as the waste heat recovery boiler. One of the priorities of the investigation, is the combustion of liquid sulphur with oxygen, an area which has barely been investigated up to now. During the vaporisation of liquid sulphur, gaseous sulphur molecules from S 8 to S 1 are created, which make up different amounts in the gaseous phase, depending on temperature and pressure. This influences, e. g., the sulphur combustion by the oxygen supply in the rotary kiln. In addition to an oxygen supply, sustaining the sulphur flame also requires a certain droplet spectrum. A further object of investigation is the separation of spent sulphuric <b>acids,</b> <b>tar</b> <b>acids</b> and high-heat-value waste materials in the rotary kiln. The spent acids also contain hydrocarbons and heavy metal compounds, which may be present in a solute form or as independent phases, which react differently in the rotary kiln, where special effects, such as microexplosion, may occur. The soot formation frequently occurring in the gasification of hydrocarbon compounds also takes place in the rotary kiln and thus feed the coke bed, which serves as both a heat reservoir and a carbon supply in the Grillo process. This study shall describe the kinetics of vaporisation and combustion of liquid droplets on simplistic conditions. First of all, the size of the liquid droplets that enter the hot gas compartment of the rotary kiln is calculated, considering the entry conditions. The time related sequence of the substance and heat transmission processes during the heating, vaporisation, separation and combustion of sulphuric and spent acid droplets is described on the basis of simple single droplet models. In this way the maximum diameters of the droplets which can be converted in the rotary kiln are determined. Following from calculations and actual measurements, large spent acid droplets are evidently fragmented {{as a result of the}} microexplosions and can thus fully react in the rotary kiln. One of the practical objectives of this study is the control and monitoring of the overall process, going beyond the empirical field tests. This objective is served by the thermodynamic-based process calculations carried out in combination with field tests in which the chemical changes and energy conversions in the individual reactors were recorded. The quantities and compositions of the reaction products formed in both the rotary kiln and the post-combustion chambers have also been determined. While doing so, it was possible to demonstrate that the delayed conversion of substances such as <b>tar</b> <b>acids</b> can impair the energy balance in the rotary kiln and thus the entire process. All in all, the calculations in comparison with measurements have considerably improved the basis for the practice-oriented analysis and optimisation of the process in the reactor coupling comprising rotary kiln, post-combustion chamber and waste heat recovery boiler...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA (Methicillin Resistant S. aureus), is an {{acquired}} pathogen {{and the primary}} cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. In S. aureus, teichoic acid is an essential component of the cell wall, and its biosynthesis is not yet well characterized. Studies in Bacillus subtilis have discovered two different pathways of teichoic acid biosynthesis, in two strains W 23 and 168 respectively, namely teichoic <b>acid</b> ribitol (<b>tar)</b> and teichoic <b>acid</b> glycerol (tag). The genes involved in these two pathways are also characterized, tarA, tarB, tarD, tarI, tarJ, tarK, tarL for the tar pathway, and tagA, tagB, tagD, tagE, tagF for the tag pathway. With the genome sequences of several MRSA strains: Mu 50, MW 2, N 315, MRSA 252, COL as well as methicillin susceptible strain MSSA 476 available, a comparative genomic analysis was performed to characterize teichoic acid biosynthesis in these S. aureus strains. Results We identified all S. aureus tar and tag gene orthologs in the selected S. aureus strains which would contribute to teichoic acids sythesis. Based on our identification of genes orthologous to tarI, tarJ, tarL, which are specific to tar pathway in B. subtilis W 23, we also concluded that tar is the major teichoic acid biogenesis pathway in S. aureus. Further analyses indicated that the S. aureus tar genes, different from the divergon organization in B. subtilis, are organized into several clusters in cis. Most interesting, compared with genes in B. subtilis tar pathway, the S. aureus tar specific genes (tarI,J,L) are duplicated in all six S. aureus genomes. Conclusion In the S. aureus strains we analyzed, <b>tar</b> (teichoic <b>acid</b> ribitol) is the main teichoic acid biogenesis pathway. The tar genes are organized into several genomic groups in cis and the genes specific to tar (relative to tag) : tarI, tarJ, tarL are duplicated. The genomic organization of the S. aureus tar pathway suggests their regulations are different when compared to B. subtilis tar or tag pathway, which are grouped in two operons in a divergon structure. </p...|$|R

The <b>tar</b> is characterized by high carbon concentration, viscosity and high heating value. Although high, at fuel injection temperatures over 120 1 C the tar’s viscosity is likelyto be lower than diesel.

The blends are stable and readily formed. Little difference in engine performance relative to diesel was found for 20 % PT blends. PT blends (40 %) exhibit significantly higher in-cylinder gas temperature and pressure. Ignition delay for both blends is longer than diesel, as is the fuel burn rate during the premixed stage of the combustion. During the diffusion stage of combustion, the fuel burn rate is lower relative to diesel. The performance of engines fuelled by blends containing 40 % or more PTcould be improved through optimization of engine systems...|$|R

40|$|Objective and methods: This health {{technology}} assessment (HTA) report synthesises systematically randomized controlled studies (RCT) on the therapy of moderate and severe psoriasis vulgaris which were published between 1999 and 2004; it includes some important clinical studies {{which have been}} published after 2004 and thus updates the English HTA report by Griffiths et al. [1]. The major objective is {{the evaluation of the}} medical effectiveness of different therapeutical approaches and the cost effectiveness with relevance for Germany. Results: The major conclusions from the results of medical RCT on moderate and severe psoriasis vulgaris are: Oral fumarates are effective in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris. However, fumarates quiet frequently cause moderate side effects. Cyclosporine and methotrexate are both effective in the treatment of severe psoriasis vulgaris. Both substances have a different spectrum of side effects which may limit the individual applicability. Acetritin is only moderately effective in the treatment of severe psoriasis of the plaque type. Calcipotriol or UV-radiation used at the same time can increase the clinical effectiveness of acetritin. Systemic PUVA, balneo-PUVA and UVB therapy are all effective for the treatment of severe psoriasis. The combination of UV therapy with vitamin D 3 analogues or with topical steroids is more effective than the treatment with UV radiation alone. Saltwater baths increase the effectiveness of UVB therapy. No RCT on the therapeutical effects of topical tar or of dithranol in combination with UV therapy have been published so far. A continuous therapy with PUVA should not be applied due to its proven photocarcinogenicity. Three substances from the group of biologicals (Efalizumab, Etanercept, and Infliximab) are now available in Europe and a further substance (Alefacept) is available in the USA for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. All biologicals have been effective in placebo controlled studies. The substances differ in the times until a clinical effect is observable, in the spectrum of side effects and in their efficiency on psoriasis arthritis. From health-economic studies considering both costs and clinical efficiency oral fumarates appear to be superior to acitretin or cyclosporine (although cyclosporine appears to be more effective in severe psoriasis). From the health economic view methotrexate is equivalent with UVB or PUVA and superior to cyclosporine. The therapy options UVB, UVB plus calcipotriol and PUVA are equivalent and superior to balneo-phototherapy. Biologicals are cost intensive and should be used when other approaches are not sufficient or are not applicable due to their side effects. The HTA report summarizes some health-economic studies on dithranol, on calcipotriol and on the combination with tar and UV light. No RCT have been published for the treatment of severe psoriasis with these agents alone but it appears to be certain that these substances are effective in severe psoriasis as well. DiscussionThe spectrum of therapeutical options has fortunately increased during the last years. It must be emphasized that a number of therapeutical procedures exist which are not discussed in detail in this HTA. This is due to the search strategy of literature: Only RCT performed with patients with moderate and/or severe psoriasis vulgaris were included into this evaluation. This led to the exclusion of a number of substances which are traditionally used alone or in combination for the treatment of moderate or severe psoriasis vulgaris (e. g. dithranol, salicyc <b>acid,</b> <b>tar,</b> corticosteroids and topical retinoids). Moreover, other approaches which include neither drugs nor UV light are not discussed in this HTA although the authors believe in the importance of psychotherapeutical interventions, educational approaches and combined medical and non-medical approaches in rehabilitational medicine in the management of psoriasis vulgaris. The transferability of the health economic evaluations is strongly limited by the fact that all included health economic evaluations except one were not aligned to a German setting. A future research question will be the evaluation of the duration of remission and relapse ratios in the context of different therapy options of moderate and severe psoriasis. Moreover, the consideration of combined outcomes such as the improvement of psoriatic symptoms and the decrease of symptoms in accompanying psoriasis arthritis represents a future requirement of health assessment. Conclusions: From the clinical point of view it is positive that the spectrum of therapeutic procedures for a chronic severe skin disease has increased continuously during the last years. In cases of individual contraindications or individual inefficacies it is now possible to try alternative approaches. Moreover the risk of long-term side effects can be reduced by changing the therapeutical procedure after some time (so-called rotation therapy). The therapeutical algorithm for severe psoriasis vulgaris now includes photo(chemo-) therapy in combination with topical substances, oral fumaric acid esters, retinoids (in combination with phototherapy or topical substances), methotrexate, cylosporine and the new biologics. Future studies should address therapeutical approaches which can not easily be studied by RCT, e. g. physical, balneological, climate approaches, educational programs and complex rehabilitation therapy which all may have positive effects on individuals with severe psoriasis. As in medical therapy management of moderate and severe psoriasis the economic evaluation also points out the way of a strategic therapy concept which corresponds to a large extent to the algorithm in medical practice...|$|R
40|$|Since their discovery, {{nucleic acids}} {{have been the}} object of intense and {{thorough}} explorations, leading {{to the understanding of}} their structure and functions. Their role as genetic information carriers is well known but there are evidences that they are also involved in a series of other less known processes. No longer have nucleic acids to be considered passive structures, but they are dynamic and active macromolecules, able to assume a number of three-dimensional conformations. Precisely, the conformation of nucleic acids, encoded in their primary sequence, is the component that determines the specific and selective interaction with a biological target. This work is essentially divided in two parts reflecting the dual nature of nucleic acids and aimed at developing two different projects, one where nucleic acids represent a valid target for new potential therapeutic agents and the other where nucleic acids, playing {{an active role in the}} protein recognition, are developed as diagnostic agents. The first part of my PhD research activity is included in a wider project aimed to identify potential antiviral agents able to interfere with the NC chaperone activity. NC has multiple functions during the HIV- 1 replication cycle and, in particular, the chaperone activity of NC is critical in reverse transcription. The recombinant full-length NC protein and its biological activity were deeply characterized: the analysis of the NC structure was completed by circular dichroic spectroscopy (CD). Then, the chaperone activity of NC i. e. its ability to destabilize the secondary structures of the viral nucleic <b>acids</b> <b>TAR</b> and cTAR was evaluated by a Fluorescence Assay and a FRET assay; NC aggregating activity was instead monitored through gel electrophoresis that allowed us to analyze the TAR/cTAR annealing reaction in the presence of the full-length NC protein. The effect of compounds on the chaperone activity of NC was investigated: to achieve this goal, a simple, fast and highly reproducible FRET-based assay for the High Throughput Screening (HTS) of inhibitors of the NC nucleic acids destabilization activity was optimized. A wide range of small molecules with different chemical structures from our in-house chemical library were analyzed, and in this work we focus on molecules with intercalating ability. 2, 6 -dipeptidyl anthraquinones, known DNA and RNA binders, were analysed as potential NC inhibitors: they could interfere with NC chaperone activity thanks to their attitude of stabilize the secondary structures of RNA and DNA sequences involved in the retrotranscription process. The effect of anthraquinones (series Z, GSF and G) on the chaperone activity of NC was investigated by HTS and the IC 50 values on TAR and cTAR were determined for each compound. All tested anthraquinones are active both toward TAR and cTAR: the proposed mechanism of action for anthraquinones was therefore studied in more details by Melting Assays (FRET probes coupled to thermal melting experiments). We analyzed the ability of each compound to bind and stabilize the secondary structure of cTAR, TAR and of the TAR/cTAR hybrid. Melting Assay data supported HTS results, since the most active inhibitors of the chaperone NC activity resulted to be also strong TAR and cTAR stabilizers. Finally, we analyzed by native gel electrophoresis the effect of the most promising anthraquinones on the NC-mediated annealing of TAR with cTAR, to verify the effectiveness of the inhibition of the NC chaperone activity during the step subsequent to TAR and cTAR melting. All the tested anthraquinones resulted to be inhibitors of the TAR/cTAR hybrid formation, according with the NC inhibitory activity analyzed by HTS. Hence, viral nucleic acids involved in reverse transcription represent a new validated target for anti-HIV drugs design and 2, 6 -dipeptydil anthraquinones were identified as highly active anti-NC compounds which could be further analyzed to be developed as new potential antiviral agents. Moreover, a promising class of anti-HIV agents is represented by compounds which interfere with the Tat-mediated transcription process of the viral replicative cycle. Two classes of compounds were studied as inhibitors of the Tat-TAR complex formation. Quinolones are a promising class of anti-HIV compounds which interfere with the Tat mediated transcription process. To provide new insights into the SAR of antiviral quinolones, WP and HP series were analyzed by Fluorescence Quanching Assay (FQA), a FRET-based platform of screening that allowed the determination of the inhibition constant Ki for each compound. All the tested 6 -DFQs of WP series are active as Tat-TAR complex formation inhibitors, with Ki values lower than the control WM 5. WP series differs from the control for modifications introduced at the N 1 position: these modifications do not result in loss of activity, but rather seem to improve the activity of WP quinolones as inhibitors of the Tat-TAR complex formation. The second class of compounds tested as inhibitors of the Tat-TAR complex formation was constituted by ellagic acid and some synthetic bi- and mono-lactones derivatives. ELs analysis was not possible to be performed by FQA due to a quenching effect observing after the addition of ELs to fluoresceinated Tat. The analysis of the ELs interference on the Tat-TAR complex was therefore performed by EMSA. Compound 1186 can act as Tat-TAR complex formation inhibitor and therefore supports the potential anti-HIV activity of ELs. The second part of my research work is focused on the development, optimization and characterization of a novel sensing system with therapeutic and diagnostic interest employing nucleic acids aptamers for the detection of proteins involved in diverse diseases. Biosensors based on the use of aptamers for specific recognition of an analyte are called "aptasensors". We developed the Sandwich Aptamer Microarray (SAM) with the aim to replace the traditional immunochemical systems used as diagnostics. SAM is a system ELISA-like, using a similar architecture, but totally based on aptamer technology with a "primary aptamer" as selection element and a "secondary aptamer" as a signal transducer. Two DNA aptamers with distinct protein recognition patterns are used in tandem for the simultaneous recognition of the target protein. We developed an aptamer-based microarray for human thrombin detection exploiting two non-overlapping DNA thrombin binding aptamers recognizing different exosites of the target protein. The 15 -mer aptamer (TBA 1) binds the fibrinogen-binding site, whereas the 29 -mer aptamer (TBA 2) binds the heparin binding domain. Appropriate chemical modifications were introduced in primary and secondary aptamers to adapt them to the format design and to the detection technology. Extensive analysis on the complex formation between human thrombin and modified aptamers was performed by EMSA, in order to verify in solution whether the chemical modifications introduced would affect aptamers/protein recognition. The validated system was then applied to the aptamer microarray, using the solid phase system devised by the solution studies. Our SAM system based on aptamer recognition of an analyte resulted to be efficient and specific, and different detection aptamers and methods can be utilized. The use of the indirect method (TBA 2 - biotin plus Cy 3 -streptavidin) allows lower LOD and LOQ when compared to TBA 2 -Cy 5 (direct method) even in the presence of biological fluids. SAM exhibits a limit of detection comparable to other systems described in the literature employing the same aptamers and different technologies but has the advantage of a simple set up. In view of future applications of SAM in multiplex microarray systems, we enlarged the SAM system analysis on the VEGF 165 detection using two anti-VEGF 165 aptamers that recognize different sites of the protein. Following the same approach adopted for thrombin, a deep analysis and optimization of binary and ternary complexes formation between the modified anti-VEGF 165 aptamers and VEGF 165 in solution was performed prior to verify the sandwich aptamer formation in solid phase. The sandwich aptamer formation was verified also for VEGF 165. This pioneering work suggests that SAM, developed for thrombin and VEGF 165 detection, could represent a useful tool to monitor protein concentration in blood or plasma and represents a potential application of aptamers in diagnostic. ...|$|R
50|$|Shampoo {{intended}} for animals may contain insecticides or other medications {{for treatment of}} skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special {{care must be taken}} not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended {{to do more than just}} clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas.The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats).Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur.Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic <b>acid,</b> refined <b>tar</b> (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone.Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos.Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of heating rates on the fundamental properties of vinegar during bamboo carbonization. Applications of bamboo vinegars on inhibit plant pathogenic bacteria, and the synergism of bamboo vinegar combined with chitosan a bacteriostatic action was also studied. Thirty-two kinds of moso bamboo vinegar were collected using a steel kiln under various conditions of temperature range from 150 ~ 200 ℃, 200 ~ 250 ℃, 250 ~ 300 ℃, 300 ~ 350 ℃, 350 ~ 400 ℃, 400 ~ 450 ℃, 450 ~ 500 ℃, and from 150 ~ 500 ℃ at heating rates of 25, 50, 75, and 100 ℃/hr, respectively. The fundamental properties including total yields, color, pH, specific gravity, organic acid content, and soluble tar content in bamboo vinegars were examined. The results showed that the yields of bamboo vinegars was about 10 ％, and the yields decreased with increasing of heating rate. More than 77 ％ of total bamboo vinegars were collected at the temperature range from 150 ~ 300 ℃. The bamboo vinegars collected from 250 ~ 300 ℃ and 150 ~ 500 ℃ had the darkest color, and from 200 ~ 250 ℃ had the lowest pH, and from 250 ~ 300 ℃ had the highest amount of organic <b>acid</b> and soluble <b>tar</b> content. However, the specific gravity of bamboo vinegars increased with increasing the collected temperature. In addition, the organic constituents of bamboo vinegars by GC-MS analysis showed that major products in bamboo vinegars were acid components in all treatments, and the amount of acid components decreased with increasing the heating rate. However, the neutral components and the phenol components increased and became more complicated in their chemical structures with increasing the heating rate. Moreover, the results of GC-MS analysis reviewed that the major constituent in acid components was acetic acid, and the neutral components were cyclopentanol and butyrolactone, and phenol components were 2, 6 -dimethoxy-phenol and phenol. In order to understand the antibacterial activity of bamboo vinegars, five plant pathogenic bacteria including bacterial wilt of tomato, bacterial blight of rice, black rot of crucifers, bacterial spot of carambola, and bacterial blotch of cucurbits were investigated by disc agar diffusion test method and dilution method. The results showed that bamboo vinegars could effectively inhibit the grown of plant pathogenic bacteria. Consideration of the percentage of inhibition and yield of bamboo vinegars, the best manufacturing conditions of bamboo vinegars against the growth of plant pathogenic bacteria were the temperature range of 150 ~ 500 ℃ at heating rates of 25 and 50 ℃/hr, or the collecting temperature over 250 ℃ at heating rates of 75 and 100 ℃/hr. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bamboo vinegars against plant pathogenic bacteria were 500 ~ 700 times dilution of original vinegar which collected from 150 ~ 500 ℃ at heating rate of 25 ℃/hr. Meanwhile, the synergy effect of chitosan and bamboo vinegar on inhibit the grown of plant pathogenic bacteria was also observed, better results were shown in the mixtures of bamboo vinegars and higher degree of deacetylation and higher concentration of chitosan. 本研究係探討不同炭化升溫速率和不同收集溫度範圍竹醋液之基本性質，並分析竹醋液對抑制植物病原細菌之效果，及幾丁聚醣和竹醋液抑菌之協同作用。將孟宗竹以機械窯依 25 、 50 、 75 和 100 ℃/hr等 4 種炭化升溫速率炭化，分段收集 150 ~ 200 ℃、 200 ~ 250 ℃、 250 ~ 300 ℃、 300 ~ 350 ℃、 350 ~ 400 ℃、 400 ~ 450 ℃及 450 ~ 500 ℃等溫度範圍與不分溫度範圍 150 ~ 500 ℃一次收集之 32 種竹醋液，分別探討其收率、顏色、pH值、比重、有機酸含量、溶解焦油含量及組成分等基本性質。試驗結果得知，竹醋液總收率隨升溫速率上升而下降，約佔 10 ％左右，主要收集之百分率集中在 150 ~ 300 ℃，可達總收率之 77 ％以上；不論在何種炭化升溫速率下，竹醋液之顏色以分段收集之 250 ~ 300 ℃及一次收集之 150 ~ 500 ℃者為最深，pH值則以 200 ~ 250 ℃者最低，比重隨收集溫度範圍上升而增加，有機酸和溶解焦油含量以 250 ~ 300 ℃者為最多。以氣相層析-質譜儀（GC-MS）分析得知，竹醋液有機成分，不論何種炭化升溫速率之各種溫度範圍均以acetic acid（醋酸）為主之酸性物質最多，隨著升溫速率上升酸性物質含量明顯減少，而中性物質與酚類物質含量卻增加，種類亦更多元，又中性物質主要成分為環戊醇（cyclopentanol）和丁酸內酯（butyrolactone），而酚類物質以 2, 6 -雙甲氧基酚（ 2, 6 -dimethoxy-phenol）和酚（phenol）為主。 採用瓊脂紙錠擴散試驗法和稀釋試驗法分析竹醋液抑制植物病原細菌（包括番茄青枯病菌、水稻白葉枯病菌、十字花科黑腐病菌、楊桃細菌性斑點病菌和瓜類細菌性果斑病菌系 5 種）之效能，由試驗結果得知，竹醋液可有效抑制植物病原細菌之生長，綜合抑菌率及竹醋液的收率，建議採用升溫速率 25 和 50 ℃/hr之 150 ~ 500 ℃一次收集者，或升溫速率 75 和 100 ℃/hr於 250 ℃以後溫度收集之竹醋液，對抑制植物病原細菌最具效果。又以升溫速率 25 ℃/hr之一次收集竹醋液為例，其最低抑制濃度約為 500 ~ 700 倍竹醋液稀釋液至之間。又竹醋液中添加幾丁聚醣可以顯著抑制番茄青枯病原細菌，且隨其去乙醯度及其濃度之增加，抑菌效果愈佳摘要i Abstractii 目錄iv 圖目次v 表目次vi 第一章 前言 1 第二章	炭化升溫速率對竹醋液基本性質之響 3 第三章	竹醋液之抗植物病原細菌試驗 33 第四章	竹醋液添加幾丁聚醣之抑菌協同作用 52 第五章	結論 69 第六章	參考文獻 7...|$|R
