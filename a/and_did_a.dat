His father died on April 13, 2006 from cancer. Anderson {{graduated}} from Washington High School in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. During his time there, he excelled at swimming and track and field.

5|$|Kentucky {{played a}} much-anticipated game versus Kansas on December 16, 1950, with Spivey matched up against Jayhawks center Clyde Lovellette. The Wildcats won by 29 points as Spivey outplayed Lovellette, {{in what he}} later called the best {{performance}} of his college career. After one steal, he drove to the Kansas basket <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> slam dunk; this was rare for Kentucky basketball at the time, as Rupp instructed players not to dunk during games. Spivey set another school record in a February 13, 1951, game, gathering 31rebounds. As of 2010, he remains tied for the team record with Bob Burrow, who had {{the same number of}} rebounds in a 1955 game. For the season, Spivey again averaged more than 19points per game, and he added 17.2rebounds per game. His point total led the SEC, and his 479regular season points were the third-most in league history at the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
