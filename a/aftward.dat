500|$|Evidence {{suggested}} that Cooper was shrewd. He demanded four parachutes {{to force the}} assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring {{he would not be}} deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment. He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due not only to its aft airstair, but also the high, <b>aftward</b> placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump without risk of immediate incineration by jet exhaust. It had [...] "single-point fueling" [...] capability, a recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots. In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight—a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary—and that its operation, by a single switch {{in the rear of the}} cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit. Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to [...] Central Intelligence Agency paramilitary units.|$|E
50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} a screw sleeve, which extended {{to work a}} bell crank. The bell crank turned a transverse shaft fitted with an eccentric cam, which would push or pull the pivot clamp, thus moving the rocket forward or <b>aftward</b> along its centreline.|$|E
50|$|The MISR {{instrument}} {{consists of}} an innovative configuration of nine separate digital cameras that gather data in four different spectral bands of the solar spectrum. One camera points toward the nadir, while the others provide forward and <b>aftward</b> view angles at 26.1°, 45.6°, 60.0°, and 70.5°. As the instrument flies overhead, each region of the Earth's surface is successively imaged by all nine cameras in each of four wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared).|$|E

50|$|The trailer chassis was a {{lattice frame}} of tubular members. It {{comprised}} a transverse trunnion box {{member at the}} front, from which six longitudinal tube members ran <b>aftward</b> and converged into one large main central tube at the rear; the six longitudinal members were braced vertically and horizontally by smaller-gauge tubes. The rear central tube member supported a large horizontal-plane turntable. A steerable front truck was installed just behind the trunnion box member, while the turntable surmounted a two-axle rear bogey.|$|E

50|$|Lynnland Female Institute was {{chartered}} on February 11, 1867, {{and opened}} soon <b>aftward</b> {{under the leadership}} of the local Baptist minister, Rev. G. A. Colson. In 1869, William F. Perry of Alabama (once the president of the East Alabama Female College in Tuskegee) came to serve as president of the Lynnland Female Institute. He recruited a teacher from Washington College in Virginia: the 20 year old John Peyton Hobson came to teach upon recommendation from his college president, Robert E. Lee. On June 29, 1871, Perry and Peter Eppes Harris purchased the school for $17,000 and eventually turned it co-educational as the Lynnland Military Institution (girls attended a separate department). But it closed in 1879 and Perry left for Bowling Green, Kentucky where he taught at Ogden College (a precursor to Western Kentucky University) until his death.|$|E

40|$|Flow in {{a generic}} ventral nozzle system was studied {{experimentally}} and analytically with a block {{version of the}} PARC 3 D computational fluid dynamics program (a full Navier-Stokes equation solver) in order to evaluate the program's ability to predict system performance and internal flow patterns. For the experimental work a one-third-size model tailpipe with a single large rectangular ventral nozzle mounted normal to the tailpipe axis was tested with unheated air at steady-state pressure ratios up to 4. 0. The end of the tailpipe was closed to simulate a blocked exhaust nozzle. Measurements showed about 5 1 / 2 percent flow-turning loss, reasonable nozzle performance coefficients, and a significant <b>aftward</b> axial component of thrust due to flow turning loss, reasonable nozzle performance coefficients, and a significant <b>aftward</b> axial component of thrust due to flow turning more than 90 deg. Flow behavior into and through the ventral duct is discussed and illustrated with paint streak flow visualization photographs. For the analytical work the same ventral system configuration was modeled with two computational grids to evaluate the effect of grid density. Both grids gave good results. The finer-grid solution produced more detailed flow patterns and predicted performance parameters, such as thrust and discharge coefficient, within 1 percent of the measured values. PARC 3 D flow visualization images are shown for comparison with the paint streak photographs. Modeling and computational issues encountered in the analytical work are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The MISR {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} for studying the ecology and climate of the earth through the acquisition of systematic, global multiangle imagery in reflected sunlight. MISR uses nine cameras: a nadir camera and two banks of four cameras each pointed forward and <b>aftward</b> along the spacecraft ground track to image the earth at +/- 30. 7, +/- 45. 6, +/- 60. 0, and +/- 72. 5 deg. Radiometrically calibrated images at each angle will be obtained in four spectral bands centered at 440, 550, 670, and 860 nm. MISR will take image data in two different spatial resolution modes: local mode, in which selected targets are observed with 240 -m spatial sampling, and global mode, where the entire sunlit eEarth is observed continuously with 1. 92 -km sampling. The instrument is capable of acquiring global coverage every nine days...|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} objectives, instrument concept, {{and data}} {{plan for the}} multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR), an experiment proposed for the EOS (Earth Observing System) mission, are described. MISR is a pushbroom imaging system designed to obtain continuous imagery of the sunlit Earth at four different view angles (25. 8, 45. 6, 60. 0, and 72. 5 deg relative to the vertical at the earth's surface), in both the forward and <b>aftward</b> directions relative to nadir, using eight separate cameras. Observations will be acquired in four spectral bands, centered at 440, 550, 670, and 860 nm. Data analysis algorithms will be applied to MISR imagery to retrieve the optical, geometric, and radiative properties of complex, three-dimensional scenes, such as aerosol-laden atmospheres above a heterogeneously reflecting surface, nonstratified cloud systems, and vegetation canopies. The MISR investigation will address a number of scientific questions concerning the climatic and ecological consequences of many natural and anthropogenic processes, and will furnish aerosol information necessary for atmospheric corrections of surface images...|$|E

The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26. 1, 45. 6, 60. 0, and 70. 5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.

The RCCM {{is derived from the}} radiance values, and is calculated independently for each camera. Therefore, the amount of apparent cloudiness will vary with view angle, with the oblique view angles generally being more cloudy than the near-nadir ones. Since the RCCM is calculated primarily from the radiance values, it does not work well over snow and ice and will usually confuse clear snow/ice with cloud. It works the best over clear-sky ocean, but other surface types are also of quite good quality. The RCCM product also contains a glint mask for each camera, and this mask is set to true whenever the scattering angles indicate that glint could be possible. This glint mask is not masked out over land; users must do this step themselves.

Clouds will still be displaced due to their elevation above the surface, but this time with respect to the terrain rather than the ellipsoid. (The mountain location T is now assigned the geographic location at T, and the Cloud at F appears at the geographic location T.)

The Ellipsoid product is referenced to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) ellipsoid, which approximates the Earth's shape at sea level. In this product, the radiances and associated altitudes are projected to the ellipsoid, so that higher elevation data appear displaced from their true location for non-nadir camera views, much as they are seen by the instrument. (A cloud at location F, or a mountain top at location T in the image below appears {{as if it is}} at location E.) The more oblique the camera view, or the higher in altitude the feature, the more displaced the elevated data will appear. This displacement is used to advantage in MISR stereo retrievals, and this product is the primary input to Level 2 top-of-atmosphere/cloud processing.
