Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when {{patients were}} asked if they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada and <b>pay</b> out-of-pocket <b>to</b> have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that they were unsure.

A third player observes this exchange, then can pay to punish either player. An income maximizing third parties' rational response would be to not punish, and income maximizing players would choose to defect. A 2004 study demonstrates that a near majority of participants (46%) <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to punish if one participant defects.

Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner?
