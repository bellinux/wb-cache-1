5|$|The {{baseline}} A320 {{has given}} rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318, to 220, on the A321. They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest <b>airline</b> <b>operator</b> of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.|$|E
25|$|The Administration for Industry and Commerce of Henan Province {{announced}} {{days after}} the incident that it had rescinded the enterprise name registration of Henan Airlines, and demanded that the <b>airline</b> <b>operator</b> restore its original name of Kunpeng Airlines. The administration cited as reasons for its decision that the name Henan Airlines had caused public misunderstanding and greatly damaged {{the image of the}} province, which holds no stake in the <b>airline</b> <b>operator.</b> This move was immediately met with media criticism, which questioned the validity of the administration's interference with Henan Airlines' rights to choice of name. It was also revealed that the province had offered favorable conditions to attract the <b>airline</b> <b>operator</b> to adopt its current name, and celebrated the renaming afterwards.|$|E

The decision to become Silver City's sole shareholder coincided with British Aviation Services' strategic move to become an <b>airline</b> <b>operator</b> in its own right under the Britavia name to operate trooping flights.|$|E

25|$|Although BAS Group {{had become}} the UK's biggest {{independent}} <b>airline</b> <b>operator</b> by that time, it began making heavy losses. The loss of Britavia's biggest trooping contract to Hunting-Clan was {{the main reason for}} BAS's poor financial performance. The urgent need to replace the aging flying boat fleet made this situation worse. As a result of the rapidly deteriorating financial performance of the group's flying boat activities and the lack of suitable replacements for the obsolete fleet, all flying boat activities ceased by September 1958. Both trooping and flying boat activities had accounted for a major share of the group's business.|$|E
25|$|British Aviation Services Limited (Britavia) was {{an early}} post-World War II airline holding company and air {{transport}} operator that could trace its roots back to 1946. Its main activities included trooping, inclusive tour (IT) and worldwide passenger and freight charter services. British Aviation Services' first investment in a British independent airline occurred in 1946, when it acquired a minority interest in Silver City Airways. Silver City Airways operated the world's first cross-Channel air ferry service on 13 July 1948. It subsequently became British Aviation Services' biggest operating division. In 1953, British Aviation Services took over the independent airline Air Kruise. The same year, BAS Group also took control of Aquila Airways, the last commercial flying boat operator in the United Kingdom. The completion of these acquisitions by mid-1954 resulted in a reorganisation of the British Aviation Services group, with British Aviation Services Ltd (BAS Group) becoming the group's holding company and Britavia one of its operating subsidiaries. By the late 1950s, BAS Group became Britain's largest independent <b>airline</b> <b>operator.</b> Its numerous operating divisions included Britavia's Hermes Division at Blackbushe Airport and Aquila Airways's Flying Boat Division at Hamble near Southampton. The former concentrated on trooping services and inclusive tours while the latter provided scheduled services to Portugal, the Canary Islands and Italy. In 1962, BAS Group merged with British United Airways (BUA), which by that time had replaced BAS as the UK's largest independent <b>airline</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E
500|$|Flying {{schools are}} {{commercial}} businesses {{engaged in the}} training of pilots, both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally. They make widespread use of fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights. School-owned aircraft account for {{a significant amount of}} GA activity, both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements. The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry. It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60–70 per cent of professional pilots have self-financed their flight training at GA schools, and one UK <b>airline</b> <b>operator</b> has stated that the industry must rely on 70–80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector. The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent. The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK, and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots. The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give [...] "some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened", but that the data on flying hours [...] "does not support such a gloomy outlook." [...] Of course, reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the UK foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{years since}} {{bankruptcy}} were initially marked by mixed results for UAL. The company turned a profit in 2007, yet the fuel {{crisis in the}} summer 2008, where NYMEX Light Sweet Crude reached almost $150 a barrel, pushed the company into losses. To try {{to put an end}} to UAL's decades of boom and bust cycles, CEO Tilton pushed for a merger with another major US carrier. Tilton stated that he believed that having larger market-share and a more diverse route network were the way for UAL to reach sustainable profitability, though many, including UAL's [...] unions groups, strongly disagreed. In early 2008 UAL Corporation held merger talks with American <b>airline</b> <b>operator</b> Continental Airlines, Inc. However, the deal was called off after problems in the credit markets, as well as weak support from labor groups, made an official merger impossible. UAL's United instead decided to form an alliance with Continental.|$|E
