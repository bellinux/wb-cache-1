40|$|Five {{cases of}} vesicovaginal fistula have been r e ported, cause {{of which were}} tuberculosis, {{radiation}} effect and recurrence of cancer after the surgical procedure for carcinoma of <b>uterus,</b> <b>artificial</b> delivering and abortus. All of them were treated by divertion of urinary tract, since it was considered that the closure of fistula alone was unsuccessful and inadequate for these cases. Aetiology, incidence a n d surgical treatment of this disease have been discussed in. this paper. Although ureterosigmoidostomy has been thought in generally to be dangerous because of high mortality due to hyperchloremic acidosis, this procedure, however, was dare chosen in our cases from the reason that ureterocutaneostomy was not convenient for the patient. Two of five cases have had almost satisfactory postoperative course, enjoying their lives without trouble so far. It seems that these facts shows th e ureterosigmoidostomy should not be completely abandoned as a surgical operation for diversion of urinary tract, and our efforts could be continued towards to an improvement of this method itself...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi estudar o efeito do nível de ingestão de matéria seca (IMS/% do PV) sobre ganho de peso, produção e viabilidade de embriões em novilhas mestiças e vacas Nelore. No primeiro experimento foram utilizadas 27 novilhas cruzadas (½ Nelore x ½ Simental) distribuídas em três tratamentos e nove repetições: 1, 2; 1, 6 e 2, 6 % de IMS/dia em relação ao peso vivo, respectivamente. Os animais foram submetidas à superovulação com FSH e a coleta dos embriões realizada sete dias após a inseminação artificial, através de lavagem uterina. Este procedimento foi repetido por mais duas vezes com intervalos de 45 dias. No segundo experimento foram usadas 21 vacas Nelore de três anos, distribuídas em três tratamentos: 1, 0; 1, 8 e 2, 6 % de IMS em relação ao peso vivo. Após 30 dias os animais foram sincronizados com implante {{auricular}} de norgestomet e superovulados com FSH, sendo a coleta dos embriões realizada sete dias após a inseminação artificial, através de lavagem uterina. O peso vivo final, ganho médio diário e peso de carcaça foram maiores para os animais alimentados com 2, 6 % de IMS. O nível de IMS e o período de coleta não tiveram influência sobre o número de corpos lúteos, número de estruturas totais transferíveis e degeneradas e ovócitos, tanto para novilhas como para vacas. This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of dry matter feed intake level (DMI/% BW), weight gain, production and viability of embryos in cross-breed heifers so does production and viability of embryonic structures in Nellore cows. During the first trial, 27 cross-breed (½ Nelore x ½ Simental) heifers were used divided in 3 treatments and 9 replications: 1. 2 %; 1. 6 % and 2. 6 % of DMI/day in relation to body weight, respectively. The heifers were synchronized and after nine days these animals were superovulated using FSH. The embryos were collected seven days after the <b>artificial</b> insemination by <b>uterus</b> flushing. This procedure was repeated twice with intervals of 45 days. In the second trial, 21 Nellore cows of 3 years old were used. The cows were divided in 3 treatments: 1. 0; 1. 8 and 2. 6 % of DMI according to body weight. After 30 days, the cows were synchronized with norgestomet implant and superovulated with FSH. The embryos were collected seven days after <b>artificial</b> insemination by <b>uterus</b> flushing. The final body weight, average daily gain and carcass weight were superior for cows fed 2. 6 % of DMI. On the other hand, the DMI levels and collect period did not influence on corpus luteum number nor on total, transferable and degenerated numbers of structures and not fertilized oocites for heifers and the cows...|$|R

50|$|Ectogenesis {{of human}} embryos and fetuses {{would require an}} <b>artificial</b> <b>uterus.</b> An <b>artificial</b> <b>uterus</b> {{would have to be}} {{supplied}} by nutrients and oxygen from some source to nurture a fetus, as well as dispose of waste material. There would likely be a need for an interface between such a supplier, filling this function of the placenta. An <b>artificial</b> <b>uterus,</b> as a replacement organ, could be used to assist women with damaged, diseased or removed uteri to avail the fetus to be conceived to term. It also has the potential to move the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. This would have implications for the ongoing controversy regarding human reproductive rights.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>artificial</b> <b>uterus,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as an 'exowomb', would have to provide nutrients and oxygen to nurture a fetus, as well as dispose of waste material.

50|$|An <b>artificial</b> <b>uterus,</b> as a {{replacement}} organ, would have many applications. It {{could be used to}} assist male or female couples {{in the development of a}} fetus. This can potentially be performed as a switch from a natural uterus to an <b>artificial</b> <b>uterus,</b> thereby moving the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. In this sense, it can be regarded as a neonatal incubator with very extended functions. Also, it can potentially be used for initiation of fetal development. Furthermore, it could avail for performing, for example, fetal surgery procedures at an early stage instead of having to postpone them until term of pregnancy.|$|E

50|$|Artificial uteri may {{expand the}} range of fetal viability, raising {{questions}} about the role that fetal viability plays within abortion law.
