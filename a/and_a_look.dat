500|$|In the 1993–1994 NBA season, Rodman {{joined a}} Spurs team {{which was built}} around {{perennial}} All-Star center David Robinson, with a supporting cast of forwards Dale Ellis, Willie Anderson and guard Vinny Del Negro. On the hardwood, Rodman now was played as a power forward and won his third straight rebounding title, averaging 17.3boards per game, along with another All-Defensive Team call-up. Living up to his promise of killing the [...] "shy imposter" [...] and [...] "being himself" [...] instead, Rodman began to show first signs of unconventional behavior: before the first game, he shaved his hair and dyed it blonde, which was followed up by stints with red, purple, blue hair <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> inspired from the film Demolition Man. During the season, he headbutted Stacey King and John Stockton, refused to leave the hardwood once after being ejected, and had a highly publicized two-month affair with Madonna. The only player to whom Rodman related was reserve center Jack Haley, who earned his trust by not being shocked after {{a visit to a}} gay bar. However, despite a 55-win season, Rodman and the Spurs did not survive {{the first round of the}} 1994 NBA Playoffs and bowed out against the Utah Jazz in four games.|$|E
