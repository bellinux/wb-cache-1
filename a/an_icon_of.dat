5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have drawn}} much {{attention}} to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as flagship species, the most notable {{of which is the}} ring-tailed lemur, which is considered <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> the country. The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive ecotourism, which especially helps local communities living {{in the vicinity of the}} national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other species}} of Pokémon, Pikachu are often {{captured}} and groomed by humans to fight other Pokémon for sport. Pikachu {{are one of the}} most well-known varieties of Pokémon, largely because a Pikachu is a central character in the Pokémon anime series. Pikachu is regarded as a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Japanese pop culture in recent years. It is also seen as one of the major mascots for Nintendo.|$|E

To the west of the gorge is Leigh Woods, the name of both a village and the National Trust forest it is {{situated}} in.

5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not obligatory, so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles in}} this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan {{widespread}} adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to author Anupama Chopra, established him as <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> romance in India. He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.|$|E

5|$|According to the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Jordan is home {{to around}} 100,000 archaeological and tourist sites. Some very well {{preserved}} historical cities include Petra and Jerash, the former being Jordan's most popular tourist attraction and <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom. Jordan {{is part of the}} Holy Land and has several biblical attractions that attract pilgrimage activities. Biblical sites include: Al-Maghtas—a traditional location for the Baptism of Jesus, Mount Nebo, Umm ar-Rasas, Madaba and Machaerus. Islamic sites include shrines of the prophet Muhammad's companions such as 'Abd Allah ibn Rawahah, Zayd ibn Harithah and Muadh ibn Jabal. Ajlun Castle built by Muslim Ayyubid leader Saladin in the 12th century AD during his wars with the Crusaders, is also a popular tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Saints Marina and Jovan Vladimir, dated 1711, {{is part of}} the iconostasis of the Monastery of StNaum near Ohrid {{in western}} Macedonia. The icon's {{position}} on the iconostasis indicates that Vladimir was an important figure of local veneration. He was often depicted in the company of Saints Clement and Naum in Macedonian churches. A number of 18th-century painters from central and southern Albania painted the saint in churches of the region, especially in the area of Moscopole. A portable icon of the saint was created in 1739 at the Ardenica Monastery in southwestern Albania. It depicts him seated on a throne, surrounded by twelve panels showing scenes of his life and miracles. Saint Jovan Vladimir is represented on frescos in three monasteries of Mount Athos: Hilandar, Zograf, and Philotheou; and three Bulgarian monasteries: Rila, Troyan, and Lozen.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened {{to the outside world}} in the 1970s, it became <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcome of}} the war was a {{complete}} Byzantine victory, and Tzimiskes decided to take full advantage. Although he initially recognized Boris II as the legitimate Bulgarian tsar, after the fall of Dorostolon his intentions changed. This became evident during his triumphal return to Constantinople, where the emperor entered the Golden Gate behind a wagon carrying <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin Mary as well as the Bulgarian regalia, with Boris and his family following behind Tzimiskes. When the procession reached the Forum of Constantine, Boris was publicly divested of his imperial insignia, and at the church of Hagia Sophia, the Bulgarian crown was dedicated to God.|$|E
5|$|The {{repulsion}} of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea {{was an important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival {{as a sign of}} divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned in the account of Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E
5|$|When the Civil War began, Tubman {{worked for}} the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed {{expedition}} in the war, she guided the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 slaves. After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She {{was active in the}} women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her and she had to be admitted to a home for elderly African Americans that she had helped to establish years earlier. After she died in 1913, she became <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> American courage and freedom.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} about 30 people and was the first game at Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine, although team veterans preferred to have used 2D graphics instead. At first, director Hifumi Kono was not interested in working on a sequel to the first Clock Tower, but after seeing the technical possibilities with newly released hardware of the time, he agreed. For Kono, {{one of the most difficult}} parts of developing Clock Tower was choosing the platform. At the time, the PlayStation and Sega Saturn were already on the market. The Saturn was seen as <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> next-generation gaming with games like Virtua Fighter (1994). The PlayStation was new to the industry, and despite having a preliminary lead in popularity over the Saturn, its future was uncertain. Meanwhile, the Nintendo 64 was scheduled to arrive on the market soon, coming off the success of the Super Nintendo. Kono eventually settled on the PlayStation, and in retrospect considers it the best choice he could have made since the console's future success helped Clock Tower sell better than expected.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{his wife}} had moved to Somerset. In 1940, {{she gave birth to}} a son, Euan, who had many medical problems, and in 1943 she bore a third daughter, Iona. The {{pressure}} of running the household and caring for Euan led Isla to have a nervous breakdown after Iona's birth. When Jardine returned from the war, the family moved to Radlett to be closer to London. Isla recovered and Jardine found a job with paper manufacturers Wiggins Teape. In 1946, Jardine was chosen to play for Old England in a popular and successful fund raising match against Surrey. He displayed much of his old batting skill but did not show much involvement with his team-mates. By 1948, Jardine was more accepted in the cricket world. This was partly due to English perception of the short-pitched fast bowling of Australian pairing Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller as being hostile. England's poor performance in the 1946–47 and 1948 Ashes also caused writers to remember Jardine more fondly as <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> past English success.|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is one of}} {{the four}} most devotionally revered Tirthankaras, along with Mahavira, Parshvanatha and Neminatha. Various Jain temple {{complexes}} across India feature him, and these are important pilgrimage sites in Jainism. Mount Shatrunjaya, for example, is a hilly part of southern Gujarat, which {{is believed to have been}} a place where 23 out of 24 Tirthankaras preached, along with Rishabha. Numerous monks are believed to have attained their liberation from cycles of rebirth there, and a large temple within the complex is dedicated to Rishabha commemorating his enlightenment in Ayodhya. The central Rishabha icon of this complex is called Adinatha or simply Dada (grandfather). This icon is the most revered of all the murtipujaka icons, believed by some in the Jain tradition to have miracle making powers, according to John Cort. In Jain texts, Kunti and the five Pandava brothers of the Hindu Epic Mahabharata came to the hill top to pay respects, and consecrated <b>an</b> <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Rishabha at Shatrunjaya.|$|E
