5|$|Unboxing is the {{operation}} of converting <b>a</b> <b>value</b> of a reference type (previously boxed) into <b>a</b> <b>value</b> of <b>a</b> <b>value</b> type. Unboxing in C# requires an explicit type cast. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).|$|E

5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving <b>a</b> <b>value</b> of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives <b>a</b> <b>value</b> of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E
