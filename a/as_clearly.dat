5|$|Asteroids in the {{asteroid}} belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. The asteroid belt also contains main-belt comets, {{which may have been}} the source of Earth's water.|$|E
5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the room <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E

For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.|$|E

25|$|The {{calcification}} deposits, {{after they}} have become sufficiently advanced, are partially visible on coronary artery computed tomography or electron beam tomography (EBT) as rings of increased radiographic density, forming halos around the outer edges of the atheromatous plaques, within the artery wall. On CT, >130 units on the Hounsfield scale (some argue for 90 units) has been the radiographic density usually accepted <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> representing tissue calcification within arteries. These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.|$|E
25|$|Using {{satellite}} imagery {{in combination with}} GIS and on-the-ground studies, {{it is possible to}} generate maps of likely occurrences of future landslides. Such maps should show the locations of previous events as well <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> indicate the probable locations of future events. In general, to predict landslides, one must assume that their occurrence is determined by certain geologic factors, and that future landslides will occur under the same conditions as past events. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a relationship between the geomorphologic conditions in which the past events took place and the expected future conditions.|$|E
25|$|By the 13th {{century the}} {{universities}} of Oxford and Paris had come up, and the scholars were now studying mathematics and philosophy with lesser worries about mundane chores of life—the fields were not <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> demarcated {{as they are}} in the modern times. Of these, compendia and redactions, such as those of Johannes Campanus, of Euclid and Aristotle, confronted scholars with ideas about infinity and the ratio theory of elements as a means of expressing relations between various quantities involved with moving bodies. These studies led to a new body of knowledge that is now known as physics.|$|E

25|$|Another fishing reel was {{featured}} in a painting by Wu Zhen (12801354). The book Tianzhu lingqian (Holy Lections from Indian Sources), printed sometime between 1208 and 1224, features two different woodblock print illustrations of fishing reels being used. An Armenian parchment Gospel of the 13th century shows a reel (though not <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> depicted as the Chinese ones). The Sancai Tuhui, a Chinese encyclopedia published in 1609, features the next known picture of a fishing reel and vividly shows the windlass pulley of the device. These five pictures mentioned {{are the only ones}} which feature fishing reels before the year 1651.|$|E
25|$|But {{the alleged}} {{right to a}} new trial is not a {{sufficient}} guarantee for the defendant, <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> ruled the ECtHR {{in the case of}} Krombach v. France, application no. 29731/96, and also article 6 of ECHR, the juridical ground of Battisti's claim against extradition, doesn't prescribe a new trial. ECHR establishes that there is not an absolute right to a new trial, after a trial in absentia. Battisti's claim concerned the defendant's knowledge of the trial, and Battisti's lawyers argued that the defendant had not been in a position to know that in Italy there was a trial against him and so his rights had been violated.|$|E

While face to face sexual scripts for individuals of what is acceptable have been readily available, with the creation of the Internet, the rules of what constitutes infidelity are not <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> established anymore. Yarab, Sensibaugh, & Allgeier (1998) found that couples often expect both sexual and mental exclusivity in their monogamous relationships, suggesting a need for more research in this particular area of infidelity.|$|E

25|$|On February 18, 1935, the Justices' {{decisions}} {{in all three}} cases were announced; all supported the government's position by a narrow 5–4 majority. Chief Justice Hughes wrote the opinion for each case, finding the government had plenary power to regulate money. As such, the abrogation of {{both private and public}} contractual gold clauses was within congressional reach when such clauses represented a threat to Congress's control of the monetary system. Speaking for the Court in the Perry case, Hughes's opinion was remarkable: in a judicial tongue-lashing not seen since Marbury v. Madison, Hughes chided Congress for an act which, while legal, was regarded <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> immoral. However, Hughes ultimately found the plaintiff had no cause of action, and thus no standing to sue the government.|$|E
25|$|Information can {{be drawn}} as to the tunnel's vertex which lies at 1154,5meters above sea level {{and the fact that}} the tunnel does not run in a {{straight}} line but rather in a slope down from either side of its vertex. The tunnel was designed in such a way that inflowing water would be able to drain. From the railway station of Göschenen to the tunnel's vertex the train lines ascend at an angle of 6‰ and descend at 2‰ from vertex to the village of Airolo. The tunnel's length is indicated to be 14'998meters, its vertex being at kilometre80. It must be noted that the old Gotthard railways' distances were measured from the town of Immensee, <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> indicated on the graphic timetable.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} {{on whether}} an uprising is an insurgency or a belligerency {{has not been}} <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> codified as many other areas covered by the internationally accepted laws of war for two reasons. The first is that international law traditionally does not encroach on matters that are solely {{the internal affairs of}} a sovereign state, but recent developments such as the responsibility to protect, are starting to undermine the traditional approach. The second is that at the Hague Conference of 1899, there was disagreement between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture, and smaller states, which maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants. The dispute resulted in a compromise wording being included in the Hague Conventions known as the Martens Clause from the diplomat who drafted the clause.|$|E

25|$|The lyra {{depicted}} on the Byzantine ivory casket of Museo Nazionale, Florence (900 – 1100 AD) has two strings and pear-shaped body with long and narrow neck. The soundboard is depicted without soundholes {{and as a}} distinct and attached piece, however this {{might be due to}} stylistic abstraction. The lyras of Novgorod (1190 AD) are closer morphologically to the present bowed lyras (see gallery): they were pear-shaped and 40cm long; they had semi-circular soundholes and provision for three strings. The middle string served as a drone while fingering the others by finger or fingernail alone, downwards or sidewards against the string, for there was no fingerboard to press them against: a method which gives the notes <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> as the violin and remains normal in lyras both in Asia as well as on present bowed instruments in post-Byzantine regions such as the Cretan lyra.|$|E
25|$|Decollectivization {{increased}} the {{options available to}} individual households and made household heads increasingly responsible for the economic success of their households. In 1987, for example, it was legally possible to leave the village and move into a nearby town {{to work in a}} small factory, open a noodle stand, or set up a machine repair business. Farmers, however, still could not legally move into medium-sized or large cities. The Chinese press reported an increased appreciation in the countryside for education and an increased desire for agriculturally oriented newspapers and journals, as well <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> written manuals on such profitable trades as rabbit-raising and beekeeping. As specialization and division of labor increased, along with increasingly visible differences in income and living standards, it became more difficult to encompass most of the rural population in a few large categories. During the early 1980s, the pace of economic and social change in rural China was rapid, and the people caught up in the change had difficulty making sense of the process.|$|E
25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction <b>as</b> <b>clearly</b> as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
