500|$|Altogether, Meessen's {{photographic}} {{ventures in}} the Indies {{and the resulting}} albums cost some 34,000Netherlands Indies gulden, which included camera equipment (though {{it is not known}} what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his albumen prints. In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote, [...] "made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: [...] "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted. Once I told them, they promised their assistance. At exactly 5a.m. the following morning I found some 60warriors waiting for me on the beach." ...|$|E

He later said [...] "When the interviewer, Pat Paulsen, got to me, he <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought the critics would say about Candy. I said I didn't think it would be reviewed by the regular critics, {{that they would have to}} reconvene the Nuremberg Trials to do it justice. He laughed and <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had liked, and I said I liked the lady who showed me the nearest exit so that I would not be forced to vomit indoors." ...|$|E

He stated during his You Can't Fix Stupid show, [...] "Somebody <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was drinking. If the company that made the stuff I was drinking was paying me, I'd have it in their bottle and not mine. But it's the kind of scotch that people drink that are going to die penniless. It's good though!" [...] In 2009 Comedy Central released Ron's stand up DVD Behavioral Problems.|$|E
2500|$|Venice {{had changed}} for him. Casanova now had little money for gambling, few willing females worth pursuing, and few acquaintances to enliven his dull days. He {{heard of the}} death of his mother and, more paining, visited the deathbed of Bettina Gozzi, who had first {{introduced}} him to sex and who died in his arms. His Iliad was published in three volumes, but to limited subscribers and yielding little money. He got into a published dispute with Voltaire over religion. When he asked, [...] "Suppose that you succeed in destroying superstition. With what will you replace it?" [...] Voltaire shot back, [...] "I like that. When I deliver humanity from a ferocious beast which devours it, can I be <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> shall put in its place." [...] From Casanova's point of view, if Voltaire had [...] "been a proper philosopher, he would have kept silent on that subject ... the people need to live in ignorance for the general peace of the nation".|$|E

2500|$|One official, Back Judge Adrian Burk, {{signaled}} that {{the play was}} a touchdown, but the other game officials did not immediately make any signal. When the officials huddled, Burk and another official, Umpire Pat Harder, thought that the play was a touchdown because Tatum and Fuqua had both touched the ball, while three others {{said that they were}} {{not in a position to}} rule. Referee Fred Swearingen approached Steelers sideline official Jim Boston and asked to be taken to a telephone. Boston took Swearingen to a baseball dugout in the stadium. There was a video monitor in the dugout, but it was not used by Swearingen. (Terry Bradshaw's assertion that a special television was rigged up on the sideline so that Swearingen could watch the replay is not supported by other accounts.) From the dugout telephone Boston put in a call to the press box to reach the NFL's supervisor of officials, Art McNally. Before the call McNally had [...] "an opinion from the get-go" [...] that the ball had hit Tatum's chest, which he confirmed by looking [...] "at one shot on instant replay." [...] In the press box the telephone was answered either by Dan Rooney, son of Steelers owner Art Rooney, or by Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon (reports vary), and McNally was put on the line. According to McNally, Swearingen [...] "never asked me about the rule, and never <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw. All he said was, 'Two of my men say that opposing players touched the ball.' And I said, 'everything's fine then, go ahead.'" [...] After Swearingen hung up the phone Boston asked, [...] "What do we got?" [...] "We got a touchdown," [...] answered Swearingen, who then went back onto the field to signal the ruling to the crowd. Franco Harris crossed the goal line at approximately 3:29 PM EST. Fans immediately rushed the field, and it took 15 minutes to clear them so that the extra point could be kicked to give the Steelers what turned out to be their final margin of victory, 13–7.|$|E
