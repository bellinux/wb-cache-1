Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of {{his foot on the}} wolf's lower jaw and his hand on the wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, as a {{graduate}} student at Chicago, he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as <b>a</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E

5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with <b>a</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{that this man}} is the actual, corporeal Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake are familiar with is merely a dream.

At that instant, the Lich springs into action, physically waking and destroying Prismo, killing him. Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase.|$|E
5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the Harivamsa.

Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in Harivamsa, but is a symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E

They were paid a stipend similar to that of a postdoctoral researcher, which enabled them to support families during their graduate studies.

5|$|More than 800,000 Varkaris {{travel to}} Pandharpur for the yatra on Shayani Ekadashi, the 11th {{day of the}} waxing moon in the lunar month of Ashadha. Both Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodhini Ekadashi (in the waxing half of Kartik), are {{associated}} with the mythology of Vishnu. Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in Ksheersagar (<b>a</b> <b>cosmic</b> ocean of milk), while lying on the back of Shesha-nāga (the cosmic serpent). His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi (literally the 'sleeping 11th') and he finally awakens from his slumber, four months later, on Prabodhini Ekadashi. The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full-moon in those months, concluding with torchlight processions. Inscriptions dating to the 11thcentury mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur. On Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi, the chief minister or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra. This form of worship is known as sarkari-mahapuja.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and <b>a</b> <b>cosmic</b> distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused <b>a</b> <b>cosmic</b> inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E
5|$|But the {{identification}} of the poem as Stoic is not unanimous. In 1887, against the common opinion of scholars at the time, Gustave Lanson contested the idea that the poem is Stoic. More recently, in 2005, Alexander MacGregor argued that while contemporary scholars, such as Goold and Volk, read Manilius as a Stoic, the Astronomica actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places. Namely, Manilius exalts Plato, Socrates, and Pythagoras; proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God, denies the ekpyrosis (that is, a belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every Great Year, followed by <b>a</b> <b>cosmic</b> recreation), never discusses the six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero, and ignores the importance of controlling the soul. Manilius also focuses on a number of decidedly Pythagorean tenets: the Pythagorean order of the planets, the importance of geometry and numbers, and the significance of tetraktys (that is, triangular figures made up of ten points arranged in four rows). Finally, in key places, the poet makes use of non-Stoics like Eudoxus of Cnidus and Cicero. Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an idealistic Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic.|$|E
