The author discusses Morrison's early life in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and how this influenced his perspective of [...] "no surrender", a reference to Ulster Unionism. Rogan writes how, a young boy, Morrison exhibited [...] "poor communication skills, aggressive impatience, and absence of empathy", and yearned for positive relations between his Protestant and Catholic friends. The author notes that a theme of Morrison's youth was his appreciation of music and his pleasure of creating music influenced by gospel and love. He cites Morrison's cousin Jackie Stitt who said: [...] "He {{could have been a}} good sportsman but he had no interest in it at all. He'd play <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> for a while until he got bored – he seemed to tire of it quickly. He'd go indoors." ...|$|E
