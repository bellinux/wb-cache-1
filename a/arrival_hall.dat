Construction of the new facility began in December 2014. Named Jewel Changi Airport, the complex will offer aviation and travel-related facilities, a wide range of retail offerings, as well as unique leisure attractions. The redevelopment will also expect Terminal 1 to be expanded to allow more space for the <b>arrival</b> <b>hall,</b> baggage claim areas and taxi bays, enabling T1's passenger handling capacity to increase to 24 million passenger movements per annum. Changi will be working with CapitaMalls Asia on the concept and plans of Jewel Changi Airport. The completion of the complex would expect a joint venture partnership between Changi and CapitaMalls Asia to develop and manage Project Jewel. Jewel Changi Airport is also being designed {{with a view of the}} complex from both the Airport Boulevard and the sky. It will be designed by a consortium of design consultants led by architect Moshe Safdie, who designed Marina Bay Sands. A feature of the complex will be a large-scale indoor garden with a waterfall. To be connected to Terminals 1, 2 and 3, Project Jewel will serve as a node linking the three terminals, improving inter-terminal connectivity.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>arrivals</b> <b>hall</b> {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1974, {{with the same}} technology as the previous airport. The luggage claim was very small and could only fit 40 people at most. It was expanded in the 1980s, they added seats and modernized the Conveyor belt which made luggage transportation easier. In the 1990s, the room was widened and more seats were added along with a fan to cool the passengers down. This expansion also allowed more people to fit in the building. In the late 1990s, when cargo airlines first started operations there, the airport needed a new cargo terminal. So {{an expansion of the}} <b>arrivals</b> <b>hall</b> was made to build a very small and simple cargo terminal. This cargo terminal would later be replaced by a newer and more advanced cargo terminal in 2014. The final addition to the <b>arrivals</b> <b>hall</b> was a new TV screen that could show the arrivals and landings. It was installed in the early 2000s. In 2014, the old cargo terminal closed down and it was now vacant. In late 2016, the expansion was complete. In this new building, a new <b>arrivals</b> <b>hall</b> was built. This replaced the previous <b>arrivals</b> <b>hall</b> and leaving it vacant. It is planned in late 2017, the building with be demolished and replaced with a parking lot.|$|R
