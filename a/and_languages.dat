5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races <b>and</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture <b>and</b> <b>languages</b> and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E

40|$|Speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> {{difficulties}} {{are a common}} reason for referral to child health services during the preschool years. A speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> problem {{in the early years}} may have significant implications for one‘s communication outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. However, there is considerable variation in what constitutes normal speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> acquisition. Many preschool children who are late to talk improve spontaneously, while some apparently typical young children may decline in their speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> performance in later years. The predictive power of an individual‘s speechlanguage ability for their later speech-language status improves with age. Speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> problems at school-entry appear to be a stronger predicator for later communication issues than speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> problems in the preschool years. With the potential long-term impact of speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> problems, screening procedures for speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> problems in school-age children have been developed. This chapter addresses some of the difficulties in implementing population-wide screening for speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> problems in the early years and reviews some commonly used assessment tools for identifying school children with suspected speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> problems. Procedures for conducting language screening that are both beneficial to school-age children and cost-effective for society are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Some poetry {{types are}} {{specific}} to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may {{think of it as}} written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures <b>and</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|E

40|$|Communication lets us {{interact}} with the narrow and wider environment. Speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> must be properly developed {{if we want to}} communicate successfully. When there are some derogations in speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> development, parents seek for a speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> pathologist. Before parents seek help, they must evaluate children’s difficulties as necessary for speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> pathologist intervention. The reason for the conduction of this research was to determine when and for which difficulty parents will seek help from a speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> pathologist. The goal was to find out the level of awareness in parents concerning speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> development. The empirical part focuses on parents and their evaluation for speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> pathologist for specific difficulty at a certain age of a child. The interest lay in the type of problem for which parents seek help from a speech pathologist and when they do it. Moreover, the focus was also on the question if there are any differences between parents, when they seek for help. The level of education of parents, the number of children, speech <b>and</b> <b>language</b> pathologist’s visits <b>and</b> occupation were compared. The interest also lay in the question whether parents react more appropriately in the understanding and articulation section than in the phonological awareness and grammar capability section. For this thesis, an author questionnaire which consists of eight sections was made. These sections are early communication, oral motor, articulation, hearing detection, understanding, phonological awareness, grammar capability <b>and</b> <b>language</b> capability.
