As in Mellish's approach, lowerbounds (examples) {{as well as}} upperbounds can be handled. Instead of storing the complete S- and G-sets, only one element s {{is an element of}} S and g is an element of G is stored, together with backtrack information. The worst-case space complexity of our algorithm is linear in the number of lower- <b>and</b> <b>upperbounds.</b> For the Candidate Elimination algorithm this can be exponential.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{specification}} language of temporal logic, the corresponding verification framework, {{and the underlying}} computational model to deal with real-time properties of concurrent and reactive systems. A global, discrete, and asynchronous clock is incorporated into the model by defining the abstract notion of a real-time transition system as a conservative extension of traditional transition systems: qualitative fairness requirements are replaced (and superseded) by quantitative lower-bound <b>and</b> <b>upperbound</b> real-time requirements for transitions. We show how to model real-time systems that communicate either through shared variables or by message passing, and how to represent the important real-time constructs of priorities (interrupts), scheduling, and timeouts in this framework. Two styles for the specification of real-time properties are presented. The first style uses bounded versions of the temporal operators; the real-time requirements expressed in this style are classified [...] ...|$|R

In timed transition systems, the qualitative fairness requirements of traditional transition system are replaced (and superseded) by quantitative lower-bound <b>and</b> <b>upperbound</b> timing constraints on transitions. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to explore the scope of applicability for the abstract model of timed transition systems. We demonstrate that the model can represent a wide variety of phenomena that routinely occur in conjunction with the timed execution of concurrent processes. Our treatment covers both processes that are executed in parallel on separate processors and communicate either through shared variables or by message passing, and processes that time-share a limited number of processors under a given scheduling policy. Often it is this scheduling policy that determines if a system meets its real-time requirements. Thus we explicitly address such questions as time-outs, interrupts, static and dynamic priorities.
