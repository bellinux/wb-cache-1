Awake [...] My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, [...] Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight, [...] Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field [...] 20 [...] Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring [...] Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, [...] What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed, [...] How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee [...] Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. [...] Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye [...] On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. [...] O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, [...] My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see [...] Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night, [...] 30 [...] Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd, [...] If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee, [...] Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe, [...] But of offence and trouble, which my mind [...] Knew never till this irksom night; methought [...] Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk [...] With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, [...] Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time, [...] The cool, the silent, save where silence yields [...] To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake [...] 40 [...] Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes [...] Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light [...] Shadowie sets {{off the face of}} things; in vain, [...] If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes, [...] Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, [...] In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment [...] Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. [...] I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; [...] To find thee I directed then my walk; [...] And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways [...] 50 [...] That brought me on a sudden to the Tree [...] Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd, [...] Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: [...] And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood [...] One shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'n [...] By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd [...] Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd; [...] And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, [...] Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, [...] Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd? [...] 60 [...] Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? [...] Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold [...] Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? [...] This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme [...] He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd [...] At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: [...] But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine, [...] Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, [...] Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit [...] For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: [...] 70 [...] And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more [...] Communicated, more abundant growes, [...] The Author not impair'd, but honourd more?

[...] Best Image of my self and dearer half, [...] The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep [...] Affects me equally; nor can I like [...] This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; [...] Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, [...] Created pure. But know that in the Soule [...] 100 [...] Are many lesser Faculties that serve [...] Reason as chief; among these Fansie next [...] Her office holds; of all external things, [...] Which the five watchful Senses represent, [...] She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, [...] Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames [...] All what we affirm or what deny, and call [...] Our knowledge or opinion; then retires [...] Into her private Cell when Nature rests.

[...] These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, [...] Almightie, thine this universal Frame, [...] Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! [...] Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens [...] To us invisible or dimly seen [...] In these thy lowest works, yet these declare [...] Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: [...] Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, [...] 160 [...] Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs [...] And choral symphonies, Day without Night, [...] Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n, [...] On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll [...] Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. [...] Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, [...] If better thou belong not to the dawn, [...] Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn [...] With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare [...] While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. [...] 170 [...] Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, [...] Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise [...] In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, [...] And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst. [...] Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st [...] With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, [...] And yee five other wandring Fires that move [...] In mystic Dance not without Song, resound [...] His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light. [...] Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth [...] 180 [...] Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run [...] Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix [...] And nourish all things, let your ceasless change [...] Varie to our great Maker still new praise. [...] Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise [...] From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, [...] Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, [...] In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, [...] Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, [...] Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, [...] 190 [...] Rising or falling still advance his praise. [...] His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, [...] Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, [...] With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. [...] Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, [...] Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. [...] Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, [...] That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, [...] Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise; [...] Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk [...] 200 [...] The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; [...] Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, [...] To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade [...] Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise. [...] Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still [...] To give us onely good; and if the night [...] Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, [...] Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. [...] So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts [...] Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm. [...] 210 [...] On to thir mornings rural work they haste [...] Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row [...] Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr [...] Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check [...] Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine [...] To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines [...] Her mariageable arms, and with her brings [...] Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn [...] His barren leaves.

[...] Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth [...] Satan from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf [...] Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd [...] This night the human pair, how he designes [...] In them at once to ruin all mankind. [...] Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend [...] Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade [...] 230 [...] Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd, [...] To respit his day-labour with repast, [...] Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, [...] As may advise him of his happie state, [...] Happiness in his power left free to will, [...] Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, [...] Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware [...] He swerve not too secure: tell him withall [...] His danger, and from whom, what enemie [...] Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now [...] 240 [...] The fall of others from like state of bliss; [...] By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, [...] But by deceit and lies; this let him know, [...] Least wilfully transgressing he pretend [...] Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. [...] So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld [...] All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint [...] After his charge receivd, but from among [...] Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood [...] Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light [...] 250 [...] Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires [...] On each hand parting, to his speed gave way [...] Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate [...] Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide [...] On golden Hinges turning, as by work [...] Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd. [...] From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, [...] Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, [...] Not unconform to other shining Globes, [...] Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd [...] 260 [...] Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass [...] Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes [...] Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: [...] Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades [...] Delos or Samos first appeering kenns [...] A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight [...] He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie [...] Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing [...] Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann [...] Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare [...] 270 [...] Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems [...] A Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird [...] When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's [...] Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies. [...] At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise [...] He lights, and to his proper shape returns [...] A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade [...] His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad [...] Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest [...] With regal Ornament; the middle pair [...] 280 [...] Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round [...] Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold [...] And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet [...] Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile [...] Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, [...] And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld [...] The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands [...] Of Angels under watch; and to his state, [...] And to his message high in honour rise; [...] For on som message high they guessd him bound. [...] 290 [...] Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come [...] Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, [...] And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; [...] A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here [...] Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will [...] Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, [...] Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. [...] Him through the spicie Forrest onward com [...] Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat [...] Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun [...] 300 [...] Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme [...] Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; [...] And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd [...] For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please [...] True appetite, and not disrelish thirst [...] Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, [...] Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. [...] Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold [...] Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape [...] Comes this way moving; seems another Morn [...] 310 [...] Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n [...] To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe [...] This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, [...] And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure [...] Abundance, fit to honour and receive [...] Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford [...] Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow [...] From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies [...] Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows [...] More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. [...] 320 [...] To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, [...] Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, [...] All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; [...] Save what by frugal storing firmness gains [...] To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: [...] But I will haste and from each bough and break, [...] Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice [...] To entertain our Angel guest, as hee [...] Beholding shall confess that here on Earth [...] God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. [...] 330 [...] So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste [...] She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent [...] What choice to chuse for delicacie best, [...] What order, so contriv'd as not to mix [...] Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring [...] Taste <b>after</b> <b>taste</b> upheld with kindliest change, [...] Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk [...] Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds [...] In India East or West, or middle shoare [...] In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where [...] 340 [...] Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, [...] Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell [...] She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board [...] Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape [...] She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes [...] From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest [...] She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold [...] Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground [...] With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd.

[...] Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, [...] Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, [...] As to a superior Nature, bowing low, [...] 360 [...] Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place [...] None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; [...] Since by descending from the Thrones above, [...] Those happie places thou hast deignd a while [...] To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us [...] Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess [...] This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre [...] To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears [...] To sit and taste, till this meridian heat [...] Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. [...] 370 [...] Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. [...] Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such [...] Created, or such place hast here to dwell, [...] As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n [...] To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre [...] Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise [...] I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge [...] They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd [...] With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve [...] Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair [...] 380 [...] Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd [...] Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, [...] Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile [...] Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme [...] Alterd her cheek.

Rais'd of grassie terf [...] Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, [...] And on her ample Square from side to side [...] All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here [...] Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; [...] No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began [...] Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste [...] These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom [...] All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, [...] To us for food and for delight hath caus'd [...] 400 [...] The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps [...] To spiritual Natures; only this I know, [...] That one Celestial Father gives to all. [...] To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives [...] (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part [...] Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found [...] No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure [...] Intelligential substances require [...] As doth your Rational; and both contain [...] Within them every lower facultie [...] 410 [...] Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, [...] Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, [...] And corporeal to incorporeal turn. [...] For know, whatever was created, needs [...] To be sustaind and fed; of Elements [...] The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, [...] Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires [...] Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; [...] Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd [...] Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. [...] 420 [...] Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale [...] From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. [...] The Sun that light imparts to all, receives [...] From all his alimental recompence [...] In humid exhalations, and at Even [...] Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees [...] Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines [...] Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn [...] We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground [...] Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here [...] 430 [...] Varied his bounty so with new delights, [...] As may compare with Heaven; and to taste [...] Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, [...] And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly [...] The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss [...] Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch [...] Of real hunger, and concoctive heate [...] To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires [...] Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire [...] Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist [...] 440 [...] Can turn, or holds it possible to turn [...] Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold [...] As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve [...] Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups [...] With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence [...] Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, [...] Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin [...] Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts [...] Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie [...] Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. [...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n.
