5|$|The RAAF began {{considering}} {{options for}} heavy transport aircraft {{to provide a}} strategic <b>airlift</b> <b>capability</b> during the early 2000s. This investigation was initiated after the ADF deployment to East Timor in 1999 and operations in the Middle East from 2001 revealed shortcomings in the RAAF's ability to transport the increasingly large and heavy vehicles and other items of equipment used by the Australian Army. To support these operations, the ADF found that it needed long-range aircraft capable of carrying larger loads than could be accommodated in the RAAF's force of Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports. As {{a result of this}} capability gap, the ADF needed to use USAF transports and chartered Russian-built commercial heavy lift aircraft to move supplies and equipment from Australia to its forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East. This experience proved frustrating, as both categories of aircraft were often not available and the commercial transports were expensive to lease. The crash of a civil-chartered Ilyushin Il-76 in East Timor in 2003 also raised concerns within the ADF about the safety of the Russian transport aircraft. Following advocacy from the military, the Australian Government announced as part of an update to its national security strategy in December 2005 that it would consider acquiring heavy lift aircraft to supplement the RAAF's Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules transports. This initiative was one of several measures announced in the government's Defence Update 2005 paper, which sought to better prepare the ADF to operate in locations distant from Australia.|$|E

25|$|On 2 January 1975, Thiệu held an {{emergency}} meeting with General Dư Quốc Đống, {{who was in}} charge of the Phước Long situation, and other senior military figures. Đống presented a plan for the relief of Phước Long, but it was rejected because a lack of reserve forces of sufficient size available, a lack of <b>airlift</b> <b>capability,</b> and the belief that the besieged defenders could not hold out long enough for reinforcements. Thiệu decided to cede the entire province to the North Vietnamese, since it was considered to be less important than Tây Ninh, Pleiku, or Huế — economically, politically, and demographically.|$|E
500|$|The Hercules {{represented}} a huge {{improvement over the}} C-47 in payload, range, speed and manoeuvrability, as well as offering cabin pressurisation, short-takeoff-and-landing capability, and bulk loading and despatch via its rear cargo door. The Government expressed concern over the price, at one stage proposing the purchase of only three aircraft, but eventually the Air Force won approval for the twelve that it wanted. Described by the official history of the post-war RAAF as {{second only to the}} General Dynamics F-111C as the [...] "most significant" [...] acquisition by the Air Force, the Hercules gave the Australian military its first strategic <b>airlift</b> <b>capability,</b> which in years to come would provide a [...] "lifeline" [...] for deployments to Malaya, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Australia was the first country other than the United States to operate the Hercules. The RAAF's C-130As were also the last of this variant to be built.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Murdoch led {{a mission}} to examine {{potential}} new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft for the RAAF, following a shift in defence funding towards the Air Force. He advocated the F-104 Starfighter {{as a replacement for}} the CAC Sabre, two years before the Sabre entered squadron service with the RAAF, as well as nuclear-capable British Vbomber strike aircraft to augment Australia's Canberra jet bombers, and C-130 Hercules transports to replace the C-47 Dakota. Although his proposals for Vbombers and the F-104 were not taken up, the Australian government acquired the C-130 in 1958. Described as second only to the General Dynamics F-111 as the [...] "most significant" [...] purchase by the RAAF, the Hercules gave the Air Force its first strategic <b>airlift</b> <b>capability,</b> which in years to come would provide a [...] "lifeline" [...] for Australian forces deployed to Malaya, Vietnam, and other parts of South East Asia. Murdoch also recommended the locally built Vampire as a jet trainer for No.1 Applied Flying Training School; sixty-nine were later delivered as T35s by the de Havilland factory in Bankstown, New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Navy Reserve was {{the first}} {{customer}} for {{the newest member of}} the Boeing 737-700C Next-Generation family. The Clipper was ordered by the U.S. Navy to replace its fleet of aging C-9B Skytrain IIs. The C-40A is the first new logistics aircraft in 17 years to join the U.S. Navy Reserve.

The mission also continued to struggle over <b>airlift</b> <b>capabilities,</b> partially settling the matter only in December with the deployment of Russian helicopters.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{the only}} {{division}} in the Norwegian Army, the 6th utilised {{a wide range of}} modern combat equipment. Its heaviest weapons included Leopard 2A4NO MBTs, CV9030 IFVs and modernized M109A3GN howitzers. The infantry use Bv206 tracked all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and light off-road vehicles. Their <b>airlifting</b> <b>capabilities</b> were provided by the Tactical Helicopter Group of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, which is stationed at Bardufoss. The division's motto is [...] "Styrke for fred, evne til strid", or [...] "Strength for peace, capability for war".|$|R
500|$|ONUC {{forces in}} Katanga {{were under the}} command of General Prem Chand and his {{operational}} deputy, Brigadier Reginald Noronha. ONUC force strength had been raised to 18,200, 70 percent of whom were deployed in and around Katanga. Peacekeeping contingents from Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Ireland, Sweden, and Tunisia were earmarked by the UN to carry out Operation Grandslam. In order to simultaneously deploy these troops for the operation, the UN required a large <b>airlift</b> <b>capability.</b> ONUC had amassed an air transport fleet of 65 planes, the largest being Douglas DC-4s, but it was still insufficient for Operation Grandslam. Thant's military attaché, Indar Jit Rikhye, had requested assistance from the United States Department of Defense. Several days later, the United States committed its air force to provide logistical support. In November United States President John F. Kennedy offered to supply the UN with American fighter jets to exert an [...] "overwhelming show of strength from the air". Thant, though desiring forceful UN ground and air action, was eager to keep ONUC impartial and wanted to refrain from calling on too much support from any major world powers. On 16 December he declared that he would consider the American offer if the situation remained deadlocked by the Spring of 1963. This proved unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Completing {{his tour}} with No.78 Wing in mid-1954, Eaton joined Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch on an {{international}} mission to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft for the RAAF.
