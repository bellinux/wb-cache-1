5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We <b>also</b> <b>know</b> from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E

25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we <b>also</b> <b>know</b> the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.|$|E
25|$|Religious studies {{originated}} in the 19th century, when scholarly and historical analysis of the Bible had flourished, and Hindu and Buddhist texts were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included Friedrich Max Müller, in England, and Cornelius P. Tiele, in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide. In its early years, it was known as Comparative Religion or the Science of Religion and, in the USA, {{there are those who}} today <b>also</b> <b>know</b> the field as the History of religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular Mircea Eliade, from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s).

500|$|Less {{than a month}} later, Pei {{suspended}} {{his work}} at Harvard to join the National Defense Research Committee, which coordinated scientific research into US weapons technology during World WarII. Pei's background in architecture {{was seen as a}} considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: [...] "If you know how to build you should <b>also</b> <b>know</b> how to destroy." [...] The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the Pacific War. The US realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on incendiary bombs. Pei spent {{two and a half years}} with the NDRC, but has revealed few details.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{says that}} the trust that he, Levine and Lawrence have built in seven years of working {{together}} is essential.

We all know when we're onto something...We <b>also</b> <b>know</b> when something's not jelling. And that's the thing you pray you will always have. You can't believe that everything you do is hot." [...] Nevertheless, Levine points to the musical influences {{the three of them}} share completing his idea [...] "It's about finding ways to mix the classic we all love with modern songs. That's why people connect to the music on multiple levels: It's familiar-sounding but new-classic songwriting and instrumentation with a little twist".|$|E

500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot of things I don't know, I <b>also</b> <b>know</b> a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all."

500|$|Marge is a caring, understanding, and {{nurturing}} parent to Bart, but {{she refers to}} him as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics.

500|$|Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the {{two have}} a {{turbulent}} relationship. Bart regularly addresses Homer by his given name instead of [...] "Dad", while Homer in turn often refers to him as [...] "the boy". Homer has a short temper and when enraged by Bart will strangle him on impulse in a cartoonishly violent manner. One of the original ideas for the show was that Homer would be [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as their characters were explored. Marge {{is a much more}} caring, understanding and nurturing parent than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud", (season seven, 1995) she felt she was mothering Bart too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. At the beginning of the episode, Bart protested at her over-mothering but as her attitude changed, he felt bad and made it up to her. Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to experience humiliation if it means pleasing his mom. Marge has expressed an understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, but I <b>also</b> <b>know</b> what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." ...|$|E
