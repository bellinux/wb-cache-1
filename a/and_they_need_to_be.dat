25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.|$|E

He {{was a prominent}} opponent of the Calgary Declaration on national unity in late 1997, describing it as an [...] "appeasement strategy" [...] against Quebec nationalism. He called for federalist politicians to reject this strategy, and approach future constitutional talks from the position that [...] "Quebec separatists are the problem <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fixed". In late 1999, Harper called {{for the federal government}} to establish clear rules for any future Quebec referendum on sovereignty. Some have identified Harper's views as an influence on the Chrétien government's Clarity Act.|$|E
