40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the consumption of}} <b>added</b> <b>fats</b> and oils across the European centres and countries participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). DESIGN AND SETTING: 24 -Hour dietary recalls were collected by means of standardised computer-guided interviews in 27 redefined EPIC centres across 10 European countries. SUBJECTS: From an initial number of 36 900 subjects, single dietary recalls from 22 924 women and 13 031 men in the age range of 35 - 74 years were included. RESULTS: Mean daily intake of <b>added</b> <b>fats</b> and oils varied between 16. 2 g (Varese, Italy) and 41. 1 g (Malmö, Sweden) in women and between 24. 7 g (Ragusa, Italy) and 66. 0 g (Potsdam, Germany) in men. Total mean lipid intake by consumption of <b>added</b> <b>fats</b> and oils, including those used for sauce preparation, ranged between 18. 3 (Norway) and 37. 2 g day- 1 (Greece) in women and 28. 4 (Heidelberg, Germany) and 51. 2 g day- 1 (Greece) in men. The Mediterranean EPIC centres with high olive oil consumption combined with low animal fat intake contrasted with the central and northern European centres where fewer vegetable oils, more animal fats and {{a high proportion of}} margarine were consumed. The consumption of <b>added</b> <b>fats</b> and oils of animal origin was highest in the German EPIC centres, followed by the French. The contribution of <b>added</b> <b>fats</b> and oils to total energy intake ranged from 8 % in Norway to 22 % in Greece. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a high variation in dietary intake of <b>added</b> <b>fats</b> and oils in EPIC, providing a good opportunity to elucidate the role of dietary fats in cancer aetiology...|$|R

50|$|Omante {{occurred}} when the people sacrificed an adult bear, but when they caught a bear cub they performed a different ritual which is called Iomante, in the Ainu language, or Kumamatsuri. Kumamatsuri translates to mean “the bear festival” and Iomante means “sending off”. The event of Kumamatsuri began with the capture of a young bear cub. As {{if he was a}} child given by the gods, the cub was fed human food from a carved wooden platter and was treated better than Ainu children for they thought of him as a god. If the cub was too young and lacked the teeth to properly chew food, a nursing mother will let him suckle from her own breast. When the cub reaches 2-3 years of age, the cub is taken to the altar and then sacrificed. Usually, Kumamatsuri occurs in midwinter when the bear meat is the best from the <b>added</b> <b>fat.</b> The villagers will shoot it with both normal and ceremonial arrows, make offerings, dance, and pour wine on top of the cub corpse. The words of sending off for the bear god are then recited. This festivity lasts for three days and three nights to properly return the bear god to his home.|$|E

The experiment was conducted at a commercial swine research facility in southwest Minnesota. A total of 1, 093 pigs (initially 171. 3 lb, PIC) were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments. Pigs were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets. The treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of glycerol (0, 2. 5, or 5 %) and <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> (0 or 6 %). Overall (d 0 to 28), there was a fat × glycerol interaction (P < 0. 04) for ADFI. When 5 % glycerol was added to diets without <b>added</b> <b>fat,</b> ADFI decreased; however, ADFI did not change when glycerol was added to diets containing 6 % <b>added</b> <b>fat.</b> Pigs fed diets with <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> had improved (P < 0. 01) ADG and F/G compared with pigs fed diets with no <b>added</b> <b>fat.</b> Increasing glycerol decreased ADG (linear, P < 0. 02) and ADFI (linear, P < 0. 04) and tended (linear, P < 0. 08) to worsen F/G, a result of the negative effect of adding glycerol to diets without fat.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 200 gilts {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of replacing conventionally processed soybean meal with extruded-expelled soybean meal on finishing pig growth performance. Dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with two sources of soybean meal (solvent-extracted or extruded-expelled) and three levels of <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> (none, 3. 4, and 7 % in Phase 1 than decreasing in subsequent phases). Energy levels were adjusted such that the higher energy in extruded-expelled soybean meal (with or without <b>added</b> <b>fat)</b> was equal to that provided by solvent-extracted soybean meal with <b>added</b> <b>fat.</b> From 54 to 135 lb, pigs fed extruded-expelled soybean meal had improved ADG and F/G compared to those fed solvent-extracted soybean meal.

From 135 to 270 lb, pigs fed extruded-expelled soybean meal and(or) increasing <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> had decreased feed intake. For the overall growing-finishing period, ADG was unaffected by increasing energy density. However, ADFI was decreased and F/G improved as energy density of the diet was increased either with extruded-expelled soybean meal and(or) <b>added</b> <b>fat.</b> Carcass leanness was not affected by dietary treatment.

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of increasing <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> on pig growth performance 1, 440 pigs (each initially 26 lb) were used in a 21 d growth trial. Pigs were fed diets containing none, 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5, and 6. 0 % choice white grease. Increasing <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> reduced (linear, P< 0. 05) ADFI and improved F/G. Although ADG was not significantly affected by fat level, increasing <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> from 0 to 1. 5 % or greater resulted in a 1 -lb increase in total weight gain over the entire trial. The greatest improvement in feed efficiency was also observed with the addition of the first 1. 5 % fat; however, further increases in dietary fat continued to linearly reduce ADFI and improve F/G. These results would suggest that from 25 to 50 lb, 1. 5 to 3. 0 % <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> optimized pig growth performance. Based on the results of Experiment 1, we conducted Experiment 2 to confirm the optimum level of <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> in combination with increased use of crystalline amino acids (3 vs 6 lb/ton L-lysine + other amino acids) to meet the pig's lysine requirements. In Experiment 2, 1, 152 pigs (each initially 21 lb) were fed one of four dietary treatments arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial. Main effects included <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> (3 or 6 %) and crystalline amino acid amounts (3 vs 6 lb/ton Llysine HCl with other amino acids added to maintain proper amino acid to lysine ratios). No differences were observed in growth performance, but based on current ingredient prices, reducing the amount of soybean meal by the use of higher levels of crystalline amino acids increased margin over feed cost. In conclusion, these data indicate that 3 % <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> will optimize growth performance and margin over feed costs, and that the use of greater amounts of crystalline amino acids (up to 6 lb/ton L-lysine with added L-threonine and DL methionine) are efficiently used by the pig and will also help further increase margin over feed costs...|$|E

There were a total of 20 replications per treatment. All pigs were fed a common diet with 30 % DDGS until 20 d prior to slaughter, at which point they were weighed and allotted to dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with 2 diet types, a corn-soybean meal–based diet with or without 30 % DDGS and <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> of 0 or 5 % (group 1 = tallow; group 2 = choice white grease). Diets were formulated on a standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine basis and balanced on an SID lysine to NE ratio. There were no treatment × group interactions for any of the measured responses, so data for the two groups were combined for analysis. For the overall experiment, there was a tendency (P < 0. 10) for a diet type × <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> interaction for ADG; this interaction was significant (P < 0. 05) for F/G and caloric efficiency on an ME and NE basis. These were the result of pigs fed the diet with 30 % DDGS having greater ADG and F/G improvements when fat was included compared with those fed the corn-soybean meal–based diet without DDGS. For the caloric efficiency interaction, pigs fed 30 % DDGS had an improvement with <b>added</b> <b>fat,</b> whereas those fed the corn-soybean meal–based diet with <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> had worse caloric efficiency than pigs fed the corn-soy diet without <b>added</b> <b>fat.</b> Although diet type did not affect final live weight, pigs fed the diet containing DDGS had reduced HCW (P < 0. 05), which was the result of reduced carcass yield (P < 0. 05). Adding 5 % fat to the diet containing DDGS did not improve carcass yield. Jowl fat iodine value was increased by <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> (P < 0. 05) and feeding DDGS (P < 0. 05). For economics, there was a diet type × <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> interaction (P < 0. 05) for cost per pound of gain, which was the result of a larger increase in cost for pigs fed <b>added</b> <b>fat</b> in the corn-soybean meal–based diet compared with the diet containing DDGS.
