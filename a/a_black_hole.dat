5|$|<b>A</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is {{a region}} of spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E
5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} explanation {{proposed by}} Friedwardt Winterberg {{is that in}} the course of a gravitational collapse and in reaching the event horizon of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> all matter disintegrates into a burst of gamma radiation.|$|E

The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded.

5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far denser than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> This {{may be explained by}} considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{gravitational}} waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. They {{are expected to}} yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, about certain kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes {{in the very early}} universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> merger.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect is}} very small but {{measurable}} on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first observed in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (see Sachs-Wolfe effect).|$|E
40|$|When two point particles, {{coupled to}} three {{dimensional}} gravity {{with a negative}} cosmological constant, approach {{each other with a}} sufficiently large center of mass energy, then <b>a</b> BTZ <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is created.

50|$|By {{their very}} nature, <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> do not {{directly}} emit any electromagnetic radiation {{other than the}} hypothetical Hawking radiation, so astrophysicists searching for <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> must generally rely on indirect observations.

40|$|We study {{neutrino}} spin oscillations in <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> backgrounds. In {{the case}} of <b>a</b> charged <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> the maximum frequency of oscillations is a monotonically increasing function of the charge. For <b>a</b> rotating <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> the maximum frequency decreases with increasing the angular momentum. In both cases, the frequency of spin oscillations decreases as {{the distance from the}} <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> grows. <b>As</b> a phenomenological application of our results, we study simple bipolar neutrino system which is an interesting example of collective neutrino oscillations. We show that the precession frequency of the flavor pendulum {{as a function of the}} neutrino number density will be higher for <b>a</b> charged/non-rotating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> compared with <b>a</b> neutral/rotating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> respectively.

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E

The supernova then devolves into <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> where Arrow falls. The burst of shock waves and {{maximum engine power}} enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless insectoid crew member named Scroop.|$|E
5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to astronomers are quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> can lead to the formation of jets, in which focused beams of matter are flung away into space at speeds near that of light.|$|E
50|$|If virtual <b>black</b> <b>holes</b> exist, {{they provide}} a {{mechanism}} for proton decay. This is because when <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole's</b> mass increases via mass falling into the hole, and then decreases when Hawking radiation is emitted from the hole, the elementary particles emitted are, in general, {{not the same as}} those that fell in. Therefore, if two of a proton's constituent quarks fall into <b>a</b> virtual <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> it is possible for an antiquark and a lepton to emerge, thus violating conservation of baryon number.|$|R
50|$|This is not {{necessarily}} true with <b>a</b> Kerr <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> An observer falling into <b>a</b> Kerr <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> {{may be able to}} avoid the central singularity by making clever use of the inner event horizon associated with this class of <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> This makes it possible for the Kerr <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> to act as a sort of wormhole, possibly even a traversable wormhole.|$|R
50|$|However, Carter's {{calculations}} {{also show}} that <b>a</b> would-be <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> with these parameters would be 'super-extremal'.

It would also give rise to closed timelike curves.|$|R
